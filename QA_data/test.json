[["To what extent is the softer demand recently experienced, a function of things that aren't related to the macro, or say shifting geographies that you referred to Matt, but rather maybe other structural things, whether its capital outflows or other? ", ["So on the Baccarat side, in Las Vegas and I'll also let Marilyn jump in here. But I don\u2019t really think we are seeing any long-term sustainable trends I think we are experiencing exactly what you understand. And we definitely think the second quarter is going to be little better than the first quarter based on what we're seeing right now. So, I don\u2019t want to be predicting Baccarat volumes. But Las Vegas over the long-term is a global destination for those customers from around Asia, and I feel very comfortable with that. Marilyn, what do you think?\nMarilyn Spiegel\nThere's really no structural change here that would impact these players. So it's all the global headwinds. And I think that hopefully that these players will be back if that's what the past has been.\nMatt Maddox\nOn the M&A front, so Joe as I laid out in my opening remarks, our growth pipeline is quite robust. And the large capital spend is now behind us after a multiyear capital development program as we're about to open Encore Boston Harbor and really become -- really start generating lots of free cash flow, which is one of the reasons that we raised our dividend by 33% this year. When it comes to M&A, we will always be looking for opportunities for assets that are tier 1 first class assets with licenses that are protected in cities that are global destinations.\nSo while we are not pursuing any acquisitions at this stage, we will along with all of our competitors, I'm sure, be looking at opportunities that you can't replicate through development. We are a development company at heart. We're focused on new projects. But we will continually look to enhance shareholder value without increasing our leverage profile and without hurting our free cash flow story."]], ["Matt, just coming back the layers a little bit more on the market share issue, and you\u2019ve said this a lot on your past calls you want to stay in the 15% to 17% range but if you could just help me with the math for a second. ", ["That's exactly right. So premium, we definitely lost some share in premium mass and the premium mass business around town was down. Core mass, which is we define it by geography and by average bet, core mass is up over 13% but that was not enough for us to keep up our share in the market. I think our -- Wynn was up roughly 3% sequentially, and that was that that was less than the market. And that's because we're more reliant on the premium segment. But our strategy is working and it shows that Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau can really compete in any markets.\nAnd Felicia, you've been watching this for a long time. People get really focused on core mass, because that business is always there. Premium and VIP get compressed temporarily, and then the growth happens. So I don't know how long that that area is going to be compressed, but what I do know is the demand is still there. And so we feel very comfortable that when that business begins to come back, we're going to be perfectly situated to capture it."]], ["And while that's not a new comment in general, I don\u2019t believe I've heard you say that on a call like this or I've heard Wynn, in general, talk about this. ", ["Well, I don\u2019t think you should look into the performance in the quarter at all. I've just noticed some of our competitors another people tend to be commenting a lot on these emerging markets, in particular in Asia and that they could have an impact on the large global gaming jurisdictions. And I just don't believe that Macau and Las Vega are going to be cannibalized by those small tertiary jurisdictions that are emerging. In the short-term, they could. We're not seeing that right now. But over the longer term, people always go back to the places that they enjoy the most. And so I wasn\u2019t addressing that relative to this quarter, I was just addressing it relative to what we're seeing in the market and what we believe will be the long-term success of Macau and Las Vegas."]], ["And then, just quickly on Boston, I mean, we're a month and a half out, how are things progressing in terms of getting in the staffing in line and then infrastructure around the property? ", ["The construction is almost essentially complete. The building looks like it is in great shape. Staffing, we have 90% of the people either onboard or within offer. So, we are in line to -- and on time to complete almost everything we need to have a great opening. I don't know if the opening date will be June 23rd or a week or two later because we're going to make sure that it's flawless. And clearly, the regulatory complexity we've been through has been a challenge. And so, we are now doubling back. And the team we have on the ground there is terrific. We are ready to open. We may give our self another week, we may not, but the property looks great."]], ["But, can you help us think about any other sort of strategic aspects of attributes that may be compelling to whether that's in different segments of the market, right, where there more value-driven customers might help you branch out? ", ["I hate to lay out our strategy for everybody, David. But, I'll tell you what we're not going to do. We're not going to go into the value business. We are high-end operators, we're quality operators and we will be looking at quality assets around the world. We're not regional gaming operators. So, that's not an area where we're going to be branching out in a significant way, given there will likely be lots of regional gaming properties for sale. So, we're focused on where the growth is happening globally. We believe that Asia will continue to grow faster than the West. And if there are opportunities in those areas where we believe it fits with our profile and it will be accretive and it will be able to capture long-term growth for our Company and our shareholders, we will take a look at it. But we do not have anything right now that we're focused on."]], ["First with the respect to Matt when you talked about Wynn Macau and some of the redesign, and reinvestment at that property and some of the stuff coming online in 4Q.\nThe disruption that you may be experiencing now, do you think that accelerates from here? ", ["I'll start that Joe then I'll turn it over to Ian. I think that we, in the fourth quarter you could feel at Wynn Macau some of that disruption and I think that those volume levels, again all market dependent are in this range and sort of what we're expecting until we can re-launch the property at the end of the year. So I do know Ian if you want to follow up on that.\nIan Coughlan\nAs we look at the construction program it's essentially over 12 months. We've already gone through three months of it. We do manage with a great team at Wynn Macau to contain the impact and any business damage, but there's clearly disruption and it will increase over the next six months.\nAreas will be inaccessible. There will be a reduction in certain table play. It does affect customer base. So, but we are hopeful that we can minimize the impact and run along from our fourth quarter and keep going until the fourth quarter of this year.\nMatt Maddox\nAnd just as you see the first two quarters of 2018 were quite strong for Wynn Macau and a lot of that was bolstered by mid-tier junkets which has really been the segment in Macau that has declined by far the most. So\u2026\nQ \u2013Joe Greff\nGreat. And then also Matt can you just talk about sort of the length of collections from junkets and direct players. And I know your bad debt expense went up marginally, but can you just talk about what you're seeing on that front? That's all for me.\nMatt Maddox\nSure. So we talk about this a lot to try to decide if there's a trend that we're noticing. I was in Macau two weeks ago and met with Head of Suncity, Alvin, in particular to talk about what he think and collections are not an issue right now. Liquidity doesn't appear to be an issue. It's really more caution.\nSo this is not the scenario that we saw in 2014 and 2015. That's not the case at all. We're not having any of our junket operations come to us and ask us for additional advance which is -- that's usually a clear indication of a credit bubble.\nQ \u2013 Joe Greff\nSo the caution is coming from the player not from the junket?\nMatt Maddox\nYes from both. I think everyone's learned a valuable lesson, in particular, the really large players that had a multibillion-dollar business. And so again the mid-tier junkets are the ones that we've seen decline, but the three major junket operators still appeared to be healthy.\nIan Coughlan\nThere's also much tighter regulation off the junket market and the DIC and DICJ and the governments have done an excellent job in bringing very professional levels of management to the junkets. The exposure we had a number of years ago has dissipated.\nQ \u2013 Joe Greff\nThank you for the comments."]], ["And I know there was an easy comp and the bigger portion of that was really driven by occupancy, but I was just wondering if there was anything extraordinary in the quarter that might have been driving that result, because there seems to be a bit of narrative out there that high-end operators like yourselves could be having difficulty raising rates from where they are now. ", ["Absolutely. I was delighted to see the fourth quarter RevPAR. The convention business was great and came in superstrong. And so that's really what you're seeing in the fourth quarter. For the first quarter and the rest of our year here, it's solid, but we had an outstanding fourth quarter. Coming back to the property, as you know I was here and then I had a prior competed against this property. There is no better set of assets. There is no strong growth, employee team, management team in all of gaming. And so, I'm delighted to lead this team. I think we have operating opportunities really with all of our assets. And specifically in casino, we can drive more from our casino block, get more off of our floor. So that's where I'll be focus going forward."]], ["And as you do that, would it be fair to think that look revenue market share might be one thing on the VIP side, but obviously this could have an impact or a material impact on EBITDA and mix as it relates to profitability? ", ["Well, clearly premium mass business is more profitable than mid-tier junket business. So we're not just focus -- we don't generally focus on monthly gaming market share given what happens between VIP slots and mass. We're focused on where do we position ourselves in the Greater Bay region and area with 60 million people, a GDP of over $3 trillion a new bridge that's connected Macau to one of the busiest and nicest airports in the world. How do we position ourselves for the future, and how we do that as we focus on their premium customer, it's making the decisions about where they want to go and where they want to stay. And that's what we're doing at Wynn Macau."]], ["I guess what I was attempting to get to was that after you open \u2013 after you pay your final bills in Boston you become \u2013 you should become a significant I mean a really significant free cash flow generator. ", ["Well, you're exactly right. Once the bills are paid in Boston, the free cash flow generation for this company goes up significantly. Because these other large-scale projects I'm talking about definitely take a couple of years before the spend gets up and running or even longer. So you're exactly right. In 2021 and then into 2022 the free cash flow profile changes quite significantly there. Craig, do you have any thoughts \u2013 ?\nCraig Billings\nNo. I think that's right. And as we talked about Harry, we will look at all the routes to make sure that we have portion the appropriate amount of that free cash flow to shareholders."]], ["I know you don't give explicit guidance, but as we look at 2019, can you just give a sense for some of the puts and takes to think about the market. ", ["Hey it's Craig. So, yes, great question. So, if you look at 2019 and I think we were pretty explicit with some of the sell-side analyst subsequent to the Q3 call to try to help frame up Las Vegas. But just to reiterate some of that. If you look at our first quarter of 2018, it was I think a record first quarter for the property ever. So, we're --\nMatt Maddox\nIt was. Yes.\nCraig Billings\nWe're going to have a tough comp frankly in Q1 of 2019. You probably should look back to Q1 of 2017 to get a better sense to where the property might perform and recognize that we're in a slightly different cost environment now due to some Department of Labor regulations that we talked about an a prior call.\nBeyond that we're really looking at the overall baccarat volumes, which as we talked about on the Q3 call, tend to be very global. And so much of the circumspection that we take towards the overall Chinese macro-economy extends to Las Vegas as well. And so we didn't really need to wait to see how Chinese New Year plays out to determine what we think about that in the year as well. Matt, do you have any?\nMatt Maddox\nYes, sure. I think as I said in my opening remarks, Las Vegas is a marketer's market. I think we will be focused on how are we going to increase our share in casino revenue and how we're going to drive our rate.\nWe have structural -- new construction programs that are coming in to help us drive rate. That will start in 2020, but we're focused right now every day on how are we're going to gain share on the casino side, in particular, the domestic side, and grow our baccarat business because it's worth looking in our global profile.\nWe will now have three regions that our high-end customers will want to visit. They will want to go to Boston. There are a lot of direct flights from Asia straight to Boston. They will want to come to Las Vegas. And so we're all working on how are we going to create the Wynn experience globally so that we can continue to take share from our competitors."]], ["Matt you've already I think I alluded to this in some of your prepared remarks and also in the answer to Joe's question a little bit, but could you just kind of characterize the customer behavior in terms of just breaking it down a little bit by spend per visit and number of visits? ", ["Yeah. I think you nailed it. The contraction of confidence is the way to look at it. When we look at our daily visitation to Wynn Palace, for example, it's roughly 20,000 people a day right now in line with where it's been in the past. So we're not seeing a large fall off in visitation or the place feels really busy. It's really in the premium segment where there's been a slight contraction in confidence. And as everyone that's been following this space for more than 10 years know, it's temporary, but it takes a little time to get that confidence back."]], ["It sounds like you guys really dug around some to kind of investigate what you were seeing for the \u2013 it sounds like maybe the last six weeks of the second quarter.\nSo then kind of the key question I have is, kind of what are the people on the ground telling you about what might have changed in July to get activity levels back? ", ["Well, July is just a much stronger month than June, given the World Cup impact and what was going on due to seasonality. Ian, I'll let you take up what you're seeing in July.\nIan Michael Coughlan - Wynn Macau Ltd.\nIt was the World Cup bounce back. The liquidity returned to the junket market particularly and also our direct program, premium mass was up. And what we saw during the second quarter in the junkets in addition to new rooms having opened in other areas is when new rooms open up, players are sometimes diverted from existing rooms just to show business for the beginning of the new room.\nSo I believe that that was the factor. We also had low hold in a couple of junkets in the second quarter which normalized, and that brought players back as well. Sometimes the junkets will move players to other rooms because they're worried about increasing bad luck. So we just basically got back to normal at all business levels in all sectors of the business. One of the ups in Wynn Palace is we haven't plateaued. We continue to grow our business, and 80% of our room mix is now going to the casino sector, up from 75% in June."]], ["So, Ian, given the quarter's results and as you look forward and you see new competition coming on, which should continue and you work to stem the market share losses, can you talk to us about some of the things or some of the plans you have to kind of better face that competition? ", ["No. And Felicia, it's Matt. One thing I should point out is our market share in July, all normal hold, was 17%; the second highest that we've ever experienced in our history. So new competition does not mean market share loss. What we have with Wynn Palace is we're actually opening two new restaurants within the next two months, and then we're continuing this expansion. Wynn Palace is going to continue to be a market share taker. We still have Lisboa coming up, we have the light rail that will be opening at some point in the near future.\nWe will become the hub of activity in the center. And with Wynn Macau downtown, with the reinvestment that we're going to be putting into the original casino, it will really revitalize that property. And so, I believe that both Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace are going to continue to increase their share."]], ["It would help that segment, but then it'd also help on the premium mass side.\nAnd then, maybe you can just talk about 2Q versus 1Q sort of directionally when you look at your premium mass performance in Macau, whether it's in the aggregate or at each property, how did it do sequentially in the 2Q versus the 1Q? ", ["Okay. So in terms of the premium mass piece, what we saw, obviously, in the first quarter, we had a really, really strong March, in particular downtown at the Peninsula. And the premium mass segment, as you know, faded off into the May and June period. May was not as strong as we had anticipated, but we've really seen it come back in July. So we're anticipating the Macau market, even with some \u2013 August should not be that tough of a comp given what happened last August, but we believe that the Macau market is going to continue to grow."]], ["Could you give us a little bit more color in terms of CapEx if there intended to be any rooms on that or if you expect any tables on that piece of real estate, is my first question.\nAnd the second question, obviously, premium mass has become a bigger focus. ", ["Sure. So on the entertainment development that we're working on, it is solely food and beverage and entertainment. It will currently take up roughly about half the site and leaving the other half for future development for things like you pointed out if they're needed, but this will be just an entertainment and food and beverage focused facility. And we're quite excited about it. We're not there yet to be giving CapEx estimates for this project. That will be coming over the next few months.\nWe really don't break out premium mass versus the ground play quarter-over-quarter. Needless to say, you know our brand and what we stand for. We're a premium house. That means premium VIP, premium mass, premiums slots. That's the customer that we cater to, but we typically do not give the percentages."]], ["But just to step back big picture, you know since this is the first time you are addressing the investment community in this \u2013 I was just wondering if you could walk us through your vision, both in the near term and the longer term and if you could frame your response in regards to you know governments, organic growth, CapEx and capital return that would be helpful. ", ["Sure, so the company\u2019s current asset base is the best in the business I believe. And our growth profile is quite strong. And so what we are doing is we are reprioritizing where we want to spend our capital based on where we think we can get more immediate growth. So I have re-prioritized spending money in Macau, and looking at those projects and in what\u2019s going to attract new customers and keep our customers at those properties longer.\nIn Las Vegas, our previous project it actually the budget was over $3 billion. That was not sustainable, and so we are taking a hard look at what is sustainable here and what\u2019s going to keep attracting our customer. So we are moving forward with the lagoon and we are going, and I\u2019m a big believer in the future of Las Vegas and so what were going to be coming back to the investment community with later this year is where our next development opportunity will be. Will it be on the lagoon? Will it be on the Las Vegas strip with a property we purchased in January, those are things that we are studying now and we\u2019ll spend a lot of time on.\nIn terms of future development, we \u2013 I am going to be spending more time and we\u2019re really enhancing our team to focus on the Japan opportunity. It\u2019s something that I think is getting time is getting, ripe for additional investment and we are really focused on that. We think we have a great story there we\u2019re already talking to potential consortium partners. We are focusing on locations. I have dedicated a couple of people there, that are full time, that are developers and understand how to work with the governments in terms of what it is that they want to accomplish.\nSo the vision is we are going to keep developing. We are going to be at the top of the market. We are going to use our 150 people in our design and development team to execute properties at the highest standards that are going to drive shareholder returns."]], ["If you could talk through your capital allocation priorities specifically in Macau, because you did indicate in your prepared remarks about some spending on the Peninsula, you could talk through that would be helpful? ", ["Hey, David, it's Craig. I'll start and then I'll pass it to Matt. So as I mentioned earlier in the Q&A that share repurchase authorization that we're seeking is purely procedural and is done by most all Hong Kong companies and is not reflective in any way of intent. You actually look at our peers and their filings and see very very similar proposals.\nMatthew Maddox\nThe capital allocation strategy at Macau is to continue to focus on investment and non-gaming amenities that will drive additional customers to Macau and accelerating the design of those and those investments because we feel like there's great opportunity there. And we'll continue to always revisit our dividend policy there relative to our free cash flow."]], ["And just one more, given the strength in Las Vegas and your outlook in Las Vegas and the opportunities that you have there some which are underway and others that are land across the street. ", ["We are internally big believers in Las Vegas. I think the future of Las Vegas is very bright. What it is that we build will be consistent with the Wynn brand and with luxury and with the customer that we have been focused on for the last 15 years. So we're moving forward with lagoon and we are reevaluating what our next development opportunity should be, but we are moving forward with ideas for a new development opportunity whether it on lagoon or across the street, because over the next number of years we are believers in Las Vegas.\nWhat we done in Macau is just accelerate a lot of the ideas that we've been working on and begin to try to move that forward in more expedited basis. And then we're always looking at international development. So if something comes up like a Japan or pick another place that has great rules and regulations and is a large opportunity and is potentially better returns than the company we'll have to look at and shift its focus. But for now we're monitoring all three and aggressively pursuing all three."]], ["Maybe just to clarify because in your opening remarks you talked about March 2020 still being the date, so would the only thing going forward right now as planned in Vegas as the convention center? ", ["No, no, that's not the right way to think about it. So the convention centers underway. We got $35 million out of that budget and enhance the customer experience. The lagoon is underway. So that is going to be targeted as an amenity for our 4700 rooms here at Wynn Las Vegas that will reinvent daytime activity in Las Vegas. I don't say that lightly. We're going to have watercraft, great water sports, beachfront, we're going to have some restaurants and some bars. It's going to be a really fun place to be for our customers.\nThe next multibillion-dollar development of new hotel rooms, new restaurant, the full integrated resort that is what we are examining right now, before that was on the lagoon and being programmed as phase 1B. That's what we are re-examining to decide, do we want to focus there or do we want to focus across the street for the next resort."]], ["Where do you see the potential opportunity and any other metrics you could give us around -- you talked about bringing in even higher quality customers than you had been bringing in? ", ["Sure. Linda and Ian, why don't you talk about the comp mix in the hotel?\nIan Coughlan\nWell, as I addressed earlier, we've listed the number of rooms at Wynn Palace that are casino-related, some 53% in the first quarter last year to 73% in the first quarter of this year. So, we continue to have space in the property to bring more high-end customers in, casino high end customers. So, that's our opportunity.\nAs the property gets more familiar with players, we have a lot more repeat business, new customers are being introduced, all the marketing efforts we're making are bearing fruit. So, we just continue the things that we're doing. We believe that we're still on lift-off and ramping up.\nLinda Chen\nAlso, actually, the quality of our room product is really the top in the market. So, we're able to progressively move our customer up to even the next level of room and suite products that they haven't experienced before. So, we have the penthouse and the villas, and those are actually new, if you may, experience for a lot of the premium mass customers. So, we've been able to progressively increase their flight based on the facility that they get to experience.\nIan Coughlan\nIt may be a good opportunity for Ciaran to talk about the strength of mass at Wynn Macau as well. And one of the key focus is just to not cannibalize Wynn Macau.\nCiaran Carruthers\nSo, at Wynn Macau, we're obviously seeing continued growth in the mass business despite the gravitational pull of Cotai product segment. And we've done that -- obviously, we've been running very, very high utilization of our room product and casino for a long time where about 94% or 95% of our rooms are used by the casino that really, for us, has been a better yield. And the quality of the customers there and the market has seen -- has done exceptionally good job in the optimization strategy, getting better and better quality customers into that room and move in a lot of the business that we had previously seen, not lodging with us but staying in these -- in the hotel rooms.\nAnd just in case, not to cannibalize our business. Not moving anything across the Wynn Palace unnecessarily. We have a lot of customers that have gone across there, and now customers that enjoy both properties, customers that have been Cotai customers that have now moved to Wynn Palace, enjoying the Wynn experience and have moved across the Wynn Macau. So, for us, it's really been about utilizing and optimizing the quality of the customer in the room.\nLinda Chen\nAlso, where we actually experienced downtown at Wynn Macau is we've been able to leverage the facility at Wynn Palace to reactivate a lot of our inactive customers that we lost from Wynn Macau to the Cotai market. So, once after our Wynn Palace property is available, we actually have been reintroducing our company and brand to those customers. So, now they've come across both properties. So, Wynn Macau has experienced a lot of, if you may, reactivation customer that hasn't visited in the past couple of years.\nMatthew Maddox\nOkay. Thanks."]], ["Steve, maybe just to stick with the same kind of same thing on tax reform, but obviously there was a big impact on the company's financials literally to this quarter and some movements on, I think, deferred taxes.

Most companies in America are going through this exercise right now. Because as Steve pointed out, tax bill is very beneficial for everyone in the U.S. And that was really the guidance is not clear, but that was where we came out with EY and our accountants and we're going to continue to work through that over the year.\nCraig Billings\nIt's very mechanical, Sean.

", ["Well, first of all, there is going to be specific guidance according to announcements, comments made by the government -- the Chief Executive in his testimony before the legislature. In calendar year '18, there will be specific guidance because one of the concessionaires expires in '20, at least on paper. However, on a larger sense, we enjoy a good deal of confidence, and we have been given reason to have confidence that our businesses will continue after the initial concession expiration dates. That confidence is based upon the kinds of conversations we have with the government. But on even a larger sense, this very situation was faced by the other special administrative region, Hong Kong. I'll remind everybody that the status of Hong Kong and Macau in the Chinese firmament is that each of those cities is a special administrative region abbreviated to SAR. And in the SAR at Hong Kong, the same situation existed much earlier than it did in Macau. The turnover took place, leases on buildings and properties expired and the central government seamlessly extended those things and accommodated a stable, stable commercial environment in Hong Kong and has done so in the transition of Macau.\nThe only thing that the central government of Beijing did with the transition from Portuguese Macau to its current status was to buttress and support that city and its fundamental business and roots in any way possible. The prosperity of Macau post the Chinese takeover in '99 and the pre-Mainland Chinese concession period is stark. What China stands for is stability. They don't like to disrupt things. They do like foreign investment. When we first came, I was invited to the capital to [indiscernible] where the center of power is in Beijing. And at that time, the vice premier invited my wife and I as part of their protocol to welcome foreign investment. The atmosphere in China has not changed. And Macau, we are so stitched into that community with our employees and our company that we feel comfortable in the situation. But on the other hand, we do not speak for the government nor can we affirmatively anticipate what they may do. But like anything else, judge people by their past performance. Human beings tend to have an element of consistency to their behavior. And on that basis, we're pretty relaxed about our future and spend our time, and I have encouraged as recently as last few months in meetings with the government to proceed with planning of our Phase 2 expansions. I know that Mr. Adelson feels the same way I do, because I have this conversation with Sheldon frequently. We talk about matters in Macau with MGM and with the Sands on a regular basis. And I think all three of us feel the same way. Jim Murren, Sheldon himself. I know Rob Goldstein shares our feeling on that. How about you and Ian?\nIan Coughlan\nAbsolutely, yes.\nStephen Wynn\nI mean, you want to be really candid about this. We don't want to hold any information that we don't have. We want to share. I know how important this question is to everybody, and it should be. And Craig, any of us want to -- is Linda on the call?\nCraig Billings\nNo. She's actually flying out here.\nUnidentified Company Representative\nOh, she is on her way here? well, anyway, the boss is here.\nStephen Wynn\nIs Karen here?\nUnidentified Company Representative\nKaren is not here. Just myself and Frederick.\nStephen Wynn\nOkay, so I got Frederick and you.\nUnidentified Company Representative\nMatt, Craig and I.\nStephen Wynn\nThat's the latest and the deepest response we can give you."]], ["You mentioned, wanting to be open as soon as possible to capture the growth there, but you also referred to it taking 2 to 3 years of design for the properties in Macau. ", ["Sure, Robin. First of all, with regard to the area known as the golf course land. DeRuyter Butler and Roger Thomas and the rest of his -- and operations have been involved with the design of the golf course for over two years already. And that led to our satisfaction and the beginning of construction. I have already started the analysis and the planning of the property across the street. The West Wynn property. And I'm here for continuing design conversations on Macau and our adjacent 11 acre developments. Sometimes things move faster than others. One of the really great things about the property, the West Wynn property, Wynn West, whatever is across street, I'm not going to call the Frontier anymore. And I'm certainly not going to call it Alon that was an important project.\nI'm going to say this, when you are adding to the existing 10 million feet of Wynn, you get a tremendous opportunity to piggyback many of the things that are already built because it's only a 100 feet across the street. We are going to connect with an air-conditioned umbilical hallway. We built the acceptance ramp, the platform and the escalators for that on our side of the street when we built the beach club, there is escalators and a big acceptance platform between Wynn and Encore, where we're going to connect to the property across the street. I always held the conviction that we'd end up with it. So I built the place to connect, when I built the beach club. It's there already. And so what we're going to do across the street is going to go rather quickly, because I have been giving a thought for a long time and sketching with it.\nAnd so I don't think that the design development period is going to be very long on the Wynn West property. And the design process, the creative design process on this eastern development on the golf course has been two years in process. A lot of thought. Tremendous modeling. There were so many options on the golf course because of our water rights. So many possibilities. We exhausted all of them, especially with an eye to how we could monetize everything. Make sure that made a lot of money for us. Budgets, I think that was the last part. We have budgeted our building that's currently -- that we're doing the grading for now, our convention and meeting building that was, Matt, was it 460,000, 480,000 feet?\nMatthew Maddox\n460,000 feet.\nStephen Wynn\n460,000 square feet of ballrooms, meeting rooms and convention and catering offices and that sort of thing. And our budget. And we got prices on it and we know where we stand on that. As the final budget on the lagoon is awaiting, we just finished giving a final short plan, meaning the shape and the nuance of the in and the outs, the exact final frozen shoreline shape to the people at Crystal Lagoons. When their drawing comes back, we've got a pretty clear idea what is going to cost. We will have a specific bid from our contractor for that. So as each phase of the development proceeds, we wait till we get complete working drawings. We bid the working drawings. And when we're satisfied with them, we start construction. And we don't start construction until we have a firm price based upon technical drawings of at least 80%. Robin, if you're asking me, I think your question is specific in general, we won't start any job until we have a final price based upon technical drawings. On the other hand, you're wondering if I got any idea what it's going to cost? Am I reading it right?"]], ["And one thing you guys didn't mention on the call and maybe your feel is it didn't really play much into the quarter, but obviously that the typhoon was a bigger deal assumingly on the Peninsula than it was on Cotai. ", ["It would certainly, I'm sorry.\nStephen Wynn\nI just said for example we closed the Macau the original 600 room tower for a period, you go ahead Ian.\nIan Coughlan\nSo it had a much bigger impact in Downtown Macau just because of the nature of Downtown Macau being the older part of the city that was less prepared and Cotai features a lot of new properties which didn't have as much damage as Downtown. We had a lot of services that were cut off Downtown. Clearly the focus was on taking care of residents and areas like the hospitals, et cetera, in terms of power supply and water supply. So we were affected Downtown, more off the image of Macau was affected for a period of time and that did affect bookings, we had tour groups that were essentially cut off from Macau for nearly two weeks, so we did see an impact. It's hard to quantify what it means in EBITDA terms but there definitely was a lull probably for two to three weeks."]], ["Ian maybe we could stick with the same kind of line of questioning but wanted to dig in a little bit more on the gaming operation side as you are key to ramp up Palace. ", ["Well taking mass first, the lift in mass will be in all segments of mass, and as a consequence of the growing market and all the initiatives I described earlier. On the junket side it's kind of a situation where the players within the junkets are demanding to come to Wynn and we're seeing the benefit of that and junket played roles as the property matures and gets older and people become more comfortable with it. Interestingly we had a lot of strong junket interest at Wynn Macau also where we have a couple of new junkets that are interested in joining us and we've got expansion of the existing junkets. So the junket world is very stable, the growth is very measured and we're getting the benefit of it being having two properties that cater to the higher end of the market."]], ["Good afternoon everyone, Steve you've been -- you had been after the tragic events in Las Vegas you know made some commentary about issues such as security and the like and I appreciate your comments that business is back to normal and so it seems as being present in the market at that point in time. ", ["Short answer is yes, I believe that the self consciousness about security has been continuous with all of the operators in Las Vegas for some time. Now the nature and the particular nuance of each of these companies' reactions to the threat, I'm not an expert on. I know what we did here because as one of my competitors described it, Wynn is paranoid and two years ago between Thanksgiving and Christmas we had a series of repeated consultations with consultants including Greg Kelly from New York, the people from SEAL Team, from the development group, SEAL Team 6 as they are known to some people, a lot of people came. We beat the bushes to find out everything that was -- that we could throw at this problem to harden this as a target. With the idea that someone was looking at the hotel, they would see that we had meet the threat level on a number of ways and they'd move on someplace else, because this would be a tough place to survive from more than 3 minutes if you had a gun on you.\nThat included every door, profiling, dog sniffers, all the stuff and it become operational in the 1st of May, the end of April of '16. Since then we invested all this money, it was close to 6 million or 7 million a year beyond our normal security. For payroll equipment and all kinds of -- without going into details, we did an awful lot of stuff that we never ever would have thought we would have to do. Because I personally felt that we were exposed. And that we should send a clear message that there was very little chance of being unnoticed in this building.\nNow having said that, we knew this particular fellow that did the shooting at Mandalay, he has been a customer here since '06, first started coming, we first picked him up on our records as a typical slot player with a modest credit limit of $50,000. And I got to interview -- and in the last three years been coming frequently with this lady companion of his and I interviewed -- I had a chance to interview the people in the high limit slot area, he plays video poker, he did. At a $20,000, $30,000 level and he never owed a dime. He had a $50,000 credit card. He doesn't owe a dime in Las Vegas. He played Mandalay and Caesars and here. He was a winner at Mandalay. He was a loser over the six or seven or eight years here.\nBut he never owed any money. He didn't meet the profile of a problem gambler or any like that. He was a very controlled person. And he and his lady ate dinner and played the poker with the slot machines in a high limit room before in the afternoon and they went to dinner tipped very well, went -- played after dinner, went to bed. They were served by people in this organization over a period of years and can only be described as the most vanilla, unexciting, totally typical couple that has ever walked in this building. When I interviewed the employees that knew them, they were stunned, mystified, that the person they knew could have been a person that tried to assassinate hundreds and thousands of people and succeeded in killing 58 of them. My employees were stunned.\nWe looked for and the police in [indiscernible] looking for a motive and can't find it. And it's a super fine kind of event. One of the young men that works for me outside the room Tyler Tracy took one in the shoulder and one in his back. Fortunately he's home and up on his feet, but he got shot twice. Both of the employees that were wounded are back are going to survive and be healthy and not have any long-term consequences. The industry is getting together. We're taking complete inventory of all the damage that was done to the people there. We want to separate minor injuries that were done as people ran, from people who actually took fire or got seriously trampled. The gaming industry is taking a complete inventory of what -- of the damage done to humanity and the people that have long-term disability and life changing problems, so that we can give some help to them that's real in long-term. And we're sort of operating as a group, some of us talking to one another like the Sands and MGM.\nAnd but, we have nothing to add to the explanation of why this maniac did what he did, other than he just had a screw loose that snapped or something. But is that -- what other hotels are doing, I am sure that in every executive suite up and down The Strip and in Reno and everywhere else and in hotels around the country, everybody is trying to figure out is there a way to use local parlance to lower the odds of a repeat. I know that even at the level we're operating on for past two years, Matt Maddox is sitting next to me, told me that yesterday he spent the afternoon in a discussion with some technology people that showed him an extraordinary thing that we could do that was unknown to us about what technology will allow in identifying without actually walking through a metal detector. But stuff they can identify what's on a person and identify where it is on a person on television. My guess is this sort of thing and vendors that sell this sort of equipment are going to a good investment if you're a stock bigger. Matt do you want to mention it?\nMatthew Maddox\nYeah, I think you're right. The technology is getting there and it's catching up. So I think that everybody will be looking to enhance security with better technology.\nStephen Wynn\nWe had a program for training our employees for two years; room service, housekeeping, audio-visual people that go and fix the TV or touch screen. They've all been trained for two years. They inspect the rooms, they look at the people. We profile everybody. We sniff the baggage in the baggage room. We don't interfere with people that have pull-along luggage when they come in, we just watch them and look at them and think about them. And if there is anything about them that meets our various criteria, they're immediately tagged and followed and observed. We have a whole routine that we do here that's transparent as far as a guest is concerned but highly articulated on our side. Now if you're a bad guy and you were looking at the vulnerability of this hotel, you'd probably spot a lot of the things that we're doing. And that's okay with us. It's all right if they see what we're doing in part. Maybe that's a good thing. But we don't flaunt it, it's just there."]], ["When we think about what that project can do in and of itself in terms of revenue and profits, apart from what it does in driving business to the property, against the existing property. ", ["The hotel that I described has 1,500 rooms, that's a complete -- it's not just a tower we're adding. It is a complete -- we're arguing about the final naming of it, as we speak but it is a complete destination hotel. It has spas, suites, restaurants, gaming, entertainment, showrooms, all that stuff and in addition it's on the water, on the boardwalk with all of that attraction and [its] things that I described that go from zip lines to a carnival parades and midway and convention facilities. The 1,500 rooms has its own convention component, in addition to the 450,000 foot building that's going on the Sands side and the 30,000 odd outdoor pavilion that's going on the Sands side. The hotel on the north side is a complete destination hotel, so it's a profit center unto itself, and of course it's connected very conveniently.\nIf you look at the -- and you will all know it when you see it, we have a tower on the north called Encore and a tower on the south called Wynn. The new tower is dead in the middle of them. If you were to walk down to showroom, walk down the hallway towards the Encore showroom and you go straight ahead you'd be right in the lobby. So this new tower, this new hotel is dead in the middle of the other two, and the whole 1,500 rooms is closer to our convention facilities than the two existing buildings are. But it has its own convention facilities, meeting rooms, ballroom, and the full complement of things you would expect to find if you're building a free standing hotel.\nSo it's a profit center. And the boardwalk and all of its attractions support all three buildings but also the residual real estate that is adjacent to the boardwalk, takes on an enormously enhanced value per acre and is very attractive. Imagine being able to develop on the boardwalk, on the water with its beach and its parades and water attractions and lake surfing and all the boating thing, imagine that and being directly across the street from the Las Vegas Convention Bureau. How good a location is that?\nOr how about being directly across the street from the Sands Expo Center? How about being directly across the street from the new forum that they're getting ready to build? We've been in meetings with the folks from Madison Square Garden, the Venetian and those folks have reached agreement. They're getting ready to start construction there. They're in the process of getting building and going through that sort of thing. This whole complex of ours is intensely surrounded by major attractions. That Madison Square Garden attraction is 18,000 theatrical seats, it's not another arena for hockey or basketball. It is Irving Azoff and Dolan's idea like the forum in LA as the major entertainment venue for Las Vegas. And that is directly across from us face to face on the street and we own the corner, we own both corners that surround the Madison Square Garden construction.\nSo all of this stuff is going to become very interactive, between now and 2020 and 2021, be a lot going on here. Not to mention the football stadium, not to mention the fact that finally it appears as if our resort world is going forward with the construction of their resort that was on the side of the former Stardust Hotel. I'm sure that someday something will happen on that frontier property across from us. Even though it sort of stumbled for the past several years, I would imagine that somebody will pick it up and do something constructive with it. It will be happy to hook-up with a bridge of they want to.\nSo I'm feeling really great about Las Vegas for the next 20 years. And my company intends -- my Board of Directors is committed to maximizing the non-casino touristic profile of this complex known Wynn in the next five years. We'll be in construction continually. A lot of this stuff will come on within the next 18, 19 months, hopefully. But there will be things happening in my view until 2021 sequentially. That's not to mention, if somebody shows up that wants to make a deal with us on some of our other property that is on the boardwalk. That too much information for everybody today?"]], ["Was just wondering after digesting these results, what your post mortem per property is, because as we are analyzing it, certainly, Wynn Macau you did beyond fantastic on the VIP side. ", ["I'm going to take that first. It's very important when you're looking at this industry, whether it's ourselves or our neighbors like MGM and Venetian. It's very important that you don't get caught up in the very short-term myopia that your professions demand in many respects, because it's the big things that determine the long-range viability of these places. And you know, the history of our company, it gives undeniable proof of that. When you build better facilities, when you invest in human resources, this is a business that remains viable and growing over a long period of time.\nSo, it's decisions that are not so much in the immediate analysis frame that matter. So when we look at the numbers that you're looking at to answer you directly. We say, the train is on schedule, the future of the company is being built intelligently with a strong foundation. And we take that as our principal responsibility. When you deal to the kind of customers that we deal to, when you deal at the level we do. In the gambling build room, which is only less than half of our business, there's volatility. But for example, in the last four days, Friday, Saturday and Sunday in this casino, just 10 or 15 international players contributed $12 million in a slow month. That's besides the full occupancy of the hotel and all the non-casino revenue and the slot machines and the race book and the poker.\nThe power of these enterprises are defined by their ability to answer the real issue with Las Vegas. Can you come to a destination resort and fulfill your expectations of living big and exciting experiential moments? Those kinds of moments take time to create, but once they are created, they endure.\nSo, you're talking to a group of men and women in this company \u2013 incidentally, we took \u2013 we did a count-up of all the most high-paid people in the company and 65% or 70% of them are women. When you talk to the group of ladies and gentlemen of Wynn Resorts, you will find a high level of consciousness of what we are about and what really defines our short-term and our long-term success. And these are sort of chewy, laden-with-detail conversations that define these big moments of experience.\nWynn has emerged, the Wynn Encore facility has emerged as the most celebrated hospitality installation in the world in terms of the awards and recognitions it receives for product and service. I don't say that in a braggadocios way. I mean all you got to do is look at Harvard Business Review, Fortune, Forbes Travel Guide, Barron's Magazine, Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller magazine. Every conceivable measurement of quality of product and service, we've managed to obtain a high level of success. And as we build these additional non-casino attractions, we have to do the same thing again and again. And you know that's pretty much our whole story. You have been listening to me for a long time, most of you. It never changes.\nThe way we define that challenge, the details of modernity, using technology, using social media and all the \u2013 this hotel is the first one that is all verbal. You can walk into our rooms and tell Alexa to turn on the lights, open and close the curtains, play The Eagles or Beyonc\u00e9 or Frank Sinatra. You can do all that. Change the temperature in the room. You can do it verbally.\nSo, we take advantage of technology. We try and stay ahead of the curve. We're told by the people at Facebook that we're the most advanced of all casino companies in our use of social media. Our Nightlife people, headed by Sean Christie and Alex Cordova, are up to their ears in the use of those techniques. So the tactics change, the overall strategy does not. Any of you folks want to add to that? I'm sort of...\nCraig S. Billings - Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nSure. Just in \u2013 I'm sure you can see it, but in terms of market share at Macau, because I think that's the question you're asking, what you see from first quarter to second quarter is we actually, in Macau in total, increased our market share in VIP, mass and slots, sequentially. Not going as fast as we had hoped 12 months ago, but the programs are in place and we feel good about the direction that we are going."]], ["If we could just kind of grill down to Wynn Palace and perhaps talk a little bit on the mass side and some of the programs that you have implemented there, given conversations throughout the quarter and even talk with things that you commented on last quarter, you know I would've \u2013 and I know the market on the mass side was down sequentially. ", ["The mass is really affected by the physicality of the neighborhood. I've said it so many times, I'm thinking I'm boring you, but mass has an awful lot to do with access. And I've laid out the obstacles we've faced. Incidentally, I mentioned the west, the south and north side of our property. I didn't mention the east. Well, that's under construction too because that's the service yard and the whole headquarters for the light rail system. We're literally surrounded on four sides by things that are under construction that will all add to our mass.\nOne of the reasons our mass numbers is so impressive downtown is because we're in the middle of everybody. Right now we're on the edge and surrounded by fences. We're on the edge of everybody. When we get surrounded again by SJM, by the monorail, by MGM and we have our connectivity, the picture's going to change dramatically.\nAnd if you go to Macau and you look at this firsthand, you'll grin and shake your head and you'll say, it's amazing this place does as well as it does. We've dealt with a severe handicap here. Now, when I say we dealt with a short-term severe handicap, we have an overwhelming advantage, and that is that we're in Macau to begin with. And Cotai as well and that's a privilege that long-term is sensational. Ian?\nIan Michael Coughlan - Wynn Macau Ltd.\nCan I make one point, Steve?\nStephen Alan Wynn - Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nSure.\nIan Michael Coughlan - Wynn Macau Ltd.\nSorry, Steve. One other severe handicap that we've had, particularly at premium mass level is the smoking issue where there are spaces in town that have been grandfathered in. They were formerly VIP and now they're being used for mass high limit. And people are allowed to smoke in them and are competitors. And that all goes away at the beginning of 2019, on January 1. Everybody has a level playing field. We will be the biggest beneficiary of that because we're operating handicapped right now."]], ["Maybe a way to ask this question in kind of a generic way, for you, Steve, then to give a high-level view, would appreciate your views is when you look at the Macau market now, say, where it was earlier in calendar 2017, and you look at where it is the now. ", ["Actually, Joe, I'm not the right guy to ask the question. I've had my nose down on work in the backyard here. Really. Ian or Craig? Either one of you guys want to take that? I'm not trying to slip the question, Joe, I'm just not up on that detail.\nIan Michael Coughlan - Wynn Macau Ltd.\nWe opened Wynn Palace with very strong VIP business, particularly in the junkets, and that strength has continued, and the remarkable aspect of everything is, we didn't cannibalize our business downtown at a VIP level in the junkets particularly. So that's been an area of strength. It continues to grow, sequential growth in junket business downtown has been significant three-quarters in a row. And we are built to take care of VIP customers at all levels, and our properties serve the VIP customers very well, we're known for that. So when that area of the business is growing, we do well.\nStephen Alan Wynn - Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nThe lack of cannibalization, I want to point out hastily, is again a reflection of when you build these places with a solid foundation, physically, programmatically and in terms of Human Resources, the notion of cannibalization doesn't really apply.\nCraig S. Billings - Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nAnd, Joe, I know the question you're trying to get to is what happened to mass in the second-quarter for the market? And I think that you know that in the second quarter it is seasonally slow for the market in June. So we are not going to sit here and predict which direction mass is going after 90 days. The business still feels good across our properties in both the premium segment and in the regular mass segment."]], ["And, Steve, when we look back on this three to five years from now, do you think we are going to be looking at a Palace property that is getting \u2013 that sees a much bigger ramp from here in the mass market, given some of the factors you mentioned? ", ["I think we'll look back and see Macau grow and prosper. With that growth will come concomitant growth in the mid and premium market levels as well as VIP. As the market gains traction and receives broader visitation in the Pacific Rim and from Mainland China and from everywhere else, Taiwan, Japan.\nAs the market grows, all those segments will beef up. You know it always happens sort of proportionately. Unless someone restricts a certain part like we had the restriction of the VIP then of course you see the relationships change. But under normal conditions, it proceeds pretty much pari passu. At least that's my take on it. I don't know. Matt, do you look at it differently?\nMatthew O. Maddox - Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nNo, no. I think you're right. One thing about Wynn Palace that we also haven't talked about is we are building some new amenities that are going to be great attractions for the mass market. They'll be opening next year. More restaurants are coming in the next nine months that are going to continue to add to that.\nStephen Alan Wynn - Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nFor Chinese New Year.\nMatthew O. Maddox - Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nYes.\nStephen Alan Wynn - Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nIncidentally, what Matt just said is true at each of our hotels all the time.\nMatthew O. Maddox - Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nThat's true.\nStephen Alan Wynn - Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nWe never leave any of them open. For example, in a week or so on the fourth of August, we redid the whole north end of Wynn Las Vegas where the Race Sports Book were \u2013 that were located and where a big casino bar and delicatessen are located. We closed the whole north end of Wynn, decided that we wanted to make it more exciting with new gorgeous screens, a brand new bar, new VIP seating sections for race and sports people. We've updated the restaurant and we're going to \u2013 this Friday morning, we're going to take the wall down and everybody is going to be dazzled because the entire north side of Wynn is going to look different than it did when we put the wall up the day after the final four.\nNone of these hotels stays the same in \u2013 we think of ourselves, if we're not growing, we're going backwards. If we're not adding new and exciting nuance to each of our properties, for our repeat visitors, then we are not keeping the promise that is the backbone of this corporation. So, what Matt just said about things are going to open between now and Chinese New Year, well that is going to be true in Las Vegas.\nAnd you be damn well sure that when Boston opens up, we will be tinkering with that. We buy more real estate so that we can grow Boston. We are buying up the neighborhood to make Everett a destination convention and entertainment element of the metropolitan area of Boston and central Massachusetts. We never leave these things alone. That's one of the reasons why we hold a higher percentage of fixed tables, and why our room rates stay high. So these places never get static. We don't allow that."]], ["When we think about the ramp up of the property, how much of the difference between what the property is doing now and what you think it can be doing when all is said and done? ", ["Interesting question, Robin. Got to think about that one. Wow. That's the kind of question I ask myself. Any of my colleagues want to help me out with this one? That's a very provocative question.\nIan Michael Coughlan - Wynn Macau Ltd.\nRobin, my take is, like we said last quarter, actually, the ramp is going to take us longer than what we told you guys at our Analyst Day last April. Those forecast are still what we project, but we need the infrastructure in place. Our programs are moving forward, and so we are big believers in that property and in Wynn Macau. But we have to get through really the next as we said, 2017 to see a lot of these things start to happen. So that is what we said last quarter and that's still how we feel.\nStephen Alan Wynn - Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nFor example, if they turn on those escalators, that's an item. You can't get across the street now. It's very tricky to understand that. We can look at the numbers from our neighbors and compare ours to them per table, I guess, Matt? And say, well, suppose that if we're less per table, I don't know? Are we? Than one of them? Will the number per table change?\nMatthew O. Maddox - Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nIt should. We are right at fair share right now, and our properties have always been 1.2 to 1.3 fair share, and so I believe that is where Palace is going to go.\nStephen Alan Wynn - Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nThere you go, Robin.\nMatthew O. Maddox - Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nIt has all of the elements in place.\nStephen Alan Wynn - Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nYes. If we are one to one on revenue versus \u2013 our percentage of the revenue versus our percentage of the equipment in the market. If we are one to one, that's the only time it has ever happened in my career in 50 years. In New Jersey we were 1.58, and the more hotels that opened, we increased the margin of excess margin over one to one. If so we are one to one Matt, right now, and the neighbors are one to two. We've always have been 1.2 and 1.3. Look at Wynn Macau. Then that would be a bare minimum, and that building, the Wynn Palace is the fanciest thing in China by far. So -"]], ["And years ago, maybe 6 to 8 years ago, I recall a rule of thumb that the government was fine with a 15+% , a growth rate around 15%, and I'm specifically referring to the VIP segment. ", ["The regulatory agency has tightened its controls and supervision of the junket operators. I think that's the form of expression that has been adopted and we don't know of any arbitrary number that is in government thinking on this subject. Only thing we do know is that they wanted to improve the standards of probity and investigative activity, and they have done that. And the main operators sailed right through, as they always have.\nI remember when we were being licensed to Massachusetts, the question was, well, Macau has a reputation that may be questionable in some quarters, especially in Massachusetts. And I remember that we said, wait a minute, let's put this matter to rest. We told each of our operators that, in addition to being licensed in Macau, they had to go to the organized crime criminal division of the Hong Kong Police Department and get certificates of clean bill of health certificates.\nThey actually would investigate someone and then come to a conclusion and make a statement in writing that that person was free of any criminal association. And every one of our operators went instantly and did it without hesitation. And that impressed the folks in Boston. We were happy to do it because we wouldn't want to do business with anybody that couldn't pass such an examination.\nSo, the regulatory issue is the one that I think is at stake here. I don't know that anybody has an arbitrary number about growth rates."]], ["Is there \u2013 maybe a different way of asking the question is, is it the fact that or \u2013 junket liquidity, do you think that that is maybe more of a relevant question versus government policy?

So looking at the premium mass portion at Wynn Macau it was really post opening of Wynn Palace about maintaining service levels and keeping the stickiness of the customers that we had downtown. And we've been very successful and doing that. And over at the Palace it was about continuing that slow steady build of premium mass players from a quite distinct market.\nAnd I have to say on both accounts it's being successful. The ramp-up period of Wynn Palace is not as quick as we'd like it to be. But it's been very steady. There is momentum. And on the premium mass side we continue to build new players for Wynn Palace.\nAnd as each weekend and each holiday period goes by, we pick up more people. We've done a lot of internal building of key host for the marketplace. And we are out there hunting for players and making them happy and keeping them."]], ["The Macau question is kind of similar to other folks has been asking about that when you look at the greater number of rooms that you have on Cotai versus Peninsula.

Ian and Ciaran, can you deal with Robin's question?\nIan Coughlan\nWe've got 700 more keys at Wynn Palace, and the waiting of casino rooms versus cash rooms is a lot lower than it is on the Peninsula. Downtown on the Peninsula it's been virtually impossible for 10 years to get a room in Wynn Macau, because it's been so heavily casino driven. Cotai is a slightly different market, but we have lots of room to grow casino customers and continue to hold high occupancy at Wynn Palace.\nWe've lifted occupancy at Wynn Palace from the low-70s in the third quarter to mid-90s in the first quarter of 2017. And there is quite a lot of activity in tour and travelling cash business, but we have lots of rooms with casino market. So as we gain momentum and continue to ramp up those rooms, we'll got to mid-tier and premium mass customers.\nCiaran Carruthers\nAnd when that happens, as soon as we straighten out the concession business, we'll add several thousand rooms to Cotai."]], ["I guess I'm wondering, as you look in this year and then you look out over like a five-year planning horizon \u2013 you guys have done a great job, as you say it, bending the cost curve and controlling costs to reduce regulatory lag.

As we give guidance, we do expect modest increases in O&M over the next year or two as we bring the wind onto the system, and we spend some money in very strategic areas like cyber and wildfire risk mitigations. Over the longer term, we expect to keep O&M flat, probably beyond the 2021 period. And that includes substantial cost curve bending as we absorb increases in salaries and bargaining unit increases and increases from suppliers, looking for upticks in our contracts and things like that. So it's a continuous effort, but I think the guidance for us is flat in 2022 and beyond to what is 2021."]], ["And then as you think towards the rate case in Minnesota, do you want to give any kind of premise as to how you think about that, again, obviously, being pushed out?

We \u2013 unless we can figure out a way to push it out another year, we'll file in November, with interim rates to go into effect in January of, I guess, that would be 2021. So I don't really have much more details than that. We were pleased to work with the staff and stay out. I think that allows us to focus on the resource plan, and it's nice to be able to take a little burden off the staff too as they've got quite a workload. So could we stay out another year? Well, I don't know. But I guess, I can't add much more color than that, Julien. That's where we are."]], ["Just from a constraint perspective in terms of whether it's rate case, I mean, rate impact to customers or balance sheet, et cetera, how much can you stretch that $22 billion if there were opportunities?

And where we can find those opportunities, if it's a PPA buyout, that's great, if; it's trading O&M for capital, that's great; if it's more steel for fuel, that saves customers money on their fuel bill, more than offsets the capital cost and the associated return, that's great. We're always going to be looking for that. And longer term, I think we're in the early days of beneficial electrification and saving customers' money on their total energy bill with EVs and other opportunities.\nSo I'm excited about the capital opportunities we have to invest.

", ["Yes. Well, Andy, I think that is a very good question. It's a challenging question because we're going to need natural gas to achieve that 80% carbon reduction that I mentioned. And early action is pretty darn important in addressing the risk of climate change. So we're going to get pushed back on natural gas. But I think the key is to make sure that people understand, you shouldn't make perfection be the enemy of a great plan.\nAnd we're moving away from coal completely here in the Upper Midwest. That's the plan. We're going to need gas to back it up. We had a \u2013 this time last year, we were on a polar vortex. Reliability is critical. So I think we've got a really pragmatic plan. Our challenge as an industry, Andy, is going to be making sure that people see that 2050 is a long way away. We're going to need different types of innovation. We'll put as much renewables and battery storage on the grid, but experts tell us that the big grid that we're all connected to does get saturated, depending on where you are in the country, between 50% and 70%.\nThat's amazing. That's the big grid. But that's where we're \u2013 but after that, we're going to need things to back it up and ultimately, new technologies. So as part of the leadership of EEI, that's a message I want to get out there. Now as far as the LDC goes and as far as using natural gas, I think our industry needs to be more demanding of upstream methane emissions. I think that's really important, and we can do something that. We need to double down on energy efficiency on the gas side. And then ultimately, I think we need to look at potentially using renewable gas or hydrogen made out of carbon-free energy and other things and start blending that in the resource mix.\nI will also tell you that here in the Upper Midwest, heat pumps and things like that are pretty tough to make work, at least with today's technology. So \u2013 and we've got of keep customers warm. So it's a challenging issue, but I think with the right messaging and demonstrating we've got a great plan, I think we can persevere there."]], ["It's not the regulatory compact so much it's just the regulatory \u2013 I mean you guys are going in all the time for rate increases or rate cases, if you follow me, and they're kind of \u2013 you seem to know more about it than I do, they can be kind of tactical and what have you.

I mean I think that working with the commission here, I thought that was a great example of partnership. And moving from must run to economic dispatch, I think that was a positive first step. The commission is very interested in understanding how a pause in coal dispatch could work as we start to ready for the day when we don't have any coal in the upper Midwest. So I think it's \u2013 the Midwestern way to kind of be pragmatic about how we approach this going forward.\nAnd to your point Paul, I think there are opportunities across our system to look at how we dispatch our coal plants particularly when you look at the variable costs of things like steel for fuel and renewable energy. So we're definitely looking at that down in the SPS region. We've got some water issues that we need to address, and that could be solved with some seasonal dispatch. So, again, with economics in mind, so \u2013 yeah, it does look for us \u2013 to look for more opportunities like we're doing here in the upper Midwest."]], ["And when you think about the range of potential outcomes in terms of things that might influence financial results like return on equity, how do you sort of flex for that when you think about the guidance range?

First of all, we are very much aligned with our commissions on what we are doing with the clean energy transition. It's good to have their support with that. I think second of all, if you think about it, we certainly don't have above market ROEs today. And then finally, if you look at some data points on some of the cases that we have decided recently, they kind of point to a reasonable ROE. So we always know we don't everything we ask for, of course.

", ["Well, Angie, I have to tell you, I think we have the most transparent growth of our organic system which is the $22 billion that we put forth and we think even beyond the forecast period, we will continue to see excellent opportunities to grow the system. We are create headroom with things like Steel for Fuel to keep bills low so that we can make those investments and not overburden customers. I think that's a very important consideration. The PPA buyout strategies which is pure upside to a very robust base capital plan. And this is not a strategic change. You are not going to see us look for opportunities to come in as a financial investor. This is situation where we had some modeling differences on the benefits. Bob mentioned, we have two other wind proposals in front of the commission. The difference there is, these benefits are very much front-end loaded. And I think there is a preference in Minnesota to own renewables over gas. So we will see where that goes. But again, I think we are quite proud of the pure play vertically integrated regulated utility we are."]], ["And then just on the Colorado case, I think the settlement timeline is really in the next like week or two and it sounds like you can't really talk about whether you are going to be able to settle or not.

If I had something definitive to report, I would.

Commission decision is expected in December and new rates in January. So the timeline is relatively compressed anyway in terms of when we go from hearing to final rates. So the clock itself is not a driver."]], ["And then I wonder if you could talk both on a holistic basis across the industry and then also what you guys are seeing in terms of the PTCs, how those and ITC for the solar parts in that 2022 to 2024 time period? ", ["Well, that's a great question. It's one of the reasons why we accelerated and really put the pedal down on our Steel for Fuel program and the biggest wind expansion in the country that we have now because we did want to lock in those PTC credits before they expired at the 100% level and even at the 80% level. You are right. I think the wind industry will take a little time to adjust quite frankly, Travis, when the PTCs roll-off. Of course, there is a chance they won't.\nOur approach to the solar piece of this is that I think the cost curve on solar continues to decline pretty quickly. And so we think that even the absence of the roll-off of ITC or most of it anyway will be more than offset by just gains in the solar itself and we think that times of very, very nicely to the retirement of our coal plants in the mid-2020. So we don't see a need to go out and lock anything in because we think the cost curve will more than offset the ITC reduction. And again, we will clearly wait to see if there is legislation, et cetera might change that."]], ["And we have recently had FERC put out an order and some comments as well, I guess, from certain commissioners about the FERC Order 1000 really hasn't worked out as they thought it would in terms of providing the level of competition that they wanted to.

I don't think the barrier to getting transmission done, which is really what we are trying to get accomplished, is not about the competitive process In fact, if you look at the biggest transmission build, it was done with CapEx 2020, as I mentioned. And that was utilities of all sizes and municipalities and co-ops coming together to form a plan that works with an idea of how cost would be allocated because the real barriers to getting transmission build is, who pays for it and then of course the permitting and everything else that goes with that.\nSo I think my personal opinion, Paul, is that FERC 1000 and that whole process really clouds it and it's not necessary and we will see where that goes. But as I mentioned, as you know, we have got a right of first refusal in Minnesota. We have it in other jurisdictions. We are not an RTO in Colorado. I think there is some real advantages to that. But we will get this transmission built. And we are being realistic in the time it takes to get it built."]], ["As you look forward kind of in the next 10 years, once coal essentially comes out of texture for you, guys, are we in an environment where it's gas versus renewables, or the that solar or wind, but is that the offset?

I mentioned, we will be completely out of coal in the Midwest. Still have some coal after that on our system, so there'd be more transitioning. I think gas and renewables and the extension of niche will make all the sense on how we continue on that path to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. I don't think they really compete with each other. They're going to -- they'll support each other at that point. Of course, we'll also be looking at the role batteries can play on our grid, the role batteries can play with storage. I think it'll be even more important to have demand response-type programs. And of course, we're very excited about EVs and what that might mean to our system and the interactions -- new interactions that can create with our customers."]], ["I'm just wondering, since you guys are sort of big on this stuff, what you're seeing and how you see the economics of that developing sort of beat this -- or cheaper than a peaker, that kind of thing. ", ["So great question, and we are seeing some very attractive bids, and you mentioned the 275-megawatt battery project. That's associated with the solar asset, and it's associated with the solar asset, Paul, because you want -- because that allows for the 30% ITC to be recognized. And I did put it on parity with peakers. I think batteries will continue to fall on price just like I think renewables will continue to fall on price and over time overcome the roll-off of the tax benefits. And yes, storage can be the new peakers but only to a certain degree of penetration and saturation. I mean because, as you know, we need to plan for much more than a 4-hour, even an 8-hour event. So I think the initial tranches of batteries are very viable and you planning basis, you give them equal weight as you would with a traditional CT peaker. But the more penetration you have in batteries, the more you shave off of that very peak load, you start to lose some of the planning value of batteries. And not to get too technical on you, but we're aware of that. Of course, batteries will have other roles on the grid, including supporting the grid reliability, and we're looking at those alternatives. And all of that will be baked into our plans as we move forward. But you cannot replace all peaking needs with batteries. That's very clear.\nRobert Frenzel\nPaul, one thing I'd add on to Ben's comments is we did do a broad solicitation for the Colorado Energy Plan. We published the results of that solicitation with averages, and we published the solar-only and a solar-plus storage average. I don't have the numbers at my fingertips. But if you want more details on what we saw about 18 months ago on the solicitation, we can share that with you. Obviously, the markets move for both solar and for storage assets, and we continue to see price declines in both of those asset classes. But I think that those midpoints will highlight to you how competitive some of that stuff is becoming over time."]], ["I just wanted to ask about the update you gave on O&M, which obviously -- I think you've been saying you expected to go back to 2017 levels, now you're saying just down 2%.

We continue to take out costs out of our business smartly. But, we're reinvesting some of those cost savings into things that I think are really important for our customers, and improving the customer experience as part of that, reducing systematic risk in areas of cybersecurity, gas safety, proactively implementing best practices for wildfire risk. I think, these are things that are important. And we're putting a little more money in that than we originally planned. When we look ahead to 2019 -- or rather 2020, I think, you can expect us to keep O&M relatively flat with where we end up in 2019."]], ["And my last question, can you just, I guess, give a little more detail as you mentioned your electric load growth weather normalized with north of 1% this \u2013 in 2018, which you are assuming flat growth in 2019.

We think that year-over-year we have a couple of discrete instances where we know we have a lower demand from some of those C&I customers and we don't expect as aggressive growth in the oil and gas industries we saw in 2018. Obviously, if we had upside as Ben mentioned to the sales growth in some of our expectations, if we exceeded the flat forecast, it would obviously be upside for 2019 earnings."]], ["And now given what we're witnessing in California now with this whole discussion about how expensive renewable power PPAs has inflated customer bills.\nI'm just wondering if you can give us a sense, for instance, if there is any kind of a rule of thumb, what kind of CapEx opportunity do you see as these PPAs roll off.

They're behind us and approved. And as I said in my prepared remarks, if you look at our history, Julien, those outer years always get filled in. And I think if you go back, for example like to 2014 and look what we were forecasting in that 2017 to 2019 period of time, we were looking to about $2.8 billion average annual on those three years periods. And in fact, we are spending more like $4 billion.

We still have 4.4 gigawatts of coal on our system. I'm really excited, Julien, about customer-driven programs, like I mentioned, Renewable Connect. We're just now starting to develop more customized programs to allow customers to have EVs and other customized products. I think it's going to open up a whole new world for us.

It's something that we're always looking at and what I'm pleased to tell you is that while rate base is growing at 6-plus-percent in this timeframe and I think it will continue to grow at those kinds of rates going forward, the key is not to have that translate for the need for a corresponding rate increases to our customers.\nSo if you look at our cost where we've been since 2013 on a total bill basis, our bills have actually fallen, that's lower commodity prices, that's the beginning days of steel for fuel, that's energy efficiency, and our own cost initiatives to keep rates low. If we look at the forecast time period, we don't think rates will go up any more than 1% to 2% on that timeframe. So that creates that headroom potentially for additional investments that I think are closely aligned with customer wants and expectation.\nSo it's a really important thing, you've got to keep your eye on the ball. I don't think you can ask for more than CPI-type rate increases with and have success. And that's the beauty of steel for fuel and turning fuel into investment opportunities and et cetera.

S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.\nSo, Paul, I think you're also asking if we're making those recommendations, as Bob mentioned. But I think you're asking would we change our equity plans? The answer is the equity plans are what we share with the rating agencies and we don't anticipate changing those. What we hope is that our commissions follow our guidance, so that the credit ratings would be preserved."]], ["Just as you look at the cash flows, I didn't really see it in the handout, but, I guess, as the wind comes on, you get into a negative tax rate situation, I think in like 2021 or something like that.

So that wasn't a unanimous decision by the Commission to bring it down to 9.35%. And as Bob said on his prepared remarks, we're disappointed with that. We run a top quartile utility in terms of cost, reliability and safety. And I think as everybody knows that takes investment and that's exactly what we're trying to do in Colorado and other jurisdictions.\nAnd long-term, you need good constructive regulatory outcomes to continue to be a top quartile utility, which is what we want to be. So that was a disappointment. But Ali, the treasury rates continue to rise and I think we'll have to have continued dialogue with our Commissions about the need for \u2013 that ROE does matter in our business. So what it tells me we need to do is we need to be more persuasive and communicate better the importance of good regulatory outcomes to achieve the kind of results that I think our customers really appreciate and benefit from.\nRobert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.\nI think I'll just add a thing to that, Ali, which is as part of the gas case, we did agree to defer the TCJA impact to a separate proceeding and we've got another opportunity to work with the Commission and the staff on the impact of tax reform on our credit in Colorado. And so, we have another opportunity, and our proposal is to raise that equity ratio to 57% and we'll do that in that follow-on tax proceeding."]], ["So maybe, if I can, can I follow-up on Ali's questions a little bit on the Colorado case and just if you can expand on your thoughts as to the implications to the electric case specifically on a multi-year and forward-looking terms and perhaps elaborating on what alternatives or mitigation plans.

So I don't think we're breaking new ground if we choose to file a multi-year plan.\nI also would say, I mean, I think we've got opportunities to move that ROE up. And if you look at, I think, the perception of the Commission on ROE, they tend to think that the gas side of the business can get by, if you will, don't necessarily agree with, but get by with a lower ROE.

Those are ongoing and I do think that over time, I think the trend that the Commission would like to see is the equity ratio to come down mildly, but I don't think I'd be concerned. I think we've been pacing it for the past five years or six years, but I do think we've taken a pause with regard to tax reform and we do believe in our recommendation to the Commission and the Staff 57% is actually the right number to be at for, for the time being."]], ["Is that something where we should be concerned about longer term that, I know you talked about the gas to equity ratio may be going up to 57% because of the tax reform?

I mean it wouldn't be favorable for it, but we've got other things that \u2013 other levers to pull.\nSo as you know, Andy, because you pushed us many times to raise that long-term growth rate, we don't plan for a perfect performance and everything when we put out projections. We like to run a conservative company. We do that in almost every aspect of the business, how we run the systems, how we plan for the systems, having margin in your credit accounts, making sure we have lines of credits that are always available.

When you look back at our electric case that we'd filed previously and some of the guidance and some of issues that were heard from the Commission, there was a real desire for us to file both a revenue case as well as a rate design case.

We've got rider and revenue recovery associated with the Rush Creek assets that will go in service in October or November this year. And we have tax reform out there. And so, those three large considerations, factor in to how we want to approach our next rate case with the Commission. We want to satisfy their request, which is revenue and rate design, but there are some complications and we're trying to resolve some of them in advance of the rate case."]], ["And last question, when I look at the earned ROE over the last 12-month period that you report at the OpCo level, it looks like the regulatory lag right now was (00:23:14) about 40, 45 basis points.

I mean, to Bob's point, Ali, it gets a little harder to close the remaining gap. There's the structural things and that sort of stuff. But, I mean, so as Bob mentioned, longer term regulatory compacts, I think we're doing a great job of finding cost efficiencies. Those all will contribute to it, but we've pretty much achieved the goal at this point."]], ["We've seen some more extreme intervener positions of late on ROE and other factors, maybe a little bit of inconsistency in commission rulings for some of your peers, and you're coming up on the end of your multi-year plan at the end of 2019.

Our cases increasingly would be for capital recovery, done a really good job with O&M.

We've had a lot of constructive dialogues across almost all of our jurisdictions at this point, particularly the ones where we've got pending rate cases with Texas, New Mexico and the two cases in Colorado. I think the regulators and the stakeholders in all those cases are contemplating the impacts of tax reform either as parts of those cases or as adjuncts to those cases.\nSo, I don't think it impacts the timing or the estimate of our rate case revenues that we're expecting in either 2018 or 2019. I guess the one consideration I'd say there is our filed case or our filed testimony in South Dakota contemplates potentially we're under-earning in South Dakota and it contemplates potentially not filing a rate case as part of tax reform."]], ["If I remember correctly last year when you started to have success on the Minnesota renewable front then you were kind of discussing the impact on your overall rate base growth and CapEx plan, you deferred some other spending at least hypothetically to limit the positive impact there.

We could - I think when I made those comments that you referred to, it's really about how much great investment you do and while those great investments are credibly beneficial to our customers that does come with a price tag, so we want to be very mindful of that. But we have other capital we could bring forward or other opportunities that we could seek, I mean look at the deal - the Dakota Range budget as an example of that.

", ["Yeah, Jon, it's Bob. I don't think we made any direct consideration on tax reform with respect to turning on the DRIP. If you remember the share repurchase program was initiated when the capital environment was you know 4ish billion dollars less than it is today. So with consideration for credit and everything else, I think we wanted to make sure that we had a very conservative plan that maintained our credit rating and a modest amount of DRIP equity annually was enough in our opinion to maintain that profile.\nWhen you ask about when do you turn it back off, I think it just depends on what the future capital profile and opportunities for investment for the company. We see a long runway for capital investment at this rate and so at this point, we would consider keeping it on including\u2026"]], ["So just looking at you know Midwestern utilities pushing more renewables in the rate base, I mean I understand the energy aspect of the appeal of these investment, but we're starting to see first indications that intervene want some offset to the existing generation capacity because these assets do have some megawatts as well as the energy component. ", ["Well, I can't speak for all of the Midwest utilities but speaking for itself, I think we've done a very good job of developing comprehensive plans that when we do talk about shutting down plants and for example in Minnesota, one and two units that we get the recovery associated with that shutdown. And in fact Angie if you look at what we're talking about in Colorado, we contemplate accelerating the depreciation of the Comanche one and two plants through a what's known as the reason mechanism, so that is taken care of and the cost of all of that and both of those plans still comes in at a price that's great for consumers. So we definitely look at that risk and we address it in the plans that we put forward to our stakeholders."]], ["And last question, as you look at these CapEx spending opportunities, and I know you'll scrub it all out and give it to us in Q3, but clearly, the bias is towards more spending in renewable.

I think the Minnesota Commission is comfortable, if we can bring them good projects to even do more. Still going to get the approval down at SPS. It's a big part of that CapEx upside. So all those things happen, I think we're pushing towards the upper end of our range, and we don't have to issue equity. I think that's important to note. I mean, there's some debt that goes with that, but we don't have to issue equity. So I think we're well-positioned to be at the top of that 4% to 6% guidance range, particularly for this forecast period, but we haven't changed the long-term growth rate at this point."]], ["And at the very least, you could get recovery of those projects through a general rate case filing, but you would also consider asking for some kind of rider mechanism to get them. ", ["Yes, sure, we can do that. Let me just say, I think, it's going to be more like the first quarter of 2018 for the final approval. We're on the ground, getting a lot of community support, legislative support. I think these projects are very popular for their obvious economic benefits. So this is about a $1.6 billion spend. I believe that increases our rate base and SPS by about 40%. As we know, we've suffered from some pretty significant lag at SPS. So our proposal is that we need concurrent recovery. The benefits are going to flow immediately to our customers. They're going to be significant. We need to get immediate recovery. And I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll get that, and we're going to need to get that. I mean, this is too big of an investment to put into place and suffer the historic lag we typically have. So that's what it's all about and that's what we're working on right now."]], ["I was wondering, as you add all these wind farms on and all the capacity here, kind of a follow up to Paul's question, what additional investment do you need that might not already be anticipated? ", ["Yeah. Well, listen, let me take this two ways, I'll answer your question directly. When we price out the economics of these wind farms, we assume any kind of incremental ancillary costs that might be occurred, and I think we do a very good job of realistically looking at that, the additional transmission build-out, et cetera, Travis. Wind is fuel, and hence Steel for Fuel. And I do think that opens up the opportunity to have dialogues with our key stakeholders around the retirement of some of our fossil plants, principally, coal plants. And if you look forward, I think what that does for us is the opportunity to do more Steel for Fuel, and more steel, frankly, as we get beyond this forecast period. I mentioned in my remarks that Governor Hickenlooper issued an executive order in Colorado. I think that's going to create another wave of opportunities for us to add more renewables to the system as we start to look at the potential retirements of some coal plants. But again, this tranche of renewables wind, we can integrate into our system with some ancillary costs, which are baked into the LCOEs that we're quoting to our commissions."]], ["So as it's obvious, you're trending very easily towards, I think you said, and obviously some other callers, I think it was Ali, towards the high end of your 4% to 6% growth rate, I guess it's somewhat, I don't want to say, in the bag. ", ["Well, we'll continue to look at it, and I'm pleased with the progress we've made. We've got some more things to do, Andy. We don't have the SPS wind deals approved. We got to watch and see how some of the rate cases, that Bob mentioned, proceed. So I mean, there are still some moving pieces. I'm comfortable letting you know that we're trending towards the top of that range, and that's what our goal is going to be. And as I said before, so I can't really add anything new to it, we'll continue to look and evaluate what we think our long-term growth rate is. I do agree with you that the actions we've taken and the success we've had so far would probably indicate that there's certainly much more opportunity to hit the 6% than there is risk that will only be at 4%. I hope people can be comfortable with that."]], ["And then just more of an industry question because kind of looking at what you guys are doing, and then obviously the big AEP announcement as well, and again, just thoughts on a very high level. ", ["Well, Andy, I guess, I would look at it this way. I mean, I think the overall pie is getting bigger. As renewables compete directly and win on economics versus the more traditional fossil alternative, that's means we're going to have a lot more renewables on the system. And we certainly are, and when I look forward to 2030, we're going to continue to advance smart renewables, large-scale renewables that save customers money. Now, how that happens? I think that depends.\nI do think NextEra is well-positioned. I mean, they do a good job. There's others that do a good job. But if you notice, even in the megawatts that we're going to own in this \u2013 what we talked about with wind, they're some significant component of build-own-transfer. And so I think you're going to see more and more of that from all developers where this is a prime time type of asset to own, and I think utilities are going to want to own these assets, and they're going to be looking to either self build as we've done or contract with developers to own those once they are getting ready to go into service under a build-own-transfer concept. So I think you will see less PPAs. But if the overall pie increases, I'm not sure everybody doesn't have a chance to participate in the market, at least the good ones."]], ["You said early days of what we can accomplish, I think.\nI take that to mean that you have confidence in addressing that 50 to 60 basis points of ROE gap on a trailing basis here. ", ["Well, it's kind of all of the above, Julien. Our vision is to continue to decarbonize and do so in a way that allows us to save customers money, which sets up the dialogue, can you stay out of rate cases. And I think there's more to come on that.\nI think what we're seeing in our early efforts and initiatives to really focus on cost, I mean, it makes us confident that we can keep O&M flat. Can we do more? Well, we'll see. But I think it positions us very well going forward to manage the company.\nAnd part of that successful management will be to close that gap between what we actually earn and what we're authorized to earn. And I want to make it clear that there's always going to be some structural limitations there. I mean, things that our regulators don't allow us to recover, for example, executive comp, which is very important. Not to be too silly.\nBut we'll continue to work towards closing that, as Bob mentioned, off of an average 9.6% and I think you'll continue to see us make progress."]], ["So those projects that you went through and listed at the beginning, are there any in there or are they all incremental to what you've previously announced and what was in the CapEx plan? ", ["Take that, Bob?\nRobert C. Frenzel - Xcel Energy, Inc.\nYeah. Sure. So what we discussed today was the totality of the newbuilds in each of our jurisdictions. Ben mentioned Rush Creek, that's been previously in our capital plan and was approved by the Colorado Commission, and it's under construction.\nWe announced new wind in our Upper Midwest system, 1,550 megawatts, 750 megawatts of self-build, 400 megawatts of build transfer and 400 megawatts of PPAs. I think what was new was probably the 400 megawatts of the self-build proposal, which, as Ben indicated, could be somewhere around $700 million of capital if all of our projects were approved, in addition to the original capital program.\nAnd then, obviously in the Southwest, at our SPS Company, we had a 1,000 megawatts of self-build and 200 megawatts of PPAs. And I think all of that 1,000 megawatts of self-build is included in our capital estimates that we talked about back at EEI.\nBenjamin G. S. Fowke - Xcel Energy, Inc.\nYeah. So, Travis, maybe the way to think about it is, we were quite confident when we put that placeholder out for $3.5 billion that we would be able to find those steel-for-fuel opportunities and as Bob mentioned, for example, the self-build opportunities in the SPS jurisdictions, et cetera. But what we have found is that some of the bids were so compelling, and particularly some of the build-own-transfer bids, that not only did we fill our estimate of the $3.5 billion, but we've actually exceeded it with what is now on the table."]], ["John, on the HP acquisition, you touched on this in your prepared remarks, but I\u2019m wondering if you could dig a little bit deeper into what you see as the biggest benefits of industry consolidation?

So, our confidence in the $2 billion is quite high that we can hit that.\nAnd if you look at our team and our track record of what we\u2019ve done with Project Own It here, we delivered $1 billion over the last 18 months, and we\u2019re on track to deliver the $450 million plus in 2020.

In 2020, we\u2019re expecting really minimal impact from inorganic. As you know, last year we did approximately $40 million of tuck in acquisitions, we\u2019ve guided towards $100 million this year, but we\u2019re expecting little impact.

With that said, it\u2019s hard to say what would have been exactly without versus the installs being down 12%. But certainly I think without any impact, we would have expected it to be more in the mid-single digits, down and worse, but we clearly saw improvement in XBS in June.

You also have some of the deals over in Europe that were delayed that we expect to close into the second half that will also help improve the mid-range area."]], ["It sounds like there were some sale cycle delays in 2Q that clearly could continue into the back half, so that you are able to close the deals that delayed, there could be continued delays in 3Q and 4Q.

We know the changes that we made from Project Own It respective are good for the company for the long term, but still adjusting to those changes in the short term had some impact and we\u2019re confident that XBS can get back to levels of recent quarters prior to the first two quarters of this year.\nAs far as the delay deals, there is some \u2013 we are expecting some of those to close in the second half, it will have some favorable impact, I would say the bigger impact is really coming from the better responsiveness to the organizational impacts of Project Own It on the XBS side."]], ["Bill just wanted to start off, wonder if you could help us bridge the EPS guidance just between expected underlying operational improvement for the balance of the year versus the Q1 upside that you saw particularly given the contribution from Fuji Xerox, and I know previously you hadn't included share repurchases in your full-year expectations.

First of all as John and I stated on the call, we're very pleased with the progress of Project Own It and what it's doing for us from a performance \u2013 operational performance perspective. And just if you look at the first quarter, we are up 140 basis points and adjusted operating margin year-over-year. So obviously, we're comfortable with reiterating our guidance of 100 to 150 basis points.\nBut with that said, we also said in the prepared remarks that we are \u2013 we have planned for investments during the year, we said during the Investor Day and during fourth quarter earnings call $0.32 and we're continuing with those and we're looking to based on Q1 results to increase those throughout the year.\nSo the components are you hit on them a little bit from the share repurchase, the original guidance assumed more towards the latter part of the year. As you saw, we purchased a little over $100 million in Q1 and so that will have more of an effect that was originally anticipated. And then we added sort of $300 million which will be, as we go throughout the year we\u2019ll have to work through the first remaining 200, the first 300 and then the second 300 be the latter part of the year.\nSo both those will be positive and then you know, as I mentioned on the comments also the Fuji Xerox, we expect to be less of a year-over-year favorable effect. They had some one-time accounting items in the prior year, but it really is a combination of the timing of the share repurchases and the benefits from Project Own It."]], ["And then on post sale you spent some time on this in the prepared remarks, but just wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper into what's driving some of the weakness that you're seeing. ", ["Yes. So in post sale, you will allow our post sale is bundled as we've talked about over a 80% of our post sale is related to bundled contracts and we saw the underlying page volumes being consistent with some prior quarters which drives a lot of that bundled post sale, but there is a portion that is more transactional in nature and can be \u2013 won't be specifically unbundled supplies in the developing markets. We had strong Q4 and it was not as strong as in Q1. We do expect that is a timing issue and we do expect to see that come back.\nAnother part of the post sale, that's more transactional in nature is paper. It's not a high-margin area, but it's in the developing markets, we still sold paper in particular Mexico was down year-over-year. That may not come back as much, but it is a low-margin items. And then the other item to call out from the transactional perspective and post sale is the IT hardware reselling which several of our XBS course do and that can be lumpy and the year-over-year there that was a decline in Q1, but we do have line of sight to specific transaction in Q2 and Q3 that we will improve that.\nBut overall, as I said in my comments that we look throughout the year. We're confident based upon our updated forecast, the revenue, constant currency decline that Q1 7% will be the worst and will be improving throughout the remainder year, sequentially each quarter will be better than the next.\nJennifer Horsley\nThanks, Matt."]], ["So John, Bill you sound pretty confident that you have your arms around sort of what led the revenue weakness in the areas in which they were softer during the March quarter.

We reduce layers, we increased spend, we reconfigured our go-to-market, we split DMO between the Americas, we transfer 28,000 accounts from U.S. enterprise XBS, we consolidated our real estate.\nSo we think of everything we talked about, we optimized our workforce and while we don't ever want to minimize the risk of disruption that created by all these changes, but in each case we made these changes because we know what's best for Xerox in the long-term.\nI personally met with over 300 of our managers and I can tell you that while there was some disruption they are all excited about the future because we are investing in the long-term. You've heard me talk a little bit about the areas we're investing in which is in the service of the software, our equipment, our security, the summit we\u2019ve had and in the future and innovation.\nSo while we knew that this was going to cost some disruption in execution in the early part of the year.

Just to deal with software sales that we didn't have before we have specific targeted programs in the A4 and A3 areas specific targeted marketing programs in those areas and in the eCommerce area.\nWe're expanding, what we're doing there and we have an SMB attack plan.

We were downgraded towards the end of the year, not because of the state of our balance sheet but because our requirement of our topline being at least flat to growth, but we currently \u2013 with investment grade.\nWe have a goal of getting back as a company to investment grade, our store actions have been those of supporting a strong balance sheet, we paid down debt.

But the complexity of the business is greater than I thought. So part of what we're doing in cost opportunities is we're looking at it in an operational way.\nLet me give you just an example. If you're looking at manufacturing a box for a client, you need to look at it end-to-end from the manufacturing, what the costs are, to the development of it, to what's the value to the client and how do you maintain it and how you ship it.\nAnd something as simple as if you can manufacture and ship a box under 45 pounds, you only need one person to deliver that box versus having two people delivering it. So when we're looking at optimizing the business, we need to look at things differently.\nToday, as an example, we have 1,400 IT applications to support our business. How do we simplify that? How do we take resources that manage all these systems and put it into an end-to-end solution? And our job is to identify all these issues in our processes, so we can drive a clear end-to-end accountability for decision-making and financial performance."]], ["I think it really helps preferencerize (43:07) the risks for us to understand the opportunities better.\nThat said, obviously, there is a ton of action points falling out of your assessment already and I'm sure you're going to bring it all together into some kind of program that you'll disclose at the Analyst Day event.

There has always been a focus on working capital within the company. I would tell you with John coming onboard that there has been even more. John said in his comments, maniacal focus on cash. I would view it in terms of that we're comfortable with the cash flow guidance that we provided originally, that we're reiterating, that we provided originally in January.\nAs far as working capital pillars, days sales outstanding, days sales in inventory, days payable outstanding, we're working to improve all of those significantly even though (53:27) we had originally planned that. It's just that the need to actually \u2013 those will make it even better I guess, I would view it from a cash flows perspective that if you look at where we're at year-to-date on cash flows, we're already at $400 million of free cash flow year-to-date. And seasonally, Q4 is the strongest, that improvements in working capital, additional improvements will only help us and give us upside. It's really my perspective on that.\nFrom an MDS perspective, don't like to start going to the months, as we get to the lumpiness, it can be even lumpier within months, within a quarter. With that said, overall MDS was up 2.3%. MDS revenues 2.3% in constant currency, driven by a significant improvement in ESR, equipment sales revenue, in Q2 within MDS.\nThe channels or the SMB part of the business continues to be strong, it's growing double-digits again and up 14.4% in MDS revenues. And enterprise still continues to be \u2013 it's a more competitive, more mature market, it was down about 1% in revenues for the quarter. So overall, we view ourselves as the market leader in MDS and we expect to continue to be that. The two larger deals we lost during the quarter, we're not happy about but overall for the longer-term we're still expecting to be strong in MDS."]], ["So with that then, can you talk a bit about, as we look at the company over the next couple of years, you've laid out synergies, but how are you thinking about, first, how the company is going to operate together?

The cost synergies drive tremendous value that you delineated in the question you gave. What I really like about this is when you go through integration, people worry about the integration complexity. What we're doing now is we get to participate in growing markets. So Xerox participated in about an $85 billion market that was declining at about 3%. We now have access through Fuji Xerox to a $36 billion market that's growing at 2%, with very large shares in China, Asia Pacific and Japan. And the beauty is we don't have to worry too much about complexity of integration or go-to-market because the go-to-markets for the most part will stay exactly as they are. What I get really excited about is when I look at the innovation and getting into the new markets by combining technologies.\nOne of the things in unlocking the value is we tended to have duplicative R&D. And now we're going to be able to divide and conquer. We'll be able to take the 6,500 engineers that this combined company has, that produces about 1,500 patents a year over the last few years and accelerate innovation in the areas of industrial print, which is a $100 billion market that is untapped for us today. You know the packaging market very well, flexographic corrugated labels, folding carton, that's still very much an analog market that's not digital.

", ["Yes. So Q4 was the first impact that you had seen. Admittedly, it was coming off of a Q4 2016, if I remember, was down about 10%, a little bit of an easier compare. When we get to Q1, what you'll see is we were down about 5.7% at constant currency Q1 2017, compares now to these, we'll get into some relatively easier compares in Q2 and Q3. Q2 2017, we're down 14.6% at constant currency. And then Q3, we were down again double digit, but the thing is people ask all the time, is this something where you'll get four-quarter or five-quarter of benefit out of it? And one of the things -- we will get the normal four-quarter or five-quarter of benefit out of the new products, but the multi-brand expansion strategy is the thing that will prolong this for a while. And the reason I say that is I keep coming back to this $15 billion multi-brand reseller market that we really never participated in.\nWe only had about 1% market share. And as we can continue to grow the number of multi-brand reseller partners there, every share point is worth about $150 million. I'll also mention that as a result of the transaction, as we're going through best practices with Fuji Xerox, they have a similar, similar issue from the past where they haven't focused on multi-brand resellers. And it's an area that they're going to explore, too, which is part of the beauty of bringing these 2 companies together is comparing the best practices. As I mentioned before, their market shares in Asia are much higher than our market share. We're going to adopt their best practices as well.\nWilliam Osbourn\nJust a follow-on to Jeff's comments, Jim, just we gave full year guidance in the regular earnings materials that we believe is very strong full year guidance. But just we've historically given -- look, we don't give quarterly guidance, but we give sort of expectations. And just from a revenue perspective at constant currency, we said full year down 2% to 4%. We would expect, just given it is a more challenging compare, as Jeff said, Q4 was a good -- I mean, Q1 last year was a good quarter, we'd expect to be near the lower end of that 2% to 4% on the full year guidance in the first quarter. And as far as our adjusted operating profit margin, our 13% to 14% in the full year is due to seasonality that we expect to be slightly below the low end of that range, but are fully confident in being within the full year range of 13% to 14%. As far as adjusted EPS, historically, we gave -- well, we gave guidance for next year of $3.50 to $3.70, $3.60 being the midpoint. And historically, the first quarter has typically been about 18% to 20% of the total, just to give people some guidelines what we're expecting in Q1."]], ["But if we think about what the one-timers were this year versus what we will see next year, the fact that you sort of raised your operational cash flow guidance and reduced your CapEx for this year, just how should we think about the trajectory of cash flow for next year? ", ["Hey, Shannon. It's Bill Osborne. Good morning. Hey, good question. So a few things. You're right, we're not going to give detailed guidance on 2018, but a few things to think about in light of what we've done this year. First of all, the factoring, just as I said in the prepared comments, are the ceasing of the sales of short-term receivables is a one-time timing issue. It is historically a pull-forward of short-term \u2013 cash related short-term receivables of 30 to 60 days. When you start up a program, it has a favorable impact back in 2009. This hasn't had much of an impact in recent years, plus or minus. But now that we're ceasing a majority of it, it will have that $350 million approximate negative impact this year. It will have no impact to run rate cash flow for next year.\nAs far as other things to think about when you're looking towards next year. If you recall, we originally had talked about pension contributions over a two-year period being at the $800 million range; $350 million this year, $450 million next year. The incremental pension contribution we made this year with the debt that we issued in September brings down those future contribution levels to more normalized levels. Not to give an exact amount, but historically in the $200 million range, whereas I think before most people were modeling $450 million, $500 million for next year. But the thought is for it to be a more constant, stable number in the future in the $200 million range.\nAs far as CapEx, our CapEx is primarily related to IT-type spend, and we've been seeing more and more as we go to cloud-based solutions that it's ending up being more OpEx-related IT than CapEx historically. I would still think we'd be in the CapEx range, $100 million, $150 million. M&A type deals we target, tuck-in type deals, especially in the GIS arena. And we've said that could be anywhere, $100 million, $200 million in a given year depending on the number of deals you're doing there. So those are sort of big picture type items with respect to cash to think about future years. But we'll be more explicit obviously in the January earnings call."]], ["So I was just curious in terms of go-to-market with A4, as it is a little newer here with Xerox after being away from that market for a good number of years. ", ["I see, thank you. Not at all. So no, it's been part of our strategy. Look, we only have about a 5% market share in A4 and when we were, what I'll call a two division company, basically we were managing the business more for profits, more for cash and we're still doing that, don't get me wrong, but we believe now that we have a much more cost competitive A4 portfolio with the 12 new products that we've just introduced, not only will it benefit us in Managed Document Services, as I said, it'll give us much more opportunity, especially with a coherency in A3 and it should actually improve our gross margins in that space because we'll be able to architect the solutions differently. It will also enable us to bring on more channel partners than we have in the past because we've always been the leader in A3 and everybody wants our A3 solutions. But now when resellers go to market they need both an A3 and an A4 solution. So we'll be able to provide both to them and the fact that we now have at least 45 new partners coming on with more to come, says that they really like what they're seeing in the products and there's a lot of excitement in it. And again, if you would \u2013 your second part of the question now?"]], ["I guess, are there other things you guys are considering that maybe we should be bracing for as we look ahead that could impact free cash flow for our modeling perspective? ", ["Yeah. Hey, Jim, it's Bill. I'll answer the first question regarding the free cash flow guidance. The way that we look at it really is that the underlying cash flow actually we feel very good about what's happened year-to-date and the progress we've seen as far as underlying cash flow as a company, we actually raised based upon the original basis, the $700 million to $900 million range to $800 million to $1 billion based upon that.\nBut as far as the surprise it's actually the $500 million when we did the debt, or note issuance back in September we disclosed that $500 million of the $1 billion note was going to be used for this and revised the cash flow guidance at that time for that $500 million which we view as a positive because it's allowing us to have more stable pension contributions going forward as opposed to having certain required amounts being higher like this year was $350 million, next year $450 million, $500 million. So we believe it will be more stable going towards the future so that's $500 million we put out there in the September timeframe.\nAnd as far as the ceasing of the short-term sale of receivables, we believe just from a strategic transformation perspective, the savings associated with that, whether it was the interest costs with the effect of borrowing or the administrative costs that that working capital management tool just wasn't for the needed except there's a limited part that's left and we see that as a positive from a savings perspective, $10 million going forward.\nSo yeah, there is the one-time timing. But as I explained in Shannon's initial question, it's just the timing, pulled forward cash 30 days to 60 days. And as far as ongoing run rates, this really has no impact on 2018.\nAnd as far as other things being thought about or considered really nothing. I mean, I laid out some initial thoughts regarding 2018 cash flow considerations when answering Shannon's question and really nothing else other than that.\nJeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.\nYeah, and, Jim, on the signings, if you go from a constant currency basis on a year-to-date basis, we've declined about 7% with growth in the renewables and declines in the new business. We expect to see the new business improving in Q4, so we expect to have strong improvements versus the year-to-date signings we've seen in Q4 for sure.\nJennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.\nGreat. Thanks, Jim. That's all the time we have for questions today. We appreciate the interest of everyone who has tuned in. Jeff, anything to wrap up?\nJeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.\nI just want to thank everybody for your questions. As I mentioned last quarter, we are keenly focused on the work ahead of us. We're positioning ourselves to reverse our revenue trajectory trends over time. We understand the market and are successful come by operationally laying the building blocks to capture share of the growing workplace, marketplace and increase our participation in the expanding high-end color market. We continue to make headway on our strategy and are confident in our ability to meet our full year commitments. We look forward to updating you on our progress. Thanks so much for joining the call.\nJennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.\nGreat. Thanks, Jeff. And that concludes our call."]], ["I appreciate why you narrowed the top end of the range, just given you would need to see well above normal seasonality in the back half to hit the prior top end of the range. ", ["Yeah hey, Katy, it's Bill Osbourn here. Thanks for the question. So let me just give some thoughts to you on all the four measures that we give a little guidance on, on the adjusted EPS. But first of all, adjusted operating margin, we gave guidance at 12.5% to 13.5%, reaffirming that. We're very comfortable with where we're at year-to-date, 13.3% in Q2, first half at 12.2%. And just to remind everyone, the third quarter is typically our seasonally our second weakest quarter of the year, but Q4 is our strongest from an operating margin and from a revenues perspective. But we're still very comfortable with the 12.5% to 13. 5% range and believe we're set up pretty well for that.\nRevenues mid-single-digit down in constant currency for the full year; first half, we are 5.4% down. We believe the second half will be better than the 5.4% down at constant currency with once again Q4 being the strongest quarter of the year and Q4 being better than Q3.\nFrom an operating cash flow perspective, once again, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're very pleased with where we ended for Q2 at $343 million, $533 million for the first half of this year. And I think most everybody knows and I'll just remind everyone the timing of our pension payments we gave guidance towards $350 million in pension payments for the full year, which is still on track, but only $46 million were made in the first half. So a lot of the pension payments are back loaded. There's also some timing of payables, with payables management that was a help in the first half that won't necessarily repeat in the second half.\nSo then after all that getting to your question regarding the adjusted EPS and really, there a lot of factors as you can imagine that go into it. There are some favorable things in particular. Currency, we think based on current spot rates, will be a little bit better than we had expected as far as the headwind at the beginning of the year, in particular in Q4. And Q3 will probably be similar as far as the negative impact to the first half of the year, but Q4 we expect to have a more modest negative impact from a currency perspective.\nThe Fuji Xerox provision is clearly a favorable item. And in the first quarter, we took that $30 million hit on that and that was revised $24 million or most of it was revised out. So, some favorable items there, but to get to the higher end of the range, a few things. We had \u2013 everything had to go right regarding the product transition, and Jeff, in a lot of his comments talked about that. A lot of things have got right, but not everything as far as the timing. There have been some delays. Also, we still plan. We've done a lot of investment year-to-date in the A4 area, which everyone knows has a negative margin upon the initial sale in most cases, but is profitable over the life of the equipment. We plan to have \u2013 we want to have flexibility, continue to do as much of that as we can. We've done a fair amount in first half. We want to continue doing that in the second half of the year. And this, leaving \u2013 to answer your question specifically, leaving the lower end of the range opened or not adjusting that leaves you opportunity to be flexible, where opportunities arise in the A4 area.\nAnd then, one of the bigger things is that, from a tax perspective, we gave guidance range of 25% to 28% for the full year for effective tax rate. And year-to-date, we've been in the 27% range. We think that might be lower a little bit with some things you see and maybe in the second half. But still, it is higher than the midpoint of the range so far this year. All those things factor in. We thought it was prudent to narrow the range, given half the year is up and we basically removed the top 25% or $0.08 from it.\nJennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.\nGreat. Thanks, Katy. Operator, next question please."]], ["Just sticking with that cost saves topic, guys, I believe of the $1.5 billion cumulative 2018 target, $500 million was incremental and $1 billion was sort of your business as usual saves. ", ["Yeah. A couple of thoughts. So yeah, I'd agree, this incremental about $500 million over three years versus what was more BAU already on the cost reductions. But one of the main reasons why was to allow for investment and investment includes things like the A4s, being able to sell A4s up front, which are at a negative margin or a loss initially but profitable over the life.\nBut it also offsets other headwinds, such as currency. We've had significant currency headwinds, both last year and this year, and the incremental amounts over the BAU allowed us to still increase margins despite those currency headwinds, and like I said, it allows us to do investments, so the investment in selling initial A4s or investments in the way we are doing things internally.\nJeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.\nYeah. And I think, Ananda, and good to hear your voice again on these calls. I should mention that, when Bill talks about investments, it's not just the new products, but it's what we're doing with the SMB expansion. We brought on more than 30 new partners and it's almost evenly split between the financial operations in North America, but it requires investment there. It's demand generation.\nWe've hired dozens of new logo hunters. And as the year goes on, we hope to even do more A4 investment, because as we see the success of this, and as you know that's an investment putting those devices in, but we'll get the benefit on the post sale. So we could see ourselves doing more and more of that once we get even more comfortable than we are with where we are for the full year."]], ["So my question is, of that $500 million in the context of the sort of the net new investments you've been making, how should we think or how would you like us to think about a potential for drop-through to the bottom line over the next couple of years?

", ["Yeah, I would say clearly, it would be a mix that there would be a mix of investments. But some would continue to drop to the bottom line and we're not giving guidance in out years, but I would expect cost transformation, although maybe not at the same levels that you see in these three years, will continue as a significant part of this company's future.\nJeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.\nYeah. And another way, Ananda, I'd look at this, and this is I think where we laid it out at the investor conference. Just to make the math easier, let's just say on an $11 billion business or a $10 billion business, mid single digit declines would be 5%. So let's take $500 million, until you turn the revenue trajectory and we should not lose sight of the fact that when we started this 18 months ago and announced this program, it was not just to drive cost out, but it was to be able to reinvest back in so that we can change the revenue trajectory so that we're not declining at that mid single-digit level in the outer years.\nSo right now, the cost transformation program is being used to offset the revenue decline and it's not just putting the margin, the 40% gross margin on the revenue declines. You have some price erosion in the industry, et cetera, which drops 100% to the bottom line. As we're able to take those declines from mid-single digits to something better, we'll have more opportunity to drop more to the bottom line as we also continue to reinvest.\nJennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.\nGreat. Thanks, Ananda. Operator, next question."]], ["Or you just kind of reminding people of what's normal?\nAnd then my second question is, you narrowed your EPS guide by taking the high end down, but the operating cash flow and free cash flow didn't change at all. ", ["Hey, Jim, it's Bill. Thanks for the questions. So, yeah, regarding the Q4 versus Q3 from a revenues perspective, a couple of things. You're right that Q4 seasonally our strongest quarter from a revenues perspective each year and that normally occurs. This year, we expect there to be even more of a ramp, the degree of it, we're not giving that specificity, but more ramp than normal because of the new product launch.\nNot giving specific guidance as to flat or positive for Q4, but as far as Q4, it's owned. But we do expect there's a normal ramp from Q3 to Q4 that occurs. We expect there to be more of a ramp this year than in prior years just because of the full availability of our products at that point in time.\nAs far as EPS and operating cash flow, once again, there are a lot of variabilities, as you know, that go into operating cash flow. And one of them in particular is the pension contributions, and we've said $350 million. It's an area that we look at closely as far as our funded pension status. And just want to leave things open from the perspective of whether we want to have flexibility for maybe additional funding there. But yes, normally, all else being equal, you would \u2013 you could have a slightly less, actually operating cash flow because taking off the top, but it's not that significant compared to all the variables that go into determining it.\nJennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.\nThanks, Jim. Operator, I think we have time for one last question."]], ["Again, I understand this year you have puts and takes with more restructuring and that, but when you get into 2018, can you talk a little bit about how you are thinking about cash flow? ", ["Yeah. Hi, Shannon. This is Bill Osbourn. I'll touch on that. So, cash flow, as we talked about at the year-end earnings call, it's really the same thoughts or similar thoughts that \u2013 both 2017 and 2018 would be below what we would think our normalized cash flow would be, about $1 billion. And the two primary items which you mentioned are the higher pension contributions over that period of time being approximately $100 million-plus higher each given year. And then also, we were going to have higher restructuring payments each of those two years as we were doing our strategic transformation. We would expect those to normalize and have a $200 million-plus benefit versus to get to a more normalized $1 billion cash flow in 2019 and beyond.\nSo similar to what we said at year-end both 2017 and 2018 would be dampened by approximately $200 million. We are working continuously to improve our working capital both from an inventory management perspective, managing receivables, payables, timing, et cetera, and we have some specific projects in place to really focus on inventory management, but the primary things impacting the normalized cash flow are the higher restructuring payments this year and next year, and the higher pension contributions. As far as your second part of your question regarding the uses of cash, similar thoughts to year-end.\nGiven the $700 million to $900 million of operating cash flow we're expecting this year, and our cash on hand on the balance sheet at the end of the year, we projected to have about $1 billion to $1.2 billion in cash available. We're going to pay down incremental $300 million of debt, which we did during the quarter; dividends around $280 million, CapEx we're guiding about $175 million and M&A in the $100 million range. That left, if you're doing the math, about $100 million to $300 million that we're evaluating the best uses of, whether that's paying down additional debt, whether M&A opportunities come along, et cetera.\nAt this point, although we continually look at it regarding share repurchases, we're not planning on making any share repurchase at this time, but as you state, we'll look at the market and factors, share price, and we evaluate it, but at this point our goal is to invest in future growth opportunities and maintain the quality of our balance sheet.\nJennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.\nOkay. Great."]], ["On the reported earnings, I think, they were about $0.15 and if I do the math correctly it looks like that includes the cost of the Fujifilm of about $0.03, and you're keep \u2013 if you can confirm that, and you're keeping the full year EPS unchanged. ", ["Yeah. Hey, Jim. It's Bill. Hey, great question. As far as the Fuji Xerox, just to confirm it is a $0.03 impact in our adjusted EPS, so the $0.15 adjusted EPS does include that $0.03 or $30 million charge, or we would have been say it another way, $0.18 without it.\nClearly, we did not know anything when we gave guidance back in January about this charge when we were setting guidance for the full year. With that said, when you go throughout the year, and we update and we do detailed analyses internally projecting for the rest of the year, there are puts and takes that occur and I'm not going to go through all the details of those but one example of that is we give guidance at the beginning of the year and factor in a certain amount of transaction currency headwinds for the year. Updated based upon current foreign currency rates, we see that being a couple of pennies less for the rest of the year and that would be something that we factor in to our updated overall guidance analysis.\nSo the $0.03 clearly was not expected; however, it is factored into the full year updated guidance now and when we look at other puts and takes that come into play as we update each quarter end and we're reaffirming the $0.80 and $0.88 and knowing that that $0.03 charge is in the Q1."]], ["So in essence when you include Fuji costs, are you raising your full year because now you have Fuji costs or the investigation that's going on, or is that something that you're kind of always anticipating and maybe just now it's more communicating to us?

", ["Yes. So we were not dissatisfied by any means with the 5.7% decline in equipment revenue. If you look at the second half of last year, we were a little over 10% in constant currency declines in the second half and 8.7% for the full year. So the 5.7% was an improvement and, again, that was up without really getting the benefits.\nWith the Versant launch, which was three new products, if we go back to whenever we've launched Versant in past years, we did get a nice bump. It's just coming in in April. So we would think, believe and hope and certainly in May and June we should start seeing the benefits of that.\nIf I look at entry from an ESR standpoint, down 5.5% and if I look at the install, color installs were up 15%. Part of that was the nice bump we got towards the end when we did bring in four of the A4 products. Midrange really didn't help us. We didn't bring out any new products but in Q2 we will be bringing out all 17 of the mid-range A3 products, and again, I think that will help us much more in the second half of the year.\nJennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.\nGreat. Thanks, Katy."]], ["So the question is, is there something specific to 5G that is more detrimental, and I know your revenues are higher in wireless versus what they were before?\nAnd then my quick follow-up, it's a more blocking and tackling, Lorenzo, when you said second half gross margin comes back to a more normal level, or how do you define normal, and does that imply then wireless slows down considerably? ", ["So let me take the first partition. So look first of all, as you said, it's really a very different place in terms of the magnitude and size. And by the way, I want to also clarify, we're far from peaking, right, because this is just a very early stage of 5G. 5G is going to continue on for quite some time, because 5G is very ambitious. I mean, we see 5G being factors larger than 4G over its entirety.\nAnd the other thing is that we're talking about very advanced technologies, right, I mean the kinds of expense for developing silicon back in the initial deployment of 4G is significantly by many factors different, right, so I think you need to think about it that way as well.\nAnd then, I'll begin the part \u2013 the starting part about the margins, I\u2019ll let Lorenzo pickup from there. I don't think the way you've got to think about it is if it comes back there for while, it's goes down substantially. I think we are seeing a much heavier mix, and I think what we're trying to get across here is that other markets strengthened, we get a little bit broader strengthened, so that's the way should look at it as opposed to this big drop off in wireless.\nLorenzo Flores\nRight. So I think at this point Ambrish, before Analyst Day, I want to stay in a relatively qualitative space in terms of providing guidance or shaping the year in terms of gross margin. What we're trying to communicate and just really to elaborate a little bit on what Victor laid out is, we are at this point in the year seeing a very heavy concentration on wireless. It is significantly bigger than we have seen in the past, and that is as everybody follows the company knows puts pressure on our gross margins.\nSo we see in the second half as I tried to lay out in my comments that other elements of the business, including ones that are traditionally stronger gross margin will continue to grow and balance out our mix. And when I say more typical, I think I'm pointing to ranges we would have seen in the past. I'd like to leave it at that until we get to Analyst Day. That's okay."]], ["What's going on with I can't remember if you called AIT or IAT in the second quarter, where you said it was down?\nAnd then if we think in the second half, it seems like that bucket is the part that needs to get better to help your mix and improve the gross margin back to your average levels. ", ["Okay. So first, let me explain the TME, I'm glad you asked that. So recall the TME actually has got a bunch of sub-segments within that. One of them includes semiconductor test. For a while, semiconductor test was in very strong position. But as we all know, particularly in the memory side, things dramatically weakened. So we did see general semiconductor test weakened for us.\nAnother sub segment is emulation prototyping. And I think Lorenzo maybe bleakly alluded to that, but I will say that we did have one significant customer that, you can kind of say that sort of in a bit of a transition situation. So there was a pause there and that wasn't exactly expected.\nHaving said that, we also saw some strength, but it wasn't enough to overcome those headwinds and the strength was in some advanced testers, because of 5G being deployed, right. So even when that TME, we have some diversity, it just happened to fairly big elements at this point weakened, but again, we do see in the second half of FY 2020 that strengthened again.\nAnd yes, sorry about all the acronyms, I'm sure once you get used to the PLAs, actually be better clarity, because we are separating things out more giving you a more granularity. But I think your general proposition that, yes, kind of like the gross \u2013 the enterprise level gross margin will rebalance as much, because other things are coming into play. And again, of course, wireless is still matter, but it's not solely moving just on wireless. So Lorenzo, you want to...\nLorenzo Flores\nYes, you actually did a pretty good job, Ross, on the nomenclature. AIT include some relatively large revenue segment. And the first half, two of them will be relatively low, but we look to them and we have some visibility into what's driving the strength in the second half of the year. Those coming back heavier into our overall mix and the continued growth of other elements of our business that are closer to our corporate average gross margin, those will push the gross margin back up, as I described earlier."]], ["I'm hoping you can help us better understand the strategy around the portfolio as it relates to M&A and venture investments, there's been some pretty heavy speculation that you were looking at a large public company that someone else acquired, but here you're announcing a smaller acquisition today, and I think you said 20 investments in the venture fund. ", ["Yes, two quick questions. Let me give you some high level and I'll have Matt, who runs our, Corp. Dev. maybe add some color. So it's just at the highest level, I think the kind of thing you should look at, I think we've been consistent in both what we said and more importantly our actions, is that whenever you do M&A, it will be very strongly aligned with our strategy, right. Either fortifying that strategy position, and of course in the long run may be increasing the opportunity. If it's a bigger business, obviously, there should be acceleration in the more tangible and full near-term kind of range.\nI wouldn't say, we've already \u2013 we've ever said, hey, we're only looking at \"tuck-ins\", or like, hey, we're only guiding for public-to-public and stuff like that. I would say that we look at every opportunity, we look at what we feel is makes the most sense for us, but again the common theme will be strongly aligned to our strategy, which has three different elements to it.\nMatt, you want to add anything more to that?\nMatt Poirier\nYes. And look from our perspective, anything we can do that aligns with the strategy that ultimately balances the time to achieve the returns that we're guiding to against the value that we're providing through an investment or through an acquisition. We're certainly very focused on balancing that.\nAppropriately from a VC perspective, we do have a venture activity that has been more active for the last two fiscal years. We'll talk more about that in the Analyst Day. But from an increase in the ecosystem engagement with data center partners, applications providers, I'm helping to build our Alveo ecosystem, increasing engagement with Xilinx's platform, that's all part of the focus.\nAnd then to Victor's point, whether that's a tuck-in acquisition. That's more technology and team focused versus a larger business acquisition. Those will absolutely be down along with the strategy of the company across our elements we've provided more contexts on.\nVictor Peng\nOne thing maybe I'd like to point out is like, the DeePhi of course, that was a team that has deep expertise and innovative IP and machine learning, which is actually quite broad, right. It's just not data center, it's actually quite broad. The announcement of our intention to try and acquire Solarflare that's more related to specifically the networking opportunity that we've talked about in data center.\nBut also within that, they have \u2013 as far as R&D goes, it's predominantly software and systems kind of expertise. I think that strongly in my opening remarks that we are also looking to see how we complement our expertise. I think we're well known being really leaders and doing very advanced silicon and a lot of software close to the metal so to speak. So I think the other trend you can kind of see is us going out and getting talent in IP that complements and brings us higher up the solution stack, if you will."]], ["So Vic, I think you said that 5G is going to be many times bigger than 4G and you guys are talking about the margins on wireless being below the corporate average. ", ["I mean, let me again answer that qualitatively. The other thing that we haven't yet said just to sort of bring your attention to is that, people that are shipping now on volume for this early phase of 5G, they're using very advanced technologies, right. This is our 16-nanometer very leading-edge technologies, certainly there many communications people that are looking at Versal already, even before silicon arrives.\nIn the early part of when we have new products, right, if they're \u2013 they still have room in terms of cost reduction, in terms of yields and other things we do to optimize and reduce our cost to some extent the other fact about this being deployed sooner than we expected is, it's happening at a point in our kind of our cost road maps that are reasonable, but it has certainly has room for improvement. And so we're working very aggressively towards that, right. So that's one point, right.\nI think the other thing is, in general, we're trying to and we are adding more value by doing things like integrating high-performance analog technology monolithically. And we're doing other things to create value and therefore support higher margins through that perspective.\nAnd we talked about the mix enough, but what I would say is there's no one silver bullet, right. It's just basically working hard at a bunch of things, both on the cost side, on the value side, on just how we go to market and things like that. So that's what we're doing."]], ["Victor, just a question on the radio side, I guess, when you go to 5G, there are multiple radios, do you see any change in the competitive landscape in terms of \u2013 do you see that getting replaced by ASICs, or you see that still being FPGAs for some time? ", ["Okay. Yes, so for the first part, I don't \u2013 again, I think our position on radio is strong and actually getting stronger. I don't really see the ASIC replacement. Again, there is no one even the big players from either the analog side or digital side that has integrated such high performance capability in that.\nAnd again, we have other aspects of the IP, not just ADCs and DACs, but some of things we do with the SoC as well as the fabric itself, and other areas we're adding value to the overall platform, if you will. So I don't think we have much risk there. We've been very open about the baseband side, and that's probably our greatest risk in terms of ASIC displacement.\nIn terms of future generations, I think we are talking about this process node. We absolutely will support in the 7-nanometer generation. Versal is the name of a product family. We have six sub families that we refer to a series. So there is an RF Series with Versal 7-nanometer, but that's a ways out.\nAnd we will be supplying, delivering and driving revenue for a number of years for the 16-nanometer generation. When we are out there with the 7-nanometer since we do investment in that entire portfolio, we still get a good return.\nAgain, against the fact that our architectures are scalable and also modular, and I said multiple times Versal is going to hit essentially over time every end market that we have. So it's a very \u2013 it's still a very leveraged investment, a very big investment, getting bigger with each advanced node. But it will be \u2013 it will provide a very good return."]], ["And also on the gross margin side, as you guys go down to Gen 2, Gen 3 with millimeter wave capabilities and 7-nanometer, how do you think the gross margins trend on the radio is going forward? ", ["Okay. Yes, so for the first part, I don't \u2013 again, I think our position on radio is strong and actually getting stronger. I don't really see the ASIC replacement. Again, there is no one even the big players from either the analog side or digital side that has integrated such high performance capability in that.\nAnd again, we have other aspects of the IP, not just ADCs and DACs, but some of things we do with the SoC as well as the fabric itself, and other areas we're adding value to the overall platform, if you will.

But it will be \u2013 it will provide a very good return."]], ["And just maybe following up on the last one, just as a recollection from the 4G ramp, you guys were traditionally more heavier or strong in radios and less in the BTS. ", ["Yes, so first of all, I want to reaffirm what you said that, yes, we traditionally have been stronger in radio than baseband. And if anything, we will be even stronger in the radio, and there are more radios. Now you're also right that we have greater strength right now in this early phase on the baseband, and why is that?\nThat's kind of interesting, right. There's a few things. One is that we're not just the same old FPGA, technology and what we've implemented in UltraScale+ is really advanced, right. And there is very few people still that have the breadth and the scale of products. Our products are very flexible. Therefore, when standards are only frozen pretty soon and then people want to deploy. The carriers want to deploy. We can get you there, right.\nOur adaptability and flexibility enables you to go-to-market very rapidly even in a very changing dynamic market. So I think that highlights one of our key value propositions, which now with our capability being significantly more than in the 4G generation is coming to the floor.\nI'd say, the counter side to it, these ASICs are really hard. There are fewer companies that have either the financial justification for the assets required or even the technical capabilities to execute that well, particularly in a changing market. So ASICs need some degree of stability and spaces in order to get taped out, and the things are always changing, you just can't do it. That you have to sort of do with the super set of everything, which kind of defeats the whole purpose of doing an ASIC, so I think there's kind of a relative thing going on here.\nThat all said, again, we've just been very candid that we don't see that the strength that we have in the near-term that necessarily going to completely persist. We will always maintain some position. But then 7-nanometer comes, because we've taken it up several levels in the architectural innovation and 7-nanometers, we hope to be able to capture more than the historical norm."]], ["So, Victor, I'm curious, as you are starting to get into these 5G deployments, what is the range of content you are seeing in these deployments and how would you contrast it with 4G?\nAnd as part of that, how do you address some investor concern about when there could be competition from ASICs or merchant silicon, right, which we saw back in the 3G and 4G days? ", ["So I think in earlier calls, we've talked about how we are in virtually all the pre-5G proof-of-concepts and demonstrations, not only in the radio but even in the baseband. So as we really started seeing true deployments in North Korea and the very, very early beginnings of that in China. We do have content both in radio, which we've traditionally always been strong in and also in the baseband.\nSo I would say, yes. South Korea -- I would say, yes, we have higher content right now. I would also point out that 5G is going to be a -- I've said this in previous calls, 5G is going to be a larger deployment overall, compared to the previous -- the past generations.\nAnd we're also innovative quite a bit, right, with our SoCs, as well as the analog, really high performance analog that we've integrated for our RFSoCs. So I do think because of our capability, we will have more persistence in the past. However, yes, ASICs will come on board.\nI would say that in this first generation of deployment, it's not clear that will necessarily hang on to the baseband component, but there'll be follow-on with second and third generations. And again, are on the radio side we're very strong and even stronger than ever, and on the baseband side particularly when we come out with our 7-nanometer Versal product, I think, we have a good shot at having good longevity also even in baseband."]], ["Can you talk about, I guess, particularly on the comp side, what you're doing there, if at all, to drive margins higher, particularly with next-generation products?\nAnd how we should think about the trajectory as we move forward? ", ["Okay. We'll try to cover it all. Yeah. I'll cover the first and Lorenzo will definitely cover the second. So, yeah, I mean, in terms of the gross margin, you're right. I mean, as we have a big component of our growth is the actual production deployments now we're starting to see with 5G and because of that and a few other product mixes that does bring the gross margin down somewhat.\nI would say what do we do in terms of driving gross margin? Well, there are a number things that we do not just for wireless, but in general on what we do to drive our margin and that ranges from all kinds of cost saving issues, just disciplined in terms of other things on the business side.\nBut I think the biggest thing and the RFSoC is a perfect example of that. We're innovating, so we are providing a great deal more value to our customers and we end up in the sense both profiting, the classic win-win, right? Because at the system level, we are actually saving cost, power, more, in fact, the weight. And because of that we do hold more value when we truly innovate and provide this capability that, in the case of RFSoCs no one has a product like that.\nSo I think there is all the -- there's not one silver bullet we go, walking and tapping on all these things that we always do on an ongoing basis. But the big needle mover is when we innovate, right? And again starting with whom we integrated the SoC with the first actually Zynq and continuing that innovation roadmap is, I think, the big needle movers over time.\nLorenzo Flores\nSo, I think, Victor, covered the gross margin piece quite comprehensively. So I'll just get on the tax rate. I will say we haven't provided specific guidance for FY 2020 on the tax rate. But if you look at the general expectations for tax in FY 2019, we were thinking we'd be in the 10% to 12% range.\nThe quarter-to-quarter lumpiness has come from as the tax reform regulations have solidified, there are different pieces that we have to incorporate into the quarterly tax rate that we are providing for. But over the long-term I would expect to get back to that more normalized rate. But again I have to take the caveat, we haven't given specific FY 2020 guidance yet, C.J. Hope that helps."]], ["So just help us understand or give us your perspective on how you're thinking about it?\nAnd then my quick question follow-up is could you talk a little bit about the growth and the traction that you talked about that Alveo, if I'm pronouncing it correctly was the second half phenomena. ", ["Okay. Yeah. The China trading situation, we have continued to monitor that very carefully. As you said, it's very difficult to predict. So certainly we think about what appropriate actions might be reasonable should certain scenarios occur, but really since that's really unpredictable and we don't want to just take action rashly, we're just going to watch it and then react, respond appropriately.\nSo I think we thought in two different scenarios. But, clearly, right now for the facts, we know that the tariffs that are in place do impact us, where if the things stay the way they are, we will continue to do the business. But we have put thought into different scenarios. So I probably should just leave it at that, since again once it's quite speculative what could happen.\nTo the question around Alveo and you did pronounced it correctly. We've already said that this fiscal year is going to be very modest revenue and it will become more meaningful next fiscal year and actually more in the second half, because we did only launched it in October and we only started shipping and production in November. So it's very early, but I would say that, I think, I had mentioned in earlier calls that the really early, very right out of the gate, there was very strong interest.\nI'd say, we're very comfortable happy where it is right now. I mentioned the qualification at Dell, there's activity with other OEMs, as well as partners. We're building out the channels, the infrastructure. We're engaged in a number of PoCs. And next fiscal year is when we see that going more -- transitioning more into production. So I'm very happy with it. It's a small amount right now.\nIn terms of the margin piece, no, it doesn't really -- we don't anticipate it particularly impacting the margin. Again, we think we delivered tremendous value, not only in just the silicone and the board, but the software infrastructure that goes along with it. We will price it competitively, but we feel like we are delivering a lot of value. So we will see that as an exposure, let's say, and weakening the company's overall margin."]], ["But with year-on-year comps rev up about 40% year-on-year, it looks like this ramp is perhaps a bit steeper than the prior cycle and December rev only about 5% lower than the 2014 peak.\nI was hoping you could elaborate a bit on, one, how this ramp is played out relative to expectations, say, 12 months ago? ", ["Yeah. clearly, we didn't anticipate the ramp starting as early as it did. I think we said that on the last call. So the start of this ramp is happening faster than we had thought. And the strength for coming out of the gate is pretty strong. I did allude to the fact that we're shipping both in some cases not all, in some cases both in baseband, as well as in the radio. So I think a combination of all those is what's giving the strong strength.\nI will say that this speaks to one of our strengths relative to ASICs, right. I mean, just again we've talked about one of our key value props in multiple markets is, you're not high to get the market on tape-out cycles as much. Once we've come up with products, people could come out with new capability very rapidly.\nBut I would still say if you look at there will still be some adversity into this market. That's unlike what we said about Data Center. I don't think 5G is going to be just as a steady climb. But this is the early -- this is still the earlier deployment, we definitely still believe that in 2020 and beyond that there will be more strength and more growth. So, yes, this is a bit stronger than what we anticipated, but I think there's more to come. So that help?"]], ["And then, two, just the content growth you are seeing has already brought you close to the 2014 peak levels just given we're still relatively early innings in this build out?

", ["There is definitely an expanding TAM, because again, I think, 5G over time will definitely be a much bigger deployment. It's so much more rich in terms of what it's doing, the performance is going about orders of magnitude, so there's going to be TAM expansion.\nI do think that we will also gain share, right? People are as you say playing the game coming from the other side, perhaps. But I would say that still today and we haven't heard of any credible real comparable product people are trying to do integration that are more in advanced packaging kind of mode, which is not the same thing as fully monolithic integration. We already have a roadmap for follow-on products, not only in 16-nanometers, but 7-nanometers.\nSo I think it is going to be both and by the way this is simply just an integration play. People are re-architecting the radio, right. And the different layers in terms of what's in the radio and what sort of at the next level and up in the cloud and [indiscernible] I think they got. So there is also disruption in the overall architecture and we enable the things that I think are going to be more challenged than some other traditional solutions."]], ["As we look forward into fiscal year 2020, how should we think about the rate of OpEx growth relative to revenue growth?\nI think, Victor, in the past you've talked about big opportunities facing the company therefore you need to be aggressive. ", ["Yeah. I mean in one sentence I suppose my response will be a little boring and that, yes, you just repeat it, there's no change in that perspective. We do want to be able to sustain this growth. We think the opportunity we have in on a strategic level and long arc of thing is very significant. But it does take investment. We just take tape out our 7-nanometer product, $36 billion transistors, right?\nThis is an incredibly complex and powerful product. As you can imagine that's the first product we have -- we announced when we launched it at XTF six subfamily. So we are going to continue to invest in 7-nanometers. We're not completely done in 16, because of the strength of 16 we've gotten some additional interest and some follow-on. So we are going to drive this growth and we are going to balance earnings expansion, as well as continue to invest, so we can keep this kind of growth up.\nLorenzo Flores\nRight. So, the quarter-to-quarter step up was exactly in line with what we had provided at our -- for an annual guide. So it's within the parameters we've already discussed all based on the strategies that Victor just articulated. And so -- we haven't -- and we're not going to in this call give FY'20 guidance. But I think the strategy remains consistent and it's consistent, if you refer back to the previous question on how we're going to drive revenue growth in the future."]], ["I think in your comments about 5G baseband, I think, you kind of said, you won't be able to hang on to some of the early designs wins in the preproduction baseband. ", ["Sure. And I guess, this is always this thing that I'm trying to do of being very candid, at the same time, not trying to get to the thing that we don't have a very good opportunity here, right?\nSo what I mean is, so 5G is not just a single point in time. There really clearly are going to be generations of 5G, because 5G is really umbrella of standards, as well as technology. And the very early deployments that we're seeing now it doesn't have the full features and capabilities. So you're going to see wave of 5G technologies, as well as, of course, deployment. We are participating in baseband which traditionally we haven't. And that's part of the growth, right?\nI think in this first generation, certainly in certain areas we do think that when ASICs catch up, because again they tend to lag that we'll lose some of that baseband. Hopefully, we're still holding on to some of it. What I was saying is that, with our similar Versal [ph], because that is still more powerful in some of the engagement that we're seeing that we believe we have a much stronger shot of maintaining baseband and of course continue to expand on our strength in radio and so forth, right? And by the way in 5G there's going to be more radio, so it's not like our success hangs on the baseband, but of course, we would like to capture those value as we can. So I hope that helps a little bit more in my comment."]], ["And I guess I\u2019m out with several of your customers at your developers forum and we kind of heard about the use of Zync and about, specifically we heard the comment that if Xilinx had more libraries, then we\u2019d be able to use I think some more applications. ", ["It's a very good point and again we're really trying to work that balance of continuing to invest. We can keep on this very strong growth, but also return to the investors. And so you will see some growth and on a percentage basis, we're increasing our headcount in software and IP and things above the silicon level if you will much more. Having said that, we're also putting a big focus, that's why you hear me in the highlights and I think hopefully you took away from our developer\u2019s forum that we're really trying driving ecosystem. So it\u2019s not just the Xilinx R&D budget, but it's the collective budget of the ecosystem as well as partners like AND, like Samsung and others. So it\u2019s an and of all those things, we're going to try and do all those things. But, it is part of our balance on how we deliver returns as well as continue to invest, so that we can get higher leverage and more leverage in the model."]], ["Victor, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more, in your prepared comments, you said that you have your eye on the macro and if I look at the businesses that are probably most macro influence for you, it\u2019s industrial and A&D. ", ["Yeah well. A&D actually was down already in the current quarter, but that was off a very strong quarter and we actually believe that going forward, that\u2019s going to strengthen up again. So we actually don't see any signs in the A&D area for sensitive to that. I'll give you one where we do as a sub-segment of our overall basket. As you know, our baskets are pretty big, right, so test measure and emulation and prototyping. Within that, there are semiconductor tests and we are seeing weakening as you might expect within that.\nOn the other hand, emulation and prototyping, we're seeing great strength. So given all of those puts and takes, we\u2019re still seeing TME is on track for an excellent year. So, and also within test, there's also a very special, just as including like 5G test equipment and we\u2019re seeing good strength there for obvious reasons. So, I think this is -- part of this is the strength of the diversity that we have and also the high value and innovation that we have that we're less sensitive than to other products that are \u2013 perhaps, there are more options available for people just to switch in and out or it\u2019s just not as high value or not in the core to system, right.\nSo I think that's one aspect of it. And again, we walked into this quarter with very strong backlog. I mean, we feel good about the guidance and then of course FY20, we give that in the Analyst Day and we certainly will earn a lot between now and then, but again, we\u2019ve looked at it and certainly, we're very keenly aware of the environment, we're just seeing good signals for our business."]], ["I know, there is probably a lot you can't talk about, but I wanted to give you the opportunity to elaborate on that comment and what gives you that confidence, is this new customers, is this silicon to board. ", ["Yeah. Well, it's actually a blend, as I said. We actually did get some revenue at the very end of Q2 for Alveo boards and by the way, we only have one board, well actually, we have two boards, the U200 and U250. But we are going to launch more boards through the course of the next short number of quarters. And, I said that they don't grow at a good rate, but it's starting from a very small number. So it's not meaningful, but FY20 will be meaningful. So if you step back, I mean, we didn't have a board\u2019s revenue stream at all, right. So that certainly is contributing to that.\nThe other thing is there's a lot of games that I can't really speak to right now, but I did get -- I am able to say, so I mentioned Samsung\u2019s smart SSD, they launched that. I can tell you that we have a design win to do a smart memory DIM with a very major memory supplier, but I cannot say who. So, and then, as you know, a lot of the customers, for competitive reasons, I think it\u2019s close to the chest, but we do feel that next fiscal year, we will start seeing much more meaningful revenue. We've been saying that we\u2019re seeing good percentage growth of a relatively smaller number and datacenter as a segment, but in next fiscal year, particularly in the back half, we really see that it's going to start coming together."]], ["And then within communications, if I remember the number correctly, you said it was up 35% year-over-year, but if we go back, could you give us a sense for -- it has to be well below the peak level we saw a few years ago.

It is still, from both of the end markets in communications, it is still meaningfully below the highs we've seen, for both wired and wireless in the past, three and five years ago. But I think also, the other thing to think about it, given the growth of our other end markets, it's a smaller percentage of our overall business. Our overall exposure to that is smaller, but we do expect that we have headroom, as we\u2019ve discussed in both wired and wireless to get past the historic levels at some point in the future."]], ["So how far below are we from that level and now you have more content, so we should expect as we get into the broader 5G rollout, six or eight quarters from now, that number should be higher than what you did in the last build?

", ["Yes. For FY19, again, it\u2019s starting from effectively zero, right, just at the very end of last quarter. So, it will grow on a percentage basis, but we're not saying that to be very material. But through the course of FY20, as I said in my comments, it will be meaningful revenue. I think the interest is high. I do think that how much more upside versus it maybe being a little bit moderate, there is certainly a degree of around some of the things that the early questions around application development, in fact also just education and so forth and that's why we did the Developer\u2019s Forum and hopefully you saw some of the momentum that we are getting in strong interest there, right. So it's early days, but we do feel like the signals are, there's a lot of interest and revenue being meaningful in FY20 timeframe, not FY1."]], ["And then can you put that in the broader context of when you've talked about inorganic growth, is this the type of thing you're looking at, or would you sort of look for more revenue types of opportunity there that are more immediate? ", ["Yeah. Joe, DeePhi, as you probably know since you'd spoken to them, they've been using our platforms since the beginning, and achieving excellent results, (16:06) using their technology. They've grown quite a bit and they have expertise, of course, primarily in the DNN. But also, they got really good expertise in a variety of disciplines, the tools, the compilers, everything.\nSo, it really does segue into the second part of your question, match very well, clearly, I think, with our strategy. Not only because we had applied, of course, all of this technology in the cloud, but as you probably noticed, they actually have a good presence at the edge applications, many different camera applications. And we've already done a fair amount of joint marketing together with them with some of our customers. They've also got, as you'd imagine, good connections and opportunities in China, but we've worked with them very significantly with multinational companies and various different industries, Data Centers, as well as things like automotive. So, it matches really well, and it's a good example. I know people have been asking questions around what our thoughts are on our M&A, and I think this is a good example of how we believe, which we said, right, in the Analyst Day, that anything we would do would have a really strong connection to our stated strategy."]], ["So, could you just expand a little bit more on that, because from what I understand you're actually going to \u2013 at least to us, you will unveil the product at your Developer Forum.\nAnd also, what do these metrics mean when you talk about the number of developers that you are training on AWS? ", ["Sure. Look, as we shared in the Analyst Day, we are going to sell industry standard boards into the Data Center, because it's a very standards-driven form factor, and we see that as a win-win because, of course, we add more value to the customers on our solution. We also speed their ability to get their key IP and differentiation out on the market without having to deal with a lot of the basic system level issues that will build into the board.\nOur internal projections on when that might be, perhaps we will conservative, because it's new territory for us; and what we're just getting is, in the early engagements with customers, quite a strong amount of interest. And our sales team is pretty excited. So, we do expect that will probably come out a little bit stronger than our internal expectations which, to be honest, is relatively modest since we're just getting into it. So, that's one aspect of it.\nI think the other aspect of what does it mean about increasing developers and the investments we made in the applications ecosystem and then, for that matter, the DeePhi acquisition, I mean, we've said all along that while we're seeing good percentage growth in the core Data Center business, it's starting from a small base. So, this year, it's really all about, right, building on the foundation, driving the ecosystem, driving broader understanding, adoption, as well as the development we're working together with us as well as our FAAS partnerships to lower the barrier for use, improving the ease of use. Next year, we definitely think this is going to roll up into more material revenue, and continue the growth path that we do see.\nSo, what you should take away with these other metrics is that we don't want to emphasize the revenue in this year because we are building up that foundation. Again, frankly, on a percentage basis, it's a good sized percentage, but it's starting from a small base. So, what we're trying to share with you \u2013 we got a lot of feedback we're trying to share with you \u2013 other metrics for progress that we're getting, right? So \u2013 and I certainly do think it's meaningful, right, because once these developers are trained on the platform, then over time, you'll see a whole lot more innovation going on on our platform."]], ["I guess the question on Comms, you guided that business, I think, down 7% year on year for fiscal 2019, but I believe you said earlier that all segments would be up now.

", ["So \u2013 hey, Tristan. The observation that the guide is a little bit below where we ended up the second half of the year is correct, but I do think you have to put in perspective that the gross margin levels we attained as a company are really quite good, a result of the value we provide our customers, and how aggressively we're managing the cost side of it. So, we worked real hard. We think the 68.5% to 70.5%, I guess 71%, that we got at Analyst Day is quite strong performance in aggregate. It will move up and down, dependent on mix. But one of the premises you said, that particular Communications business is higher than average, you have to keep in mind we have a portfolio of customers and a portfolio of end markets, and the margin dynamics are very different with each of them. I wouldn't say we're passing up revenue growth opportunities with any sort of margin screen. We aggressively pursue all the business that we think we can get, so.\nVictor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.\nSo, on that last note, let me just comment here that wireless specifically is generally very competitive. And so I don't think if you look at Communications as a whole, including wireless communications, I think the statement that wireless communications tends to be very margin rich is not the appropriate characterization, frankly.\nAnd on the Data Center side, it really depends. You have to remember that when we talk about Data Center, we have opportunities in compute, storage and networking. And depends on what the use case is, there are some good, healthy value that we can hold. In other cases, you have to compete for the business. So, yeah, I'd say that you have to be a little careful about historic, perhaps, margins versus where things are today."]], ["But in terms of revenue opportunity, how much does it, what new TAM does it open up versus cannibalization of existing offerings because we're always worried about that for FPGA companies is how much of the existing business are you cannibalizing? ", ["Yeah I actually think that there'll be significant SAM extension. As I shared when I unveiled ACAP as well as the overall strategy is that one of the goals that we have as a company is to start enabling software developers to use our very powerful platform and the ACAP will definitely give a huge boost to that. We're not waiting for that. I mean we're doing that even today with our 16-nanometer in fact even some of our early products.\nI mean, one way to think about it is, if you think about our Zynq, first generation of Zynq, and then the MPSoC which is the second-generation, that's already getting both TAM expansion as well as some refresh of existing sockets its but definitely already gotten SAM extension. ACAP is kind of a quantum leap beyond the Zynq platforms but you could look at it and say those are the closest (13:18) in terms of generation goes, okay? So I expect significant SAM extension.\nAnd in terms of revenue we're taping out this year and most of the revenue will be out a year beyond that. And, as you know, a lot of our markets take some time to ramp but then product life is quite long."]], ["And then as a quick follow-up, Victor, on your ACAP business I think in the press release you talked about spending about $1 billion in R&D over the past four years on this platform, which obviously, isn't necessarily a small number for you guys. ", ["Well, let me just say. I believe this is the first time we ever kind of shared the level of investment for a particular program. So I'm going to give a little context there. Overall, it's not entirely, I mean, it's not at all unusual that we have to invest a fairly long period of time and prior to tape-out, there's a lot of investment that goes into it even before your very first tape-out. So in that qualitative respect, Everest is no different but on an absolute basis because of the, how powerful that platform is, it's a new product category, there is, on a relative basis, more investment and it is 7-nanometers. So of course, 7-nanometers of advanced technologies is also complex and requires additional investment, but I do want to be clear that it's not like fundamentally different.\nWe have fairly long development cycles, and we have extremely long and robust revenue cycles to go with that. In terms of overall OpEx guide. I think we're going to be discussing at (17:15) where we're going to be at Analyst Day. So I don't think it's appropriate for me to share that at this point. But I would say, I've been pretty consistent in saying, we're always trying to balance the right thing between investing for sustained long-term growth and to an earlier question things like SAM extension but also giving good return to the shareholder. So we always try to do a thoughtful balance of the two."]], ["I just want to ask you in the consumer bucket if you've seen a tailwind from cryptocurrencies, just kind of curious, most of the currencies have fallen off a bit, I was just kind of curious to your outlook of that into June?

I mean, as you know, the last quarter is the first time we ever talked about crypto because it was becoming somewhat material, and we did feel that while it's very volatile, we see that we are supporting those customers, we're trying to, of course, building products and trying to make them successful. But if you recall, we did say that we were talking about low $10 million kind of exposure as opposed to what you guys hear from like the GP world, for instance. I would say nothing's really changed from that. And again, and we all know that it's volatile, so that's also not changed. The number, the volatility's baked into the current guide.

I took over being CEO last April, so really have had sales under me for the full year and while we didn't come out with a strategy statement, I certainly as owning sales and marketing, drove that and then just earlier in the year, we came out very explicitly and said that.\nSo again, you'll hear more at the May Analyst, but absolutely, we have been pushing more aggressively on growth and that's a combination of just doing really well in our core business as well as seeking areas of new growth. The data center continues to be building well, but it's not very material revenue right now and because it's an emerging area it have kind of some friskiness, but we're very happy with them there, but certainly as Lorenzo already covered, a lot of our core businesses, A&D from a year was a record, TME is a record, ISM, industrial was strong. So we have broad strength, and we're going to continue to drive that as hard as we can."]], ["I wonder if I could follow up on the inorganic growth comment and maybe if you could just kind of tell us the scope of things you might think about there.

So one way you can think about it, just within that element of our strategy, we could actually look at potential opportunities at any of those sub-segments.\nNow the second element of strategy is to so accelerate the growth in our core business, so that also \u2013 so I'm not taking in any way taking off the table what may not be on the chess board, things related to some of our core business, okay, but it is going to be driven about what's going to really drive our growth and some of the directional things you want to do. If I look at the third element just talking about in general driving adaptive computing, that's more of a feature kind of a strategy. So it could also be in that sense, you could say, it could also be technologies and things that help drive that.\nSo, yes, again, as you can imagine, of course, I can't give any specifics, but I think we'll be looking quite broadly anything from, which we've done before, talking from technology all the way to actually significant businesses."]], ["I mean, it looks like that's, sorry, you crossed over 10% of revenues at one point in the year, it seems like then drove a health portion of your growth for the year. ", ["Yes. So there's a very important aspect of Zynq that you have to keep in mind, and Victor alluded to it earlier when he was discussing automotive. The first Zynq platforms, our 28-nanometer platforms, we launched, it was a SAM expansion play for us. It opened markets for us that we weren't as well suited for in the past and with a programmable platform we were able to address new markets, and ADAS is a great example of it.\nThen with the second-generation 16-nanometer MPSoC, we're expanding that and reaching into even more markets. So it is a fundamentally market expansion play for us. It took a little bit longer as we've acknowledged in the past for it to ramp than we expected, but it is now, I think, a core part of our product strategy going forward. And because of the nature of Zynq as a platform, we think it's durable and sticky going forward. So we'll continue to expand our markets and it helps us grow with customers as well. Victor, you want to add anything?\nVictor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.\nYes, no. I mean, again, I think the key thing that we're seeing, as I mentioned, this thing of platforms, we're seeing that cut across all segments, frankly. No one's doing, deploying single customized solutions, everybody's moving to platforms. And again, I think its part of the overall thrust of things wanting to be intelligent as well as connected, and so based on that even companies that traditionally have done point solutions aren't doing that. So I think Zynq is just an ideal turning point system core product for those kind of platform architectures."]], ["How should we think about sustainability of that given the increase in the next node and that's been the case forever but it seems like a step jump in that and also you're spending more on the FPGA as a Service model.

So in terms of the way the segment came out, we had really strong growth in segments for which we generally have very good value. Of course it's more complicated that, there's a lot of things we're doing for controlling the COGS and so forth. So I would say we absolutely can excuse me, I was referring to gross margin but in terms of the operating margin obviously that's all true but, so at that level in terms of operating margin. I think we've been very careful about investing where we see bigger returns and also being mindful of where we are on the gross margin line.\nSo I think that we're going to be balancing those things right. We generally give a range of the upper 60s up into the 70s and I think if we look at how return we would get by investing further we'll do that aggressively and other places we absolutely want to give return to the shareholders, so.\nMoshe Gavrielov\nSo Ambrish, I'm going to think maybe I'm going to ramp some other questions on this. We're - I guess outside of tax which I'll help you guys out a little bit on for the future. We're going to stick with our traditional cadence of providing specific financial guidance initially in our Q4 earnings call and then more in detail at our analyst day.

Look on the one hand, we are creating a lot of value, where our products, our leadership not only because we've executed well and delivered what we said but we've done innovations the most recent one for instance the RFSoC, where we integrated RF class data converters monolithically whereas 16-nanometer digital process. Right. Where that's saving the customer power, cost, size, weight all these things. And some of the other areas we have the larger capacity by factor.

So but crypto currency side, well of course consumer to the extent that we play is more price challenges, more margin leanness other places that we play in aerospace and defense for instance so forth and in general if you're delivering value you can get the value.

Okay, it's not secret there's so much involved there that people doing custom ASICs for this and they're also using GPUs. Now the reason why we do see some flip here is because it's a very dynamic situation to a different and Bitcoin gets a lot of press, but really there is multiple different currencies and there is lot of things happening, so with that kind of change the flexibility we have that has that value. But we are very cautious here because of the volatility of it and we don't want to you to over read in what we're saying, right?

We don't believe there is any susceptibility to the meltdown aspect of it. Regarding Spectre there is no known susceptibility in terms of the 16-nanometer Zynq MPSoC and in terms of the first generation Zynq SoC, we use there the ARM Cortex A-9 which has the possibility of having some of that however I'll point out that, most of our customers do and closed embedded systems. And if that's the case that's highly unlikely that there will be exposure to that.\nIn addition if the customer does have something to get, gets user kind of code exposure if they use authentication, security features that are there then that exposure is also same thing highly unlikely. We haven't heard anything from customers but of course we monitor that very closely and we're working with ARM very closely on any further news or mitigation. Just to round out the basis, by the way we've had our proprietary Microblaze SoC [ph] embedded processor. We know that there is no vulnerability there in that architecture is very simplistic so there is no vulnerability in either of the Meltdown or the Spectre. Does that?"]], ["Moshe, I\u2019m hoping you can help us sort of align what we hear as very good traction in the early stages of these deep learning projects by the web scale providers on the one hand versus sales coming in a little bit lower than expected in that end market for the quarter, and perhaps some effervescent optimism about that end market? ", ["Actually, sales didn\u2019t come less than expected; they came where they were expected. If you look at communications on a whole, wireless was down but data center business was up. But, we are at the very, very early stages of deployment of this technology. And it takes series of time, typically years from when the deployment starts to when the potential is realized. As such, what we are directing everyone is to $200 million to $300 million in calendar year 2020, and that\u2019s still a plan and we are on plan to deliver that number. It just takes this length of time. The biggest impediment we had was expanding the potential customer base. And programmable logic in the past has been directed only at hardware designers. And in order to make it available to a broader audience, we have developed this SDAccel capability that is now being deployed. That should enable the adopters beyond the traditional existing users of our technology and that will -- that gives us confidence in the potential of achieving the $200 million to $300 million.\nBut patience is important on this because it just takes time until it has that viral impact. And the broad acceptance by, by far the biggest things we think is huge stepping stone towards that. And as the -- that together with the SDAccel are the enablers. And over time, we do expect to see this translate into revenue at a faster rate, but we have been very clear with regards to setting expectations as to when that will happen and we continue to project the $200 million to $300 million in the 2020 timeframe. It\u2019s the right thing to plan [ph] at this point."]], ["Looking at data center, are you seeing interest from anybody for a Xilinx FPGA becoming the first access point in the data center, basically delegating the CPU as a second integral? ", ["If it become any time soon, the first one, then my $200 million to $300 million would be ridiculously low number. And so, what is happening is a transition, which is now accelerating in the industry and it\u2019s a transition where CPUs have basically exhausted their ability or have only minimal ability to provide higher performance to these very parallel applications. As a result, there is this transition to heterogeneous architectures, which have a CPU and have other forms of acceleration. GPUs have been pursuing that several years now and now it\u2019s very significant business for the GPU vendors. And programmable logic has emerged as a third alternative. But, we don\u2019t expect it to supplant CPUs totally. And that\u2019s -- but it will provide a very significant enhancement for this heterogeneous computing and will provide an alternative and that it\u2019s not that CPUs will go away but there\u2019ll be a need for less CPUs for some of these applications and they will be replaced by other modes of acceleration in particular programmable logic over time."]], ["I believe this was roughly a 5% business for you guys in fiscal 2017, curious if you think this could be a 10 plus percent business over the next two to three years. ", ["So, let me start from the last question, or the last sub question that you asked. We are seeing in ADAS transition from our original Zynq product to our MPSoC, which is the 16-nanometer generation, pickup there has been quite substantial. And quite a lot of the customers are now deploying the second or third generation, which is in 16-nanometer and we expect that to be a big growth driver for us going forward. We do expect this market to provide double-digit growth per year with the potential for that continuing for next few years. And that\u2019s just with the -- for the deployment of ADAS and the new generation of ADAS, and then early versions of automated -- autonomous driving, which will have very powerful, centralized control unit, but then will continue to have a lot of additional auxiliary technology required to implement the solution. And we will likely play significant role in the second part. We are not differing the first ultra-high performance processing portion of it. And so, if you look at the arithmetic, could it get to 10%? Yes, it\u2019s sort of moving that direction but I think it has a few years ahead of it to deliver on that potential.\nLorenzo Flores\nJust to clarify, C.J., was your question on 16-nanometer related to the broader adoption or just in ADAS?"]], ["Last month, at your developer forum, I think in the keynote, the gentleman from the AWS gave a very constructive and positive commentary on your offerings and how they would expand that business going forward? ", ["We would need to see broad adoption, and that tends to be viral, so you get the early adopters, we start using it, some of them start seeing superior results. It generates some excitement, and then you start getting more and more of these application developers. And I think, the key metric will be when will we see the next acceleration in the application developer. Realistically that couldn\u2019t happen up to now because it was limited to FPGA designers with SDAccel and all of the additional things we are doing. We now have provided the foundation for that. And expectation is that it will feed upon itself, once they start seeing superior results in terms of acceleration. And so that will be the thing to watch. And I think the fact that you are seeing Huawei and Alibaba within less than a year jumping in and following in Amazon\u2019s footsteps that is a proof that there is a lot of potential here, because you now have three very significant players providing this as a service. Amazon obviously started a year ahead of everyone and is still way ahead of everyone, at this point, but the others are going to pursue them with vigor, as you can tell from their announcement. And the expectation is that the applications, which will benefit from this -- from parallelism, which is inherent and available, and programmable logic will be the driver for expansion of this, both in the cloud and over time in embedded applications too."]], ["Quickly, Lorenzo, going back to the OpEx and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I thought that this year was going to be a relatively tan [ph] year for tape-outs and that would have been a tailwind for OpEx reductions and what sort of offset that was some of the software development work you needed to go after new application acceleration. ", ["I think the best way to think about OpEx with respect to those new applications and in general is, go back to the guidance we have provided for the full year, which is going to be between 990 and 1010 millions of dollars for the year in terms of OpEx. Take the guidance I just gave and add to it the first couple of quarters, we are right around $750 million of OpEx for the year. We are going to be -- going to be in our range. We\u2019ve accommodated both the new investments that you talked about with respect to software development and our tape-out schedule. The comment I made around tape-out was explaining why this particular quarter we\u2019re going to see OpEx go up and then go back down in Q4.\nMoshe Gavrielov\nAnd the current tape outs are due to 16-nanometer going to production and happening faster than we had expected, plus a few additional expansion products like the RFSoC, which was sort of new. And so, it was never expected to be the low tape-out there. And the reason that it\u2019s a high tape-out here is the technology is doing so well or relatively high tape-out, the technology is doing so well and it\u2019s in such pristine condition that we are now rolling out the entire product offering, and that\u2019s why we have 34 unique products already shipping. And that\u2019s been -- you multiple that 34 number by several million dollars for each tape out. That\u2019s sort of an expensive occasion.

", ["Actually, you\u2019ve framed the question quite well, John in that. So, maybe, we are little too elliptical when we are talking about our -- the strength in our consumer business. We do see -- we do have meaningful business with some of the crypto currency providers, like you said the role our product plays, which is typically a Zynq-based product is as a controller, if you will for these ASIC-based mining platforms. We don\u2019t -- at the same time, we say that we acknowledge this meaningful business in this quarter. We obviously want to see some longevity in that business and breadth of that business before we point it out as a key driver. We are really happy with it right now but we don\u2019t want to get a little bit overheated in talking about the potential for this. We do, as I said, I\u2019ll go back to same words, some longevity in that business and some breadth across multiple customers for that business for us."]], ["It seems like you are competitor, Intel, has recently increased their focus on 10-nanometer, and it seems a little surprising given the issues, the well-known issues they\u2019re having with 14, the conversation has shifted to 10 at this point. ", ["Well, we have accelerated 16-nanometer very significantly, and that the significant number tape-outs this year were to move it all into production. That\u2019s where we believe we have the broad leadership at the current nodes. And so, I think we\u2019re in violent agreement with you on that front, as our customers. We are working feverously on our 7-nanometer solution with TSMC. We expect to tape that out next year. And we are very pleased with the progress that TSMC has made. And I was just at their 30-year anniversary and they\u2019re full steam ahead. We are -- very, very, very big mobile customers of sort of standing in line, they are all there and they are targeting their next generation 7-nanometer and we will be immediately after them, taping out our devices and benefiting from the huge learning that that volume will run through the system. So, in this business, if you ever stand still, you are likely to have the tortoise and hare scenarios. So, we are running as quickly as we can to make sure that we continue to exploit our leadership and prolong it into the next generation. For us that is taping out next year and it is going to be a phenomenally attractive generation of technology."]], ["And I'm wondering, given your success that you're getting in Zynq and embedded SoC, are you starting to see your competition becoming more the ASICs and ASSP players, or are you still see your competition is traditional FPGA? ", ["Okay. Well, that's a great question. And indeed, you're right. And actually this is an ongoing transition which is happening. And as our devices are becoming more and more sophisticated, they're all in the systems exchanging. And whereas in the past, the programmable logic for the FPGAs used to have a relatively well-defined role, but it was more of a auxiliary capability. Now, these All Programmable have very sophisticated SoCs with highly integrated programmable logic of moving to the center of the customer's system. And now, because we're using this technology and it's happening in conjunction with the transition to heterogeneous computing, right, which is people moving beyond the traditional computing models to others where there's a need for parallelism, we have a very good match with a lot of these new applications. And in particular, if you look at machine learning and artificial intelligence, that sort of the killer application which transcends all of these and actually can be very well addressed by our solution.\nAs a result of that, we definitely are seeing very different competition. I would say that the market is about 60% in terms of revenue is in our more traditional historic competition, but there are \u2013 actually there's less players in that market, and I'm not only talking about Altera, which is now part of Intel, but you're seeing less and less competition in those markets like A&D, Broadcast and the like. They really are seeing less competition because that's very fragmented, and test and measurement is another example of those.\nAnd then about 40% what we're seeing, and this is very market specific, we're seeing different competitors. So, if you look at wired, the biggest competitor would be Broadcom and in some case high-end ASICs. And if you look at wireless, it's more ASICs than anything else, and a solution for that is the high level of integration with our RFSoC.\nYou look at things like Automotive and Data Center, then what you see is the big semiconductor companies there, and they are addressing it through their SoC-based solutions. And the way we're attacking it is not frontally, it's based on our strengths because we believe that the ability to use the programmable logic as the differentiator is a key element, which is very difficult to duplicate any other way.\nAnd so, we're addressing those markets there. But it is a very different and competitive map and it was \u2013 it's also one which requires us to invest a lot in ease of use, and that's the biggest knock on our technology in the past whereas it would only work with hardware designers, and a lot of these companies don't even have hardware designers or have very small teams, and that's why the SDAccel and SDSoC products were so important, and those are the things that Lorenzo highlighted.\nThe Amazon deployment of this technology not only will benefit our business with the hyper-scalers but actually will enable us to compete on a broader base in all of these markets against other SoC providers.\nNext question, please?"]], ["Moshe, I just wanted to clarify something, and I'm not expecting your AI-related business to grow overnight, but I just wanted to revisit something you said a few quarters ago and are we still on track for that. ", ["So, no, there's seven hyper-scalers, and then there's also two significant systems companies that are very close customers and partners. You can look at our release and you can sort of figure out the people who are in CCIX. CCIX is the protocol which addresses and is targeted at \u2013 particularly, this market addresses this area.\nSo, as you look at those, the tens of millions of dollars do not require massive adoption by additional players. It's sort of \u2013 it's based on what we believe and, for better or for worse, this is the way it's panning out, but this is based on the existing business we have with numerous players, which is going to be relatively small, the business with AWS, which I think will carry the bulk of this. And then any of the other players, and we're working with all of the other six hyper-scalers and these two system-level companies who are pursuing these businesses, which is to be cloud-based providers, they're likely to contribute, but not significantly this year, right?\nAnd that's \u2013 and as they come on and as the AWS potential deployment increases significantly, then that's what sort of enables us to grow beyond these numbers. But there's nothing in those tens of millions of dollars which sort of assumes huge design wins translating to revenue other than the ones that you're sort of aware of. And the Baidu one generally belongs in that other category. We're not counting on it yet for this \u2013 for our fiscal year 2018 numbers."]], ["Are you picking up that your competitor has anything like this?\nAnd the third one, Moshe, I believe last earnings call, you mentioned that you were not quite \u2013 it was a bit of a surprise, correct me if I'm wrong, but it was a bit of a surprise that you learned kind of late that AWS was working on this. ", ["Okay. So, three questions is normally one more than I can remember. So if I might ask you to step in. But the initial deployment, they started the deployment at the beginning of the year, and that was an internal deployment which was just accessible to their hardware design team. The GA, which was on April 19, was a Vivado-oriented deployment. And that again is targeted at customers who have traditional hardware design \u2013 designers. And the new one, which we expect to be rolled out over the next month or so, is the one which has SDAccel. So, you are right, the first one was Vivado. And now, the new one will be SDAccel, targeting software developers.\nWith regard to the nine players who are targeting these markets, most of them are not looking at FPGA-as-a-Service and they're actually looking more at providing acceleration capabilities as part of their cloud-based footprint, but to enable their business as opposed to making a business of it. But having said that, there are quite a few who are looking at making a business of it, and I'm not at liberty of saying who is and who isn't. But obviously, Amazon is a tremendous homing beacon for quite a few of these. And some of them have announced capabilities but no one is anywhere close to where Amazon is in terms of the level of deployment.\nAnd then the middle question...\nLorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.\nDoes the competitor have anything like SDAccel?\nMoshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.\nDoes the competitor have anything like SDAccel? I'm sure they're convinced they do. But truth is that this is technology which, at the core, is some unique proprietary synthesis technology, which we believe we're the only people in the world that have that. So we believe that this sort of approach is maybe not limited to us, but we have, by far, the best, the highest likelihood of being successful there.\nThat doesn't, to be totally honest, doesn't eliminate them as a competitor because they can try to address it in other ways, which are maybe more limited and maybe don't give the same benefits, but they can sort of try to do that. And I'm sure that that, to the extent that they're interested in pursuing it, that's the most likely way that they will, in which case we will have likely a very strong competitive advantage on that, too. And so that's the third of the three.\nNext question, please?"]], ["Moshe, you mentioned something when talking about AWS, it was interesting to me, you were saying that you're working arm in arm or shoulder to shoulder, I guess, with the engineers there.

", ["Okay. Well, I'll do my best. But realistically, we're going to provide a lot more information on this topic on May 22. So I encourage you to look for more detail then. But generally speaking, first and foremost, the most valuable element we have is actually in the flexibility, and that is inherent to the programmable logic, and that is something which is very, very, very difficult to provide in an ASIC. And similarly, it's quite difficult to provide in a similar way at least using a CPU and a GPU. And the importance of flexibility is that even though it sort of sounds like machine learning and inferencing and all of that, we are into the 70th year of hearing about it.\nReality is it's an emerging technology with very broad applicability where the benchmarks are very dynamic and the ones which are important today are going to be likely totally useless two or three years from now. And the biggest benefit we have is the fact that our devices can be programmed to match the new payloads and new algorithms, right. Now, so that's sort of the generic thing, and I think everyone sort of misses that, and that's why I'm starting with this long semi-diatribe on this issue because that sort of is something that I think the market underestimates the inherent advantage we have there.\nNow, if you sort of look at a specific set of applications, generally speaking, on things which do not require floating point, we tend to have higher performance and lower power than all other options. Now, if you take one fixed application and you target a dedicated ASIC to it, yes, I'm sure they can do better, but then if anything changes then that ASIC all of a sudden becomes a lot less attractive on the new application, whereas the programmable logic can be modified to adapt to that. And so generally speaking, we have much better performance than CPUs and GPUs for everything except floating point for each application and we have performance which is generally on par to a fixed but actually the biggest benefit is in the flexibility of our products and the fact they can be adapted.\nWith regards to specific benchmarks we can share the numbers we have with you, and we would be happy to do that. And this is one of the reasons that we're so excited about this market. And if you sort of look at Amazon in addition to the inherent technology advantage we provide, it actually provides us with a perfect conduit to a very broad set of new customers.

Just to remind you, we \u2013 typically takes a very long period of time from when we introduce the technology to when it actually provides huge revenue. And an example would be 28- nanometer, which is still not at its peak and we actually think that it\u2019s a minimum of 2 years, maybe even further away from its peak. Now, if you look at 20 and 16 together, we tend to look at them as one node just due to the way they were introduced. They came relatively close together. And the combination of those \u2013 these two nodes is doing very well across all markets. 16, it\u2019s still early days. We have these 300 customers and 12 unique devices that are shipping, but none of the customers are yet in volume production. You are right in highlighting that 16, two of the markets that will unquestionably drive that are automotive and data center. They are not the only two markets. They actually had much broader applicability. And of the two \u2013 those two data center tends to happen a little faster than automotive, but data center for us is a nascent market. It\u2019s very early in its development and that\u2019s why we are very careful in highlighting that the investments we are making in data center now will likely pay off a few years down the road, and we sort of highlighted 2020 is when it will be substantial in the potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. So to answer on 16-nanometer, overall, I would be disappointed in 2 years if it isn\u2019t well over $100 million worth of business. Which markets will constitute that $100 million of sales, it\u2019s still early to tell. And for this year, it will be significant, but it won\u2019t be at that $100 million for this fiscal year for sure.\nLorenzo Flores\nAnd the other part with the OpEx trajectory?\nMoshe Gavrielov\nSure.\nLorenzo Flores\nOkay. So C.J., I think I\u2019ll just echo a little bit of what Moshe said in response to Ambrish\u2019s question, which is we will obviously provide more details coming out of our fiscal year and at our Analyst Day. But I think that what we said in the past is what we are thinking now, which is we don\u2019t expect the slope of the R&D investment to be at the same angle as this past year and we are managing the company to get back to the 30% up and greater operating margin level in the intermediate term, if you will."]], ["And then secondly, now that you have put all the spending on the OpEx side in fiscal \u201816 \u2013 fiscal \u201817, sorry, how should we think about OpEx trajectory into fiscal \u201818? ", ["Okay. Let me do \u2013 I will try to answer your first part of your question probably a little differently than the way you had asked it.

", ["Yes. So John, I certainly understand both why you asked the question and how you kind of framed it, but I will go back to something Moshe has said and we are going to try very hard to stick to over the next 3 months. We want to provide you a much clearer view of what our 2018, or FY 2018 looks like as we come out of this fiscal year and into our Analyst Day. But I will address a couple of your points may be to help you out in the interim. We do have, as you noted, significant increase in the second half of the year from tape-outs that we are taking advantage of our leadership position and we think it was the right thing to do. We told you we are going to do it at our last Analyst Day and as we are doing it. We are also growing our overall R&D capability. So, those are factors we are going to have to balance as well as what we are doing on the next nodes in the next fiscal year. And I think it\u2019s probably more beneficial to your understanding of our operating model next year to wait rather than try to guess at it right now."]], ["And then Moshe maybe as my follow-up, notwithstanding your comments earlier about putting expectations around acceleration, just given what we are seeing going on in the GPU market right now and the uptake of GPU to the data center, given that it would seem that the FPGA architecture in a lot of instances for acceleration applications might actually be superior, what is it that that\u2019s allowing GPU uptick to be faster than FPGA uptake for these applications in the data center in the near term? ", ["You are absolutely right. This was identified as a growth market by the GPU companies primarily NVIDIA, a long, long time ago and I give them credits for identifying that in their desire to diversify beyond their core PC and gaming focus, they invested very heavily on the software front. What we are doing is we are now taking a page out of their book. It\u2019s not necessarily the same page. It\u2019s a little bit of a different page. And we have to do that in order to enable broader deployment fundamentally, because the customer base \u2013 the target customer base is not FPGA savvy and it\u2019s very unlikely that they will become FPGA savvy. Hence, you need this higher level of abstraction. And so the core benefits in the silicon architecture are there and we are continuing to drive those in all of the current generations. Some of the customers have the capability to deliver on that by themselves. Some of them need quite a bit of help and we are providing that through things like this rest architecture solution, which should make it easier for them to access the technology. Now as that is done and then you can look at some unique deployments like the Amazon one is unique and that it\u2019s FPGA as a service, as we support that effort to enable them to expand the markets that could have a significant leverage with regards to the breadth of people who have access to it. That\u2019s why we are so excited. That\u2019s why we are getting some benefit from probably the biggest customer in the world and their business model and their approach to doing this. So that could, as it gets deployed and it\u2019s brought to the market successfully that could accelerate this entire process. So between that and the rest architecture, I think those are the things that we believe will enable us to get to market much faster. And it won\u2019t take us the same period of time, but it took other competitors in the past to develop this market."]], ["If I can get one follow-up, please, in the ADAS market, the big sort of category that I am aware of is this sort of hovering view stitching together for a camera corner view in some orders, but I am suspecting maybe it\u2019s much more diverse and at the minimum, you might have some sensor fusion applications, could you comment on the diversity of the design wins and the pace of ramps in those ADAS application? ", ["Okay. So you are right that this is emerging and it\u2019s emerging very, very quickly. And the needs are quite fluid and they are growing and there are different requirements. And so there is a broad set of design wins, which address different approaches. And sensor fusion is sort of a buzzword for highlighting that there is a whole family of different sensors that are required, some of which point forward, some of which point inward, some of which point sideways, some of which point backward. And this market is evolving at a very, very fast rate. What we are seeing is due to be uncertainty in the market and the \u2013 and due to the fact that for automotive, it\u2019s moving, it\u2019s an unprecedented upgrade [ph]. There is a lot of uncertainty, and that\u2019s where we believe we have tremendous benefit because our solutions tend to enable a lot of flexibility as the markets change. And we are seeing that the major benefit with regards to competition with other companies that have a more ASSP oriented rigid solution. And we are seeing just a broad range of these different approaches and the design wins actually fall into numerous categories for us that \u2013 and enable us to address a lot of these. The early mover advantage we had here is helping us, because we have the relationships and it\u2019s already approaching 10% of our business, which actually makes this one of the biggest players in this market. Just don\u2019t have the marketing budget to sort of spray that over the Super Bowl, but we are doing really well."]], ["And then how do we think about the acceleration sort of a growth developing in the near-term, because our thought process was that was perhaps going to be more a 2018, 2019 event relative to the Analyst Day you guys had earlier in the year? ", ["John, it\u2019s next couple of years, it\u2019s not the next couple of quarters. We believe that this has the potential of being $200 million to $300 million by 2020. And it will have to grow to that number. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight and it won\u2019t happen over the next six months. It\u2019s going to take more than six months just for these devices to go into volume production. So this is a - as most of our businesses, this grows a little faster, but it still will take time and will take several years till it gets to the several hundreds of millions of dollars.\nSo the - let\u2019s put it this way, this will not generate the Q4 upswing that you asked about earlier."]]]
