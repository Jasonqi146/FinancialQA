I'll actually be going to the Star Alliance meeting on Mother's Day, which my wife doesn't appreciate, but it's in Germany. And the focus of the meeting is to talk about how we can create a more seamless experience for our customers and really have the focus to be on customers.\nAnd we think there's a big opportunity there, and that's something that we'll be working on over the coming years. But our partnerships are really important, and we're looking forward to expanding partnerships, particularly in Latin America with Avianca and Copa, and we think there's a real opportunity.

", ["Well, I think that there's opportunity on both. At United, and I said this at my previous airline, roughly half of our revenue is coming from infrequent customers and half is coming from premium customers, customers that fly as often.\nAnd it's a little over simplistic to say that, that half of revenue coming from infrequent customers just cares about price because a lot them care about more than that. It's also -- the flip side is true that some of our frequent customers are really shopping on price as well. But at a high level, you can think of it simplistically as half and half and we need to fuel both.\nAnd that's the wonderful thing about Basic Economy. It is giving our customers choice. So, for those customers who do care about price -- and by the way, at launch this morning, we had a couple of flights go out and smooth and we're encouraged with the initial launch from Minneapolis today.\nBut for our customers who want a lower price, it's fantastic that we can give them that. And for customers who want a higher level of service and who are willing to pay for a higher level of service and a better product, we can give them that as well.\nThis is all about giving our customers' choice, and I think it will happen on both ends. It will make our product more attractive to customers. We are focused on getting the absolute lowest rock-bottom price, and it will also attract customers who would like to have a better level of service and a better product and are willing to pay for that."]], ["And now that you've had a chance to review the network and maybe adoption rates to increase connectivity, are you still thinking that the regional fleet will be flattish after the year-end 2017 levels?

To be clear, we wouldn't be flying them in places like Dulles to Chicago or Newark to Atlanta. We will be flying them in places like Rochester, Minnesota, where they're more appropriate.\nSo our regional fleet is less about -- our regional lift is going to be less about our optimal network strategy and much more about our regional partners' ability to source aircraft and pilots, in particular.\nWe -- as a general rule, most of those deals are trading down over time, and we are losing aircraft. That's one of the great things about the Air Wisconsin deal is we were able to go get aircraft that are going to come in at a price that's kind of right in the middle of our prices on other deals, so it's attractive economics and to a large degree, will offset some of the shrinking that we expect to occur at our other regional partners.\nAnd we're hoping that our other regional partners can actually keep flying some of those aircraft longer. In fact, SkyWest, [Indiscernible], our numbers have gone up for aircraft at the end of the year because it turns out they're going to be able to fly some of those aircraft a little longer than we thought. But at the end of the day, it's going to be driven -- our regional count -- aircraft count is going to be driven much more by the pilot availability than it is by our optimal fleet plan."]], ["Scott, when you were at American, you embarked on a hub rebanking effort, which I think, in general, leads to a slightly higher-cost operation exchanged -- in exchange for higher revenue.

I would point at American to Dulles, which had all the craziness going on with the Wright Amendment and the growth of Spirit, all that just huge headwinds, and yet Dulles was outperforming consistently on PRASM quarter after quarter because of the higher levels of connectivity. So, I'm not sure what the CASM number will be, but I'm highly confident that the increase in revenue will more than offset the PRASM hit."]], ["As we think about your normal market share in your hubs, and I recognize every hub is going to be different, but how does the -- I mean, does your 2020 margin goals specifically require a level of pricing power that's unattainable unless you increase share by, I don't know, more than 5%, 10%? ", ["Well, look, I don't think of it as market share driving pricing power. I think of it more as 2 things: one, driving higher levels of connectivity. When we don't have these higher levels, we have lower levels of connectivity that's high yield [Technical Difficulty] that's completely missing from the network and just giving to your competitors.\nAnd second, places like -- let's just take Newark because I talk about it a lot. We have a Newark-based global services or 1K customer, and we started flying the regional jet to Atlanta and regional jets to Dulles and regional jets to Detroit. We pushed that global services customer, who is a high-yield customer, who booked at the last minute to fly on Delta and American in those markets.\nAnd beyond that, that customer used to just be a Newark-based customer that was on American -- or United Airlines' frequent flyer program and flew exclusively on United. But now, all of a sudden, anywhere they flew, they decided to go shop because we forced them to carry free frequent flyer cards in their wallet, and because of that, they're no longer global services because they didn't fly on United all the time. We lost those customers.\nSo it's not about pricing power. It's about winning back the loyalty and giving a better product to our best customers so that they choose and want to fly United Airlines.

If we did, the difference in valuation would be much -- or the difference in the numbers that you cited would be much smaller. And so as we mentioned, we're going to work to find a way to disclose this really valuable business in a way that people can understand better because it is unique and very attractive.\nI think the question you asked about driving incremental revenue, I don't think that's limited to simply MileagePlus members. We communicate with a lot of customers, we carry a lot of customers, we have a lot of this on the website. And we've talked a lot about different ways we can monetize or do a better job of monetizing the eyeballs that reach our website and the members of our mileage program and how to enhance our mileage program.\nSo, I think that, that hasn't been the first priority. We're focused on the things we talked about at Investor Day, which were kind of foundational. But it is the focus of ours, and we've had a number of discussions and at some point, we will really put a lot more time and effort into backsliding the opportunity there, which we do agree with you it exist and is quite substantial but really hard to quantify it."]], ["But from an investor perspective, I think, Scott, what folks are worried about here is that we saw the capacity increase domestically in the past month, one and a half.\nThe concern here is that maybe we're a little bit more focused on market share than margins. ", ["Well, look, we used the term -- I try to avoid actually market share and try to say natural share more often than market share because this is not a play to go get market share. This is really about restoring United to its natural share. And United get a lot -- took a lot of accidents in the past three to four years, which caused it to lose its natural share and which hurt its financials.\nAnd you guys used to get on this earnings call and beat them up about why aren't your financials good. And you gave them a cure for that, which was cut capacity, cut capacity, cut capacity and it just made the problem worse.\nAnd despite taking the same medicine quarter-after-quarter as the numbers got worse and worse and worse that was part of the problem when the airline was cutting capacity and taking regional jets out of places that set the network like Rochester, Minnesota and redeploying them in places like Newark to Atlanta, in order to keep capacity low. That was driving margins lower.\nAnd so I'm trying to be careful to say what we're doing is restoring United to its natural market share, to a position it was in the past, and it's working so far. I mean, it's actually working faster even than I would have thought, the fact that our guidance with this cutting capacity is for RASM up 1% to 3%.\nAnd by the way, we've got number of issues that are driving about -- our flown PRASM is actually higher than that. We've got some accounting issues that are going to be 50 to 70 basis points headwind in this quarter. Those are just the things that happened, but our core performance is even stronger.\nI mean, we just -- early on, we feel really good about how well this is working. It's logical. This is not trying to go invade someone's hub. This is about restoring United to where it should've been and we had some unforced errors. And we were double faulting and giving points to the competitors, and we've stopped double faulting and that, I think, is just going to be getting us back to our natural market share. I don't think it's disruptive. I wouldn't describe the reason that we're doing as disruptive. We're just returning to where United's natural market shares.\nWe're going to be very careful to calibrate how it's working and how we're doing. We're only a few months into this, but I tell you, we're off to a really good start. We won't be perfect, we'll stumble. I mean we had a stumble last week in operations. We'll have stumbles on the commercial side, but we feel really good about the trajectory that we're on.\nOscar Munoz\nAnd I would just add, Brandon, and reiterate what I think I said a couple of times publicly. This is a thoughtful approach with lots of team members involved. Andrew Nocella has just joined us, and joined the team and is really in charge of most of that day in and day out.\nSo really thoughtful, but at the same time opportunistic because it is a unique opportunity as Scott outlined that we have and the list of opportunities continues to be a fairly large one, how we do it in a thoughtful balanced way is sort of the course of the day. But I can tell you that market share is not a conversation we have in this room or with our board, it is all about margin. And so, again, I just want to reiterate that point."]], ["As you're thinking about this plan to grow domestic capacity, nearly 6% in the June quarter, it would be great to hear from you, your level of involvement in that aggressive plans, what preparations you've made, what lead times look like for staffing and training.

That doesn't mean quarter-to-quarter because there's going to be fuel price spikes and there's going to be fuel price decline and there's going to be timing of labor deals at our airline or other airlines.\nBut we look at our relative and absolute margins, and we look at it over kind of a trailing 12-month period, and it adjust for things like fuel hedge losses. And those numbers look like we're doing a good job today, and we feel pretty confident. We believe that, that's going to work going forward.\nI mean, you look at least relative to Delta. In the first quarter, we had higher RASM, better CASM performance, so a lot of other moving pieces in that hedge losses and things that make the numbers a little hard to look at. But that would imply that we're closing the margin gap. Expect we will do so; continue to do so as we move through the rest of the year.\nAnd we just -- we feel really good about the path that we're on. We think we are moving towards sustainably closing both the absolute improvement in margins and relative to RASM gap, but that's what we're going to look at and we're not waiting for you to look at that, we're looking at that every day.\nOscar Munoz\nAnd I would just cap it off with that that is big component of our long-term compensation plan."]], ["Any color there specifically if you can expand on how you are seeing kind of Medicaid progress from a cost and risk pool rate perspective as you kind of come into 2020 that will be really helpful as well?

Tim Noel, can you add some color on some of the other questions?\nTim Noel\nYes, good morning A.J. Thanks for the question. And first off, some of that CMS partial AEP reporting can be a little bit misleading. And Dave said, first and foremost, we want to reiterate the confidence in our full year enrollment growth that we shared at investor conference for MA. And just to revisit that briefly, we said 500,000 to 550,000 Medicare Advantage growth in the M&R business, which includes both group and individual MA and we also said that would be up to 700,000 in MA growth, including duals lifting our community and state business. So when AEP completes, we will have grown by 370,000 in individual MA, including the duals that are in CNS and that\u2019s up 140% over last year\u2019s AEP and is our strongest performance ever in the annual enrollment period. We expect this to drive full year results about 700,000 member growth in individual MA and that\u2019s split on January net growth versus the rest of the year is roughly 50-50 and that\u2019s consistent with the historical pacing and also full year supported by the momentum that we have seen in AEP. With respect to group, you are right, group MA contracted modestly in the CMS reporting. When January all settles out, we expect that to be down about 65, but that will strengthen to flat to down 25 as the year closes out.

But on ESRD, we are very supportive of the change that goes into a fact that on 2021 and encouraged by the opportunity to serve more people. We are not concerned with some of the unknown elements around the reimbursement and payment idles. We will learn those details very soon. We remain confident and expecting that those models will be fair, adequate. And importantly, we believe that these people will be better served in Medicare Advantage. And also important to keep in mind, we served 40,000 Medicare Advantage enrollees with ESRD today that developed a disease post enrollment. And our focus of these members is both on prevention and also on treatment. So we are pleased to have the opportunity to expand our reach and impact with patients that have the disease at the time of enrollment. With respect to social determinants, we continue to have that be a key focus of our business consistently referring folks into insider programs where appropriate and some of the additional flexibility our apply social determinants and plan design are elements that we are leveraging in some of our demonstration projects in 2020. We are excited to learn a little bit more about this as the year progresses and look for more opportunities to do things in this area in 2021.\nDavid Wichmann\nThe last one was physician direct contracting fee-for-service Medicare.\nBrian Thompson\nRight. Hey, Peter. Brian Thompson here. We are very encouraged by that as well. I think similar to what we have done with the bundled payment program it\u2019s a good opportunity to work on advancing traditional Medicare and we are encouraged by that thinking and creativity and look forward to participating.\nDavid Wichmann\nAnd I might add overall, Peter, that we are bullish obviously overall on the outlook for both Medicare Advantage, but also the dual special needs marketplace as well. They are both very larger today and growing in markets. MA is clearly outperforming fee-for-service in terms of overall benefit coverages and the quality of outcomes and the returns that people are getting in terms of their overall satisfaction.

It was really driving OptumCare which is clearly the central part of OptumHealth. As we see physicians move toward taking more risk, we see improvements across the board in terms of resource allocation, prevention, focus, ensuring clinical outcome is maximized. We are very encouraged by that trend. This year alone we would expect about 150,000 more patients to go into our physician risk managed programs across OptumCare. We continue to see that trend accelerate. It\u2019s very much something that we then anchored the build out of the rest of our OptumHealth portfolio around. So in a sense, is that thoughtfulness around how can we then create services inside data analytics which held the position, made the best possible judgment to manage the overall risk profile of the patient. You see that then reflected in the relentless growth of the revenue per patient served across OptumHealth. That\u2019s really being driven by this shift. And so you are absolutely right, very important element for us and it essentially becomes the core around which we then envision and build our support services, our interventions and our analytics to empower the physicians to make the best possible decision on behalf of the patients. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann\nI might just add to that just slightly, Josh, that UnitedHealthcare is working on physician enablement as well.

As I say that, you still expect us to hit our target margin by the end of the year.

With respect to North Carolina, yes, I guess, I will just say, again we are monitoring it everyday right now, I am going to say that we are continuing to push and it is a big component of our opportunity in 2020 from revenue and a membership perspective. But that being said, there is a lot of other growth opportunities that we are measuring to. We didn\u2019t have Kentucky in our guidance, but we also didn\u2019t not got pushed, but we also didn\u2019t have the Massachusetts care bid that we just won.

", ["John?\nJohn Rex\nSarah thanks for the question. As you know, we are committed to driving to a strategy around negotiating with the clients of a transparent model where more and more of our services are coming from administrative fees and value-based arrangements. Our clients decide how they want to pay for our services. So when we bid on a deal and for our client, we give them an opportunity either to pay through administrative fee or with spread or traditional. So it\u2019s the client choice. So as you look at it, we don\u2019t have a preference about where we want to go up in business model. We are in different on how a client wanted to choose it. In terms of the commercial market, the trend in the market hasn\u2019t changed in the last several years. So actually the client is not going to move one way or the other in terms of spread versus administrative fee. As you look at the Medicaid market, there has been a trend over the last three years where more and more of the state organizations and have been moving to administrative fees. So if you looked at our client base 3 years ago, majority would have been spread. If you look at it today, less than a quarter is in spread and actually we expect that to almost disappear as you look out next year or 2 years.

And at least for us, we are -- our Medicare Advantage product reduces the Part A, B benefit cost by 25% or so, and even more so when you connect UnitedHealthcare to an OptumCare enterprise where the higher performing ones reduce it by as much as 35%.

Again, I think, just echoing what Dave said, we're really pleased with what we heard in the executive order, some of the elements inside that or what we've been advocating for to make the program even stronger for the seniors in America today. Flexibility around product design for specific conditions, the use of incentives to drive better adherence and better health and certainly just promoting MA and driving better education and awareness for the benefits that it can provide, all were inside that executive order.

And obviously, the narrative that we constructed for today was really all about how we're bringing the strength and power of Optum and UnitedHealthcare to create exactly that shift. And I think we're seeing some decent progress overall, but there is more work to be done. Andrew, do you want to comment on\u2026?\nAndrew Witty\nYes. Thanks very much, Dave. And John, thanks for the -- a good question. I'm just going to pick out one detail from the question you asked and then kind of lift up a slightly broader perspective of I think perhaps how Optum can drive the improvement you're looking for. So, you're quite right, and John Prince mentioned today that drug price inflation is decelerating year-on-year. But, what you have to look at is the cost of new drugs being introduced. Drug price inflation is only comparing the price of an existing drug this year versus last year but it\u2019s not addressing the very high cost of new specialty drugs, gene therapies and those sorts of products coming into the market.\nSo, if you look at the overall average cost of pharmaceutical deployed, I think, the price -- I think, you'll will find the price mix is nowhere near reflected in the decelerating inflation curve. That really speaks to a continued need for focus on managing the appropriate utilization of those types of medicines. They are super exciting for patients, but we need to make sure that we modernize as a system our ability to procure effectively on behalf of our customers and patients. Just one example of why you can get confusing signals when you look at some of this data.\nIf I just step back from an Optum perspective, what we're excited about and tried to share in the prepared comments at the beginning of the call is we're now beginning to see the coming together of years of preparation and work in various models within the Optum organization. I gave three or four OptumCare examples where we have now seen material reductions in cost compared to previous date. Our goal now is, first of all, to spread that activity across the broader network of Optum, nationally; and secondly, to further deepen the contact, the cost reducing impact by bringing together the various assets that we have in several cities across the U.S. We have tens of different ambulatory assets. We're working to super hard now to bring those together, combine that with the data and analytics that the Company holds. We think that can be truly transformational. So, the challenge is now to bring together these proof points that we have and really deliver an industrial scale across the U.S. We think that's the way to really transform the quality of care for patients and give them reassurance about being able to manage its costs. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann\nThank you. We have time for one last question."]], ["Just John Muir, I don't really have a sense of the size of that business, not sure what you said or what you can share and is that business additive for you over the first year, maybe just any perspective you can share about the relationship in any potential interest from other health systems to exploring a partnership like that? ", ["Okay. I'll turn to Dan Schumacher.\nDan Schumacher\nGood morning, Whit. Thank you for the question. So, in terms of sizing, John Muir, over the contract, which is a 10-year term, is a $1.6 billion revenue opportunity. And obviously our backlog, it contributes a five-year duration to that as well. I'm pleased to share that we're off to a good start and we've transitioned our employees over the course of the third quarter and it's progressing nicely. More broadly, for us, it really marks an exciting transition for OptumInsight, transitioning from what has historically been a point solution technology provider to more of a diversified enterprise solutions organization. So, what does that mean, how do we fully integrate the combination of our data foundations, our analytic capacities, our technology assets, as well as really the knowhow of our 185,000 people, and we're doing that across both the clinical and administrative domains as we move forward. So, in the wake of the announcement, we have seen some increased entrants for sure, and we're advancing those discussions. And we look forward to it contributing to our growth profile in 2020 and well beyond.\nDavid Wichmann\nThank you, Whit. That's all the time we have today for questions. Thank you for those questions.

Josh, thanks for the question Eric Murphy with OptumInsight. Our partnership with John Muir Health really represents one of the most comprehensive in the healthcare industry, between a delivery system and a health care services company. The integrated scope of services includes acute and ambulatory revenue cycle management end-to-end information technology services, ambulatory care coordination, enterprise analytics, purchasing and consulting services.\nIt is very unique in the marketplace in that health system has never contemplated putting out that much of a scope of work on both the back office as well as what I'd call the middle office of a delivery system. So it is quite unique and first in the industry, and Optum is ideally suited to be able to address those expansive needs of John Muir Health.\nIn terms of the third part of your question, our market knowledge suggests that several hundred regional health systems have similar size and market opportunity as John Muir. We\u2019re already in discussions with several high performing independent community based systems and look forward to establishing continued partnerships, similar to John Muir Health, with health systems across the industry.\nAndrew, do you want to take the second part?\nAndrew Witty\nYes. Thanks, Eric. And thanks, Josh, for the question. I mean, clearly, we have a very strong view that the best way forward in terms of improving quality bringing down total cost of care is to increasingly new towards value in terms of the management of the care continuum. That is very much the focus of the OptumCare strategy and is resonant throughout all of our various platforms. But it's also very clear that we're seeing more and more systems begin to look to move in that direction.\nWhere as they look to Optum, they can see portfolios of information systems, skills, which have been developed within our own organization, which are going to be just as useful within those systems as they are within for example, our OptumCare organization. So for us, this is a very important opening up of a new front in terms of the opportunity to develop our interventions in the marketplace, and we believe move to a more sustainable high quality, lower cost healthcare environment."]], ["You raised, the quarter I guess by more than you beat consensus, consensus isn\u2019t always where I guess the company is thinking the numbers are going to be for the quarter.

First, we have begun to look at it more closely and thinking about whether how we are contributing to bringing a greater affordability more broadly across the segment of Medicare, Medicaid in commercial. And have started to evaluate that against NHE to determine again, whether we are a contributor to trend or whether we are actually reducing trend.\nAnd so that that's something that I think you'll hear more about from us. The other is as we sit here, we oftentimes talk in commercial trend context in these settings. All the while, we have a very robust and large government programs based business. And those obviously have trends inside them as well. So we're trying to think about a way to bring forward a view of that more broadly. So you can assess our aggregate performance across our business.\nWe -- so NHE will be important in that respect. It is a complicated metric in many respects, I can -- I think I can safely say that we are contributing positively to reducing the nation's healthcare burden. And that healthcare burden has been declining over the course of the more recent past. And we would aim very hard to continue to move that forward, recognizing that the way to get that done is to advanced quality first and foremost, which is really the improving outcomes. And then the evaluation of and making sure that we drive efficiency in the use of the nation's healthcare resources in achieving that quality, and then not missing the opportunity to improve the patient experience as well.\nSo this is a very high priority for this organization to contribute in a constructive way to reducing the overall healthcare burden in the U.S. And we believe you can see that in some of the remarks that, informing the health system through the application of the IHR, engaging people and managing their health conditions more proactively through the Raleigh platform and aligning the reward system in healthcare to drive that triple A value is essential to achieving that. And that's the essence of the commentary that I began this call with today.\nWe would add a fourth element to that and that was really around our physicians and providing them a work environment or environment where they can practice medicine, the way they've been trained and to allow them to the freedoms without burnout to be able to deliver solid, high quality outcomes and results for their patient base.

We're soft as you mentioned timing right now remains uncertain, but CMS clarified the bids should assume the current rules as they apply. And as you mentioned, CMS is providing some protections in form of a risk corridor, that plans it had lowered premiums with rebates, we'll be able to apply and we're certainly appreciative of that guidance.\nI will suggest that it won't fully mute an increase in member premiums, but will be helpful. We certainly intend to participate in the demonstration to the extent the new rule does impact our plans. I will say that I don't think the corridor protections are going to meaningful change bid strategies, or competitive behaviors.\nIt's important to remember, these are partial protections and they only apply if the rule passes, so plans need to be disciplined in their pricing regardless. I will just leave with the comment around this context. Important to remember, we're only talking about rebates and where they apply, as they've ever been retained by plans, whether that's point-of-sale or in premium and when.

I think what we are seeing is, some of the benefits of a very substantial amount of innovation around our offering design that John and his team have been developing, partly in anticipation of changes in the policy environment that obviously been touched on already in this call conversation, but also taking advantage of technology and other levers that have been brought alongside the traditional core PBM of OptumRx.\nI think it's that combination of all of those things, really, leaning into exploring value-based propositions and really being extremely dynamic in the way in which we start to bring to bear some of these different tools that has created a very competitive set of offerings. Let me ask John just to describe you how that's landing for us this year and projected for next year.\nJohn Prince\nJay, it's John Prince. In terms of our 2020 selling season it is still early, but we have a very healthy pipeline of opportunities. We've already had some really good wins for 2020. We've sold several large health plans. They stayed in a variety of large employers.\nTwo good examples that -- of large wins already was the Hubbard program announcement and of our partnership in early January. They selected us because of our partnership around total cost of care, clinical outcomes, consumer experience sort of resonating, what Andrew Witty just mentioned, around our innovation around the consumer and clinical outcomes.\nAnother example of a good win for 2020 is, with HealthTrust and their division for CoreTrust, they selected OptumRx as their exclusive pharmacy care services provider to improve the performance of healthcare. We'll be their key strategic channel partner for health systems in Fortune 2000 companies.\nIn the overall market, you asked around, our value story, I think, our value proposition is resonating their market. Others might be now using the same vocabulary as we have, but we've been working at this for five years. We continue to modernize our offering, continue to innovate around outcomes and also we continued to expand the services that we have to support unique communities and partnerships. And I think that's also a differentiation for us in the market. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann\nIt's a great question. What you're seeing there is a innovation and play, starting with synchronization, but really the development of a modern, much more modern pharmacy care services business that continues to stay out of the marketplace and is really responding to the needs of employers, health plans, and others out there and seeing the growth as a result."]], ["The number that was astounding to me at least was that we calculated the mid-teens organic growth at OptumHealth, which as you know would be 3x the organic growth of any kind of stand-alone services providers that's track publicly.

The thing I am concerned about is the return of the health insurance tax in 2020. That will increase the cost to health care by at least $20 billion for 142 million people.\nAnd if you do the math on that that increased premiums for a senior couple by $500 dollars and for families with small business coverage by about the same amount. And that outcome from our standpoint is entirely unacceptable.\nThe healthcare already costs too much in these unnecessary taxes layered on top of what is already in high-cost health system is just untenable.

That\u2019s still a very significant number for any company, I would say, and a burden for our customers.\nSo \u2013 but, you are correct in thinking that the non-insurance components of our enterprise continues to grow at a reasonable pace, and as that pacing increases and the mix continues to shift, as a percentage of our earnings mix in terms of the volatility that the HIF coming in and out in any particular starts to diminish as a percentage of the earnings mix. But again, remiss to say that it\u2019s still a very significant burden for Americans.\nDavid Wichmann\nAnd on that score, the health insurance tax is expected to come back in 2020 and I think I\u2019ll recognize this, but it will increase the cost of healthcare by $20 billion for 142 million Americans. That causes the average senior couple to see their premiums raised by $500 per year and for families with small business coverage by about the same amount, around $480 or so per year.\nSo, our view is that outcome is unacceptable and - because healthcare already cost too much, so we are going to continue to advocate for our appeal, our deferral of this unnecessary tax. We can\u2019t comment or speculate on the outcome, but we would take this opportunity to also applaud the bipartisan actions that have occurred across Congress both the Senate and the House in this past year or so, and hopefully we will get this taken off the backs of consumers there pretty soon.

And I was evaluating that over the course of the last, at least my timeframe here which has been nearing about 21 years or so, just by way of background we have grown our revenue base in this business from $12 billion at that time to $226 billion which we just reported today.\nWhat I find is, particularly in healthcare, as well economic cycles is that, that sentiment tends to drive our private sector expansion and we\u2019ve seen that through Medicare advantage. We see that with the introduction of Part D, managed Medicaid, Duals, Medicaid expansion changes the ACA broadly and then also what we discussed this morning with respect to the VA and how they have sought public private partnership to respond the needs of veterans.\nOne thing that\u2019s true through these political shifts and economic shifts is that healthcare products are always in demand. So whether it\u2019s an economic expansion or a recession or whether there is a liberal or conservative administration, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s positioning tends to be unique and very well regarded.\nWe manage a portfolio of diverse healthcare businesses and they serve large and diverse end-markets and we tend to grow regardless of economic cycle or administration. We have unique portfolio of competencies and data technology as well as clinical insights and actually our ability to manage clinical interactions just continues to advance across this business which is reinforcing that capability in our business.\nAnd our line services have never been positioned to produce greater value for society, for clients, consumers. You can hear us talking a lot more around cite of return in the triple aim and then also becoming more of consumer oriented company which is really what MPS signifies. So, just maybe to wrap up, this is a very scaled improving model. It has a deep management team with strong continuity. It\u2019s largely 95% domestic.\nSo we really don\u2019t have tariff, Brexit or other global concerns and it is a long runway for growth. It has five well-defined high performing growth pillars that are going to meet in the $11 trillion global market in 2025.

Of course, we have our own points of view about what we expected the growth rate to be in the Medicare Advantage market, and of course CMS\u2019 number was quite a bit higher than that.

As we\u2019ve said in previous quarters, we look at the long-term industry growth rate for MA more in that 7% to 8% range. As I said last quarter, Justin, our planning is certainly to outpace that rate as we have now for four or five years. As Dave said, a lot of optimism but a lot of ranges around what the growth rate might be for 2019.

We are very excited about those. There\u2019s a lot of adaptability for those across multiple aspects of our business. Andrew Witty, would you like to comment?\nAndrew Witty\nThanks, Dave. So again, thanks for the question. Yes, during the quarter we acquired both Avella and Genoa, both of which are going to be potentially very important additions to our specialty pharmacy portfolio. They made very small contribution in the quarter itself, but going forward we see them offering distinctive contributions in the behavioral space as well as in the specialty, particularly the oncology space. To your more general question around the role and the importance of PBMs, I think it\u2019s important to reflect on really the fundamental role the PBM offers which is to aggregate volume and to ensure a pricing discipline within the pharmaceutical sector without which there really wouldn\u2019t be any kind of discipline around drug price increasing phenomenon. As you know, drug companies are free to increase prices at will. The PBM acts as a mechanism to discipline that process. Historically, that\u2019s been through the rebating mechanism. As we look forward, we\u2019re ready for whatever evolution of that marketplace might take place. The diversification of the OptumRx portfolio into a really diversified portfolio of pharmacy services is really displayed in its continued growth rate, development of the Briova infusion business as one example. We\u2019ve seen a significant set of positive evolution there. To the degree to which there is change in the PBM environment, I\u2019d come back to my first point. It\u2019s critical that any environment ensures that there is a disciplining mechanism for price increases in the U.S., and whether that\u2019s through rebate or any other mechanism, we\u2019re ready to engage with whatever changes might come along.\nDavid Wichmann\nSo, Justin, I may just add. You probably noticed or the markets have noticed a pivot for us from a PBM to a pharmacy care services-based business, and I know we\u2019ve been talking about that for some time, but more increasingly over the course of the last couple of years or so, with Andrew here \u2013 Andrew Witty, he\u2019s taken an actually modernized and advanced set approach even more so for us really enhancing our thinking in this area, and I think what you can expect from us is that we\u2019ll be deeply thoughtful about how we engage and participate broadly but also have confidence that we\u2019ll navigate through this change similar to the way we have across other changes in healthcare in the past.

And to Dave\u2019s point when we do these things we\u2019re seeing the savings in the order of magnitude of 30% compared to traditional Medicare in a growing number of our mature markets. As was referenced earlier, we\u2019re present in 30 markets across OptumCare. There are varying levels of depth in those markets but all of them are on the pathway towards value, value-based contracting, value-based clinical programs, culture, how we orient our physicians. We\u2019re deepening our presence in those communities that we serve again at different points along the continuum but we\u2019re all deepening and growing and we\u2019re optimistic we\u2019re in the early stages as Andrew Witty shared of the potential of OptumCare.

Dan?\nDan Schumacher\nGood morning, Zach. So we did, as Dave mentioned, we announced our change earlier this year and that actually goes into effect beginning 1/1/2019 for all new and renewing groups forward in our fully insured group portfolio. So at this point it\u2019s coming up on 1/1/'19 where we\u2019ll see that roll into place. And the reaction from our customer base and the broker community has been strong. I think it adds a level of transparency to consumers and helps to return the economic incentive associated with the rebates to them at the point of sale and that\u2019s particularly important when people are in high deductible offerings where they\u2019re sharing the first dollar burden of healthcare more broadly. As it relates to our self-funded client base, we continue to see more interest in that offering and obviously they\u2019re trying to think about how it all balances out in the context of how they set their contribution strategy, their benefit strategy that underpins that.

It\u2019s John Prince. In terms of the broader market we\u2019ve seen good uptake. We\u2019ve been doing this in a market for several years in terms of our large sophisticated clients. We\u2019ve seen a real fee change this past year with first with UnitedHealthcare doing their fully insured book. We have additional million lives that are picking up in the self-insured market. We also have additional health plan clients that are going to adopt it later in 2019, 2020. In terms of a consumer experience, we\u2019re seeing a value of about $150 of value delivered back to an individual consumer when they have \u2013 when it\u2019s all rebate.

It also assess to what extent that they\u2019ve in and how they\u2019ve been served by the health system broadly and whether or not there\u2019s been any gaps in care that have been left behind. Our visions are also to take that to care providers to provide them with similar information but in a format that looks a little bit more like their EHR. And again, would include next best action as well. And so that would be provided to the physician and the workflow of the physician\u2019s office. And you might imagine what that could ultimately lead to in terms of continuing to develop a transaction flow between the physician and us and the consumer and us as us of being the custodian to try to drive better health outcomes for people but also ensure that the highest level of quality is adhered to quality defined by evidence-based practices and then also containing costs and eventually to incent the health system around responding to those deeply personal circumstances and situations.

You see that measured pretty consistently across the board of our organization. My only regret sometimes is whether or not we can do that faster and to have an even greater impact and that is what our deep intention is. I do think that our momentum around our competitiveness continues to accelerate and as a result I think you continue to see the broad-based results that are indicated in this release and also in the ambitions that we have for 2019 and beyond.

", ["Okay. We will take both those questions. Tim you want to take the first one?\nTim Wicks\nSure. Happy to do that. Dave thank you very much for the question. So, on OptumInsight, as we think about the quarter and we think about the margin growth it really is two items. One, you referenced pricing and mix and there is a significant amount of mix opportunity that is occurring in terms of growth of business around the risk and quality businesses, as well as payment integrity, and then the second area that is also important and continues to be important, you heard us talk a significant amount in 2017 about the discipline that we drove financial discipline and overall cost management, and that\u2019s really coming through the business. Frankly, all across Optum, but specifically an OptumInsight in the quarter as well.\nDavid Wichmann\nGreat. And then if I can I will just make a few remarks on Rally as well. Thank you for the question. Rally as you can tell in the script is something that we're very proud of having developed over the course of last four years. Obviously, there was a lot of work that went into in advance of our alignment with them, but they\u2019ve done a very nice job of taking a single product company and making it multidimensional along the lines that Andrew has described. So, we are seeing probably the very fast uptake and in fact accelerating uptake of that business as we expand our offerings to respond to greater levels of consumer need.\nSo as an example, when we gave Rally the responsibility for our premium designation program, which is effectively the way in which consumers search for and find a physician and/or other care services we gave that responsibility we also started to appeal to a broader group of consumers, which dramatically increase the registration rate across that platform now sitting at I believe somewhere around 18 million people are registered with Rally today.\nSo, we believe that the expansion of the value that is offered on the Rally chassis is the single best way to get there and that really requires that we continue to provide a significant value to consumers both in terms of cost containment, but also in terms of the improved health that they each received. So, we\u2019re continuing to expand and diversify that offering keeping it simple for people and we look forward to the developments that we will see with the individual health record and how that drives next best action and to the consumers that we serve and expect to see increased utilization as a result as well."]], ["Andrew welcome aboard in your first quarter in the hot seat, and I kind of want to understand what you expect to be different about growing Optum going forward under you relative to how it\u2019s grown in the past?

I\u2019ll ask Tim in a second to address your second part of the question, but in terms of the first, obviously very early days for me here at Optum, I them terrific foundations have been laid over the last seven or eight years in terms of the asset base of this company has is rarely, I think unparallel in terms of the portfolio of assets that we have. As we look forward, I think the opportunity is going to be very much centered around how we start to drive the gearing between all of these assets to really bring to life the full potential of this portfolio.\nAnd I think what we see, a very high level is significant at direct local interface as care provider and touch points with patients and consumers. So, a business with a real face backed up with an extraordinary evolving digital capability, which then allows us to drive high frequency contact really all underpinned by tremendous commitment to care and delivering quality of care, commitment to bringing down total cost of care and ensuring all of that is done in an extraordinary high-quality way.\nSo, I think all of those tenants of the business, which have got us thus far are going to be absolutely the characteristics going forward. What I\u2019m focusing on now of course is really making sure I understand all of the various parts of this business, working with the team to figure out the next steps, but it is going to, I think be characterized very much in the way I just described. Maybe, I could pass to Tim to answer the more specific question on the quarter.\nTim Wicks\nSure. Peter, thank you for the question. First, what I would say is, as we look at the growth rate of revenue at Optum both year-over-year and sequentially it is in-line with our plans in both of those ways of looking at it. The revenues of 24.7 billion were up 9% or up 2.1 billion, compared to a year ago with both OptumHealth and OptumInsight posting double-digit growth rates and with OptumRx posting a 7% growth rate year-over-year.\nIn each of those businesses, organic growth was very strong, both in OptumHealth, in terms of care delivery with market expansion, as well as OptumServe volume growth and then behavioral health and then in OptumInsight, strong growth with the addition of the advisory board, but also pretty significant volume growth in terms of our risk and quality business and then also volume growth and payment integrity.\nAlso, when I mentioned OptumRx earlier in the overall revenue growth there, I think it is important to understand that that\u2019s driven by new sales growth in terms of new clients that have come on, as well as very strong expansion in terms of specialty as well. So, really solid growth across the businesses and in-line with our expectations."]], ["Can you give us a sense of what you're seeing out there, has that sort of decades long shift ASO stalled or slowed or are you seeing greater demand for group risk products now and if so, why do you think that is? ", ["Dan?\nDan Schumacher\nSure, thanks Steve. This is Dan Schumacher. You had a few things tucked in there, but first just on the quarter and the decline with regard to self-funded enrolment. In reality, there is, it is just sort of the normal seasonal pattern, particularly in our international accounts and quarter-based attrition. So, if you look at that outcome it compares into the average of the last 5 or 10 years it is very much in keeping with that.\nSo, really just the normal seasonal pattern we see on the ASO front. I think you had asked about is there an acceleration or a change in the trend in the migration from fully integrated to self-funded. That continues to be a recurring theme I would say, it's sort of add a comparable pace to what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years.\nSo, I wouldn't spike out any acceleration or deceleration in that. We don't believe on the fully insured side to see greater take-up rights, what we\u2019re doing there is we are actually taking market share, and I think that large contributor to that is really the work that we\u2019ve done as I had mentioned before around expanding our product portfolio around that value of continuum and then making sure importantly we pair it with really high performing care delivery partners both OptumCare, as well as externally, and then improving as we have talked about the consumer experience and making it simple and personal for them.\nYou had asked I think also about Nexus ACO. We continue to build that product and are excited for the prospects and just as a reminder for those on the phone that Nexus ACO offering is really a national accountable care offering. So, we string together our best solutions locally onto a national solution. Today we've got about 75,000 enrollees on that. We\u2019ll double that as we turn into the year and we look to double that again by the time we get to the end of 2019. Thanks Steve.\nDavid Wichmann\nSo, really Steve what you\u2019ve hit on is this category of growth for us, pillar of growth around consumer centric benefits, and Nexus ACO would be one example, but if you look to the distinguished group insured growth over the course of the last three years or so, and why we are bullish on growth going forward it\u2019s really because of these new designs that were progressively putting in the marketplace and may be tied to the question to before that.

I don't want to leave you with that point-of-view, but by most measures with the company of that capacity that this one has, I just believe we should be able to move faster with greater speed and agility to respond to emerging market demand for these kinds of services.\nWe are well up front with all of them, but my view is we need to get these into the hands of the consumers faster and make a bigger difference on how the effectiveness of health systems and the health of people.

First on MLR, just to say that, that was right in-line with our expectations and as we noted earlier, there is - we're not changing our outlook for the full-year at all and the year-over-year change is an element that we described, the insurers' tax impact is favorable and then business mix and the less favorable development go on the other direction. As far as acuity, we would - overall acuity in aggregate is in-line with our expectations out there as well.\nWhat you'll see over time though as we work hard to keep moving lower acuity in each category to its appropriate place of service that what remains in each category will naturally have a little bit upward pressure on acuity inside those categories. No change in our view on unit cost versus utilization, still it's 4% primary driver being the unit cost and 2% of utilization. And then I think the last piece was Banmedica, I think Dave touched a little bit on that earlier from given the size of Banmedica against our total medical expense base, it's really not a material factor at this point.\nDavid Wichmann\nSo, you should conclude from this that the trends are very much in-line with our expectations for the year.

It doesn't really show up quarter-to-quarter, it shows up going from Q4 to Q1 and less dramatic when you get into Q2. Our development as indicated in the script, it really relates to Q1 this year and it's not all that different from the development that we experienced in Q2 2017, related to the first quarter of 2017 as well.

Next question please."]], ["I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the 2019 selling season, I guess, both on the managed care side and the PBM side; I guess, on the managed care side addressing kind of the question about how you're seeing the competitors think about tax reform impacting that through. ", ["Okay, I think we'll start with Dan on the managed care side, and then we'll flip to John Prince on PBM.\nDan Schumacher\nKevin, with regards to the national account selling season, I would tell you that it's -- at this point, it's very early in the decision cycle. The pipeline itself is a little bit larger, but also the amount that we're defending. For the portion that's resolved at this point, I would say that the early theme is one around incumbency, but at the enterprise we think we have a lot to offer employers looking for progressive solutions to benefits for their employees. And likewise, we expect to again be successful in 2019 on converting retirees into group Medicare Advantage offerings. So we'll look to give you updates on the selling season as we progress through the year. I think you also tucked in a question around tax and pricing inside that I think probably aimed more towards the fully insured marketplace. And I would say at this point we haven't seen any measurable change in pricing related to the tax itself. The reality is the impact is somewhere around 0.5 points, give or take a little bit. Plus, companies have expressed interest in investing some of that money as well, so it gets diluted further. So at this point, we haven't seen anything specific related to the tax pricing.\nDavid Wichmann\nAnd on the PBM?\nJohn Prince\nYes. Kevin, it's John Prince. I'd say, in terms of the PBM, the market is still invested in the 2019 selling season for large groups. The activity is very strong, but the season is still developing, especially if you look at 1/1/19 and beyond. We've had some good success initially in the market. We've sold some large-, also some medium-size health plan business as well as some large employers, but the vast majority of the decisions in the mid to large are still pending. So you asked a question about pricing, pricing is very competitive, but I'd say it's stable. And I'd say also, in terms of the value story and how we're positioned ourselves relative to our competitor, I'd say our value story is resonating in the market. We've been able to really differentiate ourselves in 3 key points. One, people like our message around [indiscernible] price for drugs. Two is the focus on total cost of care and how we bring medical and pharmacy together to reduce the total costs for our clients. And third is our focus on the consumer. And I think you heard today around PreCheck MyScript, our focus on point-of-sale rebates. Other innovations we're doing in the market around best price are really differentiating ourselves in the market. And so our story to the market is really simple, we're focused on our clients. We're focused on our consumers. We have an 8-quarter road map that we're executing against those 3 key components, and it's resonating very well. So we're very pleased of how the season started, and a lot more to share as the season progresses."]], ["The earnings beat was a little bit more than double the guidance raise, so can you walk us through bits and points of conservatism or maybe some offsets and headwinds that would bridge us to the beat versus the guidance raise? ", ["Yes. I can tell you, well, the earnings beat and the forward guidance are a little disconnected because of some of the headwinds we expect or have already experienced in 2017 and expect for -- or 2018, excuse me, and expect for the balance of the year as well. So John will discuss those as well as the tax item.\nJohn Rex\nYes. John Rex here. Thanks for the question. So I would just also note that the earnings beat is against a consensus view and -- but is more in line with our expectations in terms of where we would -- where we seek to perform. Let me just talk about a few of the other components here, though, as you talk about the tax rate. So also, tax rate really in line with our view. So our view is approximately 24% for the year. That's still the case, and the 1Q effective tax rate was in line with our own expectations. So the main factor that is driving the lower tax rate in the first half of the year is driven by the share-based accounting rule changes that were implemented in -- a couple years ago, the beginning of '16, I believe. So -- and the pattern of our share-based awards creates a higher level of vestings and exercises in the first half, and that's been consistent over time. That 2016 change then drove more volatility in the earnings as a result. And the exercise of share-based awards supports that impact and dependent upon share price and shareholder activity, so a little more difficult to project, but I'd say kind of where we came in, in the 1Q was in line with our expectations. So history continues to be a guide. We expect our lowest effective tax rate in the first half, with 1Q typically somewhat lower than 2Q but depends on activity there. And then there is typically much less exercise activity in the second half of the year, which results in the -- in our highest rates being in that period.\nDavid Wichmann\nGreat. Thank you, Sarah."]], ["I wondered if you could tell us the percent of commercial enrollment, aging, at the Medicare annually; or maybe an average age of the commercial book; and then an average age with Medicare Advantage.

And then also, if you have -- Brian, if you have additional comments on the growth rate, that would be fine, on the [indiscernible].\nBrian Thompson\nSure. Thanks for the question, Steve. Brian Thompson here. Maybe I'll start with a view to our book. We really -- well, we have shown tremendous growth, as you know, in Medicare Advantage over the course of the last four years. We've still been very stable in terms of our demographics and our underlying mix, so we really haven't seen a big shift there, really strong growth. And retention obviously playing a real big role in that growth has really enabled that stability of our book. As we look forward, we have signaled we expect a long-term growth rate in Medicare Advantage around 8%. I think that'll ebb and flow mildly. I would look to 2019 and still expect it probably within that range. As you know, over the course of the past four years, we've meaningfully outperformed that and gained share against that.\nYou made mention around the growth rate being pretty strong inside these rates. I don't like to break down the componentry of the rating buildup. I think you need to look at them all in the broad context, again, of being stronger than it has been historically; several things playing into that strong growth rate, though, for 2019, some of which was some of the statements related to prior years. And as you know, we've suggested an underfunding in prior years, and I think that's supported with the growth rate strength. And some CMS incentive payment changes for their MACRA program et cetera that relate specifically to fee-for-service Medicare. So nothing really in that growth rate that we're seeing that would really -- anything to be gleaned with respect to forward cost trend for us. So again, really optimistic about the outlook very stable in terms of our own book and margin profiles, again aided in large part by our strong, really record-setting retention that we've seen year-over-year.\nDavid Wichmann\nSo we'd expect continued growth in the Medicare Advantage product lines, both supported by the market broadly as well as our individual capacities to create distinctive offerings and serve seniors."]], ["Jumping up from that on Medicare Advantage, can you talk a little bit about the increasing presence we're seeing from competitors such as Aetna and Anthem growing their Medicare Advantage businesses, even the not-for-profit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans? ", ["Brian?\nBrian Thompson\nThanks for the question, Peter. From our vantage point, this marketplace has always been very competitive. For me, it's really less about newfound competitive dynamics; and really more about the optimism we have, the optimism of ushering more seniors into the value Medicare Advantage offers really industry wide. As I said, the Medicare Advantage market continues to be severely underpenetrated. It's 33% today. We see a path, as we mentioned previously, to over 50% over the next 5 to 10 years. And we believe this set of policies and the funding that we see in 2019 are enablers in that regard. So we expect really good, broad-based benefit stability; and are very optimistic about both the industry and our position in it; and think it's great for seniors and the program popularity at large.\nDavid Wichmann\nThank you for the question, Peter."]], ["I wanted to talk a little bit about the comments that you were making about this movement towards value-based care and that 50% of the population will be in there in a few years; and then kind of juxtapose that with all of the work you guys are doing on sort of retail attachment points, right, and specifically around MedExpress and some of the physician groups that you're working with. ", ["Thanks for the question, Josh. I'll have Andrew Hayek talk about the OptumCare strategy more broadly, but I think you could see at least 2 of the 5 growth categories that we've laid out for some time now are clearly aimed at this as well as a few other macro trends that we expect to develop over the course of the next decade or so. With UnitedHealthcare, it's been working towards advancing more consumer-centric benefits. And you've seen that as one of the core fuels, if you will, for the growth that they've experienced over the course of the past couple few years. In particular as we look forward, we see consumer-centric benefit profile that continues to refine. These are benefits that really respond to the unique needs of individual consumers, on the one hand. And at -- on the other hand, they are accessing well-informed and technology-enabled, performance-based networks that provide very high-quality, lower-cost and -- care that more deeply satisfies the consumer's individual needs. And so that's the evolution that we see on that front. Obviously, we've also invested in OptumCare, and we've taken some pretty bold steps to build out that strategy broadly across several markets so far. We have a ways to go yet and we're in our early stages of development overall, but clearly we see an opportunity to advance those 3 objectives as well, lower costs, higher quality and greater levels of patient satisfaction, while providing a strong environment for doctors to practice in that business. Andrew, more comments on OptumCare and where we're headed?\nAndrew Hayek\nThanks, Dave. And Josh, appreciate the question. I think there's a tight interplay between the consumer-centric evolution of the health care system and our OptumCare platform. So a couple comments. As you know, we're positioned to be the leading high-value medical group and ambulatory care organization in the country with an ambition to serve 75 markets. And we're enabling this transition to value-oriented and more consumer-centric care and through our models to improve the quality, experience and total cost of health care through deploying advanced technology and data that leverage the breadth and depth of capabilities within Optum to promote delivery of evidence-based medicine and improve the consumer experience. And the results are really powerful in terms of stars; HEDIS measures; Net Promoter Scores, to your point, around a more consumer-centric world. And OptumCare NPS scores approach 80. In our MedExpress and SCA sites, they're averaging a similar range, so very, very strong consumer experience.\nAnd then of course, it plays right into reducing the total cost of care, as was shared in the earnings script. In terms of MedExpress, there's a tight interplay that the MedExpress neighborhood care centers are a very consumer-centric front door to the health care ecosystem, and that's evidenced by their high NPS. And then through that front door, we're able to help patients access the right providers, including our OptumCare value-oriented medical groups; similarly with SCA surgery centers, very consumer-centric experience that ties in -- really in a very complementary manner to value-based care and driving quality experience and total cost. So we think these components really fit together nicely the ambitions of where UHG and other leading payers in the country want to go, and we feel really good about the impact in the communities we serve.\nDavid Wichmann\nAnd Josh, the these same designs are being deployed in South America, and the early returns on those are very positive as well. We're starting with Brazil, some of which take on care features where we're utilizing our delivery system very tightly. And others are more broadly accessing network-based care. And we can see the same type of designs working in the other 3 South American countries we just advanced as well, so broadly speaking, we think these are -- this is a trend that we'll see evolve globally as well as right here in the United States. Thank you."]], ["I guess the question is more broader, though, in terms of whether you're seeing more of this today than maybe in the past, if you've come up against sort of more stalemates with providers around contract disputes and sort of more out-of-network claims coming through.

Ralph, it's we've talked a lot about this morning actually how we're trying to drive value with our partnerships and delivery system on behalf of the members that we serve. And obviously it's not going to get into specific conversations, but I'll tell you that we're making a lot of progress there. And it's coming through, as we talked about in both experience, the outcomes and also affordability. And it's broad based, but it's also relative to the conversations we've had this morning on OptumCare and the value we're seeing there as well. But I might just ask Dan Schumacher to talk a little about how we're advancing the conversations and our just holistic value relationships with the delivery system.\nDan Schumacher\nSure. Thanks, Steve. Ralph, to your specific question on out of network, we've actually been able to drive that down as a percentage of total spend over the last several years, so making nice progress there. And the reality is all of that's part of our efforts that we've been undertaking for several years to drive towards a value-based health care system. And there's two principal parts to that, first, looking to increase the amount of spend under value-based contracts; and then secondly and importantly, migrating that spend along the risk continuum, so towards managing the health of an overall population. On the amount, right now we've got nearly $65 billion or about half of our medical surgical spend in value-based constructs. That's a year earlier that we had expected to arrive at that destination, and so we've now set our sights towards $75 billion by 2020. And then we've also been very successful in migrating our incentives towards managing the health of a population. So we've moved that. five years ago, about 38% of that value-based spend was in those more progressive relationships. So we've migrated that up to about half as of today, and we'll continue to push forward on that.\nAnd as Steve mentioned, we've driven some very nice results across all three lines of business. We see things like lower in-patients' admission rates, lower readmission rates, lower ER use, higher primary care use, more preventative screening, better-quality outcomes on the most commonly tracked metrics. So some very strong results. These practices start with a better baseline, and then they trend at a better rate. In terms of sizing that, somewhere in the 1% to 3% range on a trend basis year in and year out, better than the folks that are outside of these relationships. So we will continue to seek to partner with people that share our vision around driving a truly value-based health care system.\nDavid Wichmann\nThank you, Ralph."]], ["I think it's pretty clear that you know the grossed up of the Medicaid - Medicaid states would require to give you back, needs to be smaller because the taxes go down, but beyond that can you help us understand how much that is of the half or more that\u2019s 400 to 500, how much is commercial and how much is Medicare that you might have passed through which I assume is zero on Medicare.

We come into Q4 with a very strong pipeline of active pursuits. So, we are very bullish on our ability to be able to achieve our objective as you stated a $15 billion to $16 billion of total backlog for 2017. We anticipate the contributions of that backlog in Q4 being concentrated around our inventory and acute revenue cycle management, where our pipeline is up 60% year-on-year. So, we anticipate a strong finish to Q4 into 2017.\nLarryRenfro\nSo, Dave, it\u2019s Larry, I want to take this back to Tim, because I don\u2019t believe he answered the margin question.\nTim Wicks\nGreat. Dave, first just to note, you had mentioned the margin at 20.7% for Q3. I think it\u2019s important to note, it\u2019s up 40 basis points from Q3 of 2016, so year-over-year a 40 basis point margin expansion than the same amount September year-to-date. Sequential margin expansion over just the last quarter has been 200 basis points, but as you think about that margin expansion just consistent with prior years, we anticipate being continued sequential margin expansion in Q4 and that\u2019s really driven by seasonality in the business whether it\u2019s perpetual sales or additional performance and incentive fee payments that we expect to see at the end of the year as well as Optum360 content sales and other technology and data and software sales. So, we expect this seasonality and we see it each year as we roll through the year and would expect the kind of Q4 seasonality that we have had previously, but not a real expectation to change our overall outlook to anything higher than what it is right now."]], ["So, forgive me, but I am going to make an observation here on, it is both comforting and remarkable in a positive way to note the consistency not only of the very strong results across the enterprise, but also the presentation and commentary and guidance and a brilliant debut, David and I don\u2019t say that for any reason other than must not be easy to come in front of all of us asking out the questions on your first earnings call and this is certainly a good way to start, but that consistency is important and the way I look at the company both in terms of the growth and in terms of the de-leveraging in the capital deployment which is where my question is going here.

As you might suspect this transition was architected by Steve Hemsley in our board and they have done a fantastic job and I guess that should be no surprise to anyone. And thank you for your acknowledgment of the performance of the business. It does continue to advance quite nicely. All that said, we are not yet performing at our full potential and there is a lot of opportunity for this organization to continue to improve to better serve people to grow organically as well as deploy capital in ways that it has in the past with maybe a slight tilt in direction overall. As you know, we haven\u2019t invested in a significant health plan in nearly 8 years. We do, do some small plug-in acquisitions here and there and largely for the purpose to enter into a new market and/or to gain some kind of competency that allows us to better serve people more nationally. So, the vast majority of what you have seen from us in terms of focus on the UnitedHealthcare front has been to drive an organic growth agenda and then to push more globally. And when I talk about globally I mean selectively globally, we entered into Brazil, we felt that, that was a good market. It is turning out to \u2013 as it continues to evolve to in fact be a good market and we look forward to the day when the political climate and regulatory and economic climates of Brazil shape up. We think that, that will be a nice growth category for the middle class and as a result will lead to nice growth in our business. You probably saw that we extended that into some initial activities in Chile, Colombia and Peru through the pre-announced acquisition that\u2019s underway with the Medica. That is \u2013 the combination of those two give us the type of South American presence that we believe we can leverage to serve the people of South America and they in a broader way recognizing fully that not all markets are investible. So, global will be part of it, but I would say measured global investments. The more significant investments that we will make going forward particularly on the growth front will be through Optum as we have in the past. As John articulated in the prepared remarks, we have formed the pharmacy care services business, which frankly allowed us to have a foundation from which to reinvent that business if you will meaning bringing greater technological capacities, bringing our synchronization story and capacities there as well as also addressing some of the transparency issues that exists in that market overall. We believe we can add considerable innovative value to evolving that.\nSecond of that would be are really where a lot of our investments are today is really in the healthcare delivery space, particularly in the ambulatory context across certain major markets in the United States. You have seen us move out on those obviously their smaller acquisitions, they may not show up as much, but the Optumcare business is one which we have grown nicely through local care practices establishing a foundation in urgent care, continuing to leverage our nurse at home capacities that came from the XLHealth acquisition dating back to 2011 I believe and \u201812 excuse me and then also the recent addition of our surgical capacities. So, Andrew Hayek and his team are continuing to build that business on an organic de novo as well as through the deployment of capital. And then I think, you will see us also move heavily in this area around technology and taking advantage of the vast assets that this company has in information and data leveraging that more distinctly like you have seen us with Rally, which was a pre-revenue company 3 years ago. Now, it\u2019s a distinctive consumer digital health capacity in the industry. We will continue to do the same on the healthcare delivery front as well as find ways to create greater value out of the data assets to better serve healthcare communities broadly. So, I\u2019d say those are the directions that we are headed with, so biased towards investing in Optum, but I would like to just underscore that our capital deployment philosophies will be consistent with what you have seen in the past. It\u2019s important for us to drive strong returns and liquidity for our shareholders. We will continue to see our dividend move to a market rate and we will be balanced about how we manage our debt positions as well."]], ["So, you have now returned to stellar ROE performance 22% plus, you\u2019ve got your debt to total capital under 30% at 38% presumably with the kind of growth you are talking about this year and next year there is more room and you have from what I see a multitude of opportunities, David is the keeper of the keys has been involved in so many of the acquisitions that the company has made and you are now sitting on top of the organization what\u2019s the next strategic direction in terms of capital deployment.

", ["Brian?\nBrian Thompson\nHi, Ralph. Yes, this is Brian Thompson. I won\u2019t get into the specifics. What I can share with you is obviously as we approach 2018, the return of the tax is the biggest headwind. The good news for us is our own internal advancements are really meaningfully helping us reduce that tax impact to those that we serve first and foremost is our quality advance, secondarily is the productivity and scale that we get from that growth. And then to your point, perhaps the biggest tailwind for us is that strong clinical engagement that we did in year one that we see come to fruition in year two. So, it\u2019s certainly the biggest momentum driver for us as we prepare for the return of the tax in 2018."]], ["I think that we really haven\u2019t delved in as much detail as some of the other things as OptumHealth and recognizing that as a tailwind to your 10% to 15% top line target as well as your 8% to 10% margin target. ", ["Maybe I will ask Tim to comment on the margin and then maybe Andrew can provide some comments about where we are headed with the business.\nTim Wicks\nSure, great. Thanks, Christine. So, as we think about the year today, reported margin grew 50 basis points year-over-year and 160 basis points sequentially driven by FDA. In addition, there was margin expansion from our care delivery businesses, HouseCalls and financial services as well and overall OptumHealth earnings grew 27% while we make strategic investments in the platform much as you represented. I think as you look at those investments, really important to think about that we make those investments in businesses that we have an intent to grow and those investments are designed to further improve that ability to grow and that\u2019s really evidenced even in this most recent reporting period around our revenue growth at OptumHealth of 21% year-over-year for the third quarter. I turn it over to Andrew to talk specifically about the areas of investment and market areas, where we are making those investments across platforms.\nAndrew Hayek\nThanks, Tim and thanks for the question, Christine. So, we are pleased to be at the higher end of our range of 8% to 10% margin in the third quarter. And as Tim mentioned, we continue to balance current profitability with making investments in future growth and some examples of those are investing to help transition physician groups from fee-for-service to value-based contracts, which does require an investment period. Second is investing to ramp up new contracts and as Larry mentioned in his prepared remarks, in our military and veterans segment as an example for contracts commencing in 2018. And thirdly is opening new MedExpress locations. And as you would imagine that requires an investment as each location ramps up to profitability. So given this, we expect our margin to continue to fluctuate over time and be in that range of 8% to 10%. We will continue to balance current profitability with investing and we were pleased with the 27% growth year-over-year in the quarter. There is strong performance across most of our businesses, local care delivery, HouseCalls, behavioral, financial services, consumer engagement. And so we were bullish on the business and we will continue to balance investing with current profitability.\nDavid Wichmann\nGreat. And Larry?\nLarry Renfro\nSo, Christine, it\u2019s Larry Renfro. I just want to make a couple of comments that one is kind of a commercial here on the military side, we have a new senior executive leader here by the name of General Patty Horoho. She has joined us about 5 months ago and she is leading the effort in the OptumHealth side of the military programs and I might ask \u2013 just ask her in a second to comment on a couple of the programs that are coming through on the military side. The other piece that I would add into this is that we have Optum360 that is part of our OptumInsight organization that utilizes OptumHealth as well in a lot its programs, especially when we do, do programs with major organizations that we have worked with on the West Coast and the East Coast. So that\u2019s tying in as well when you get to the physician groups and surgery centers and so forth. So, to keep it short, so Patty, would you mind just talking a little bit about what you are working on and give everybody a little [indiscernible].\nPatty Horoho\nThank you, Larry and good morning. I have the honor to join Optum about 6 months ago after 33 years of experience culminating as the 43rd U.S. Army Surgeon General. And what we have been able to do is really leverage and find ways to transform our healthcare system from one that treats diseases to one that promotes good health. And so two of our newest 5-year contracts kept in the September of this year, we began performing the medical disability event for military veterans on behalf of the Veterans Benefit Administration. And through this contract, we provide exams in 44 states in the District of Columbia. The second 5-year contract is the TRICARE Global Nurse Advice Line, where we will operate the Military Health System\u2019s Global Nurse Advice Line starting in 2018 and this is our frontline nurse advice care coordination line offered 24 hours a day utilizing telehealth capability to military service members, retirees and their families worldwide. And what I would just say is that this is just the beginning of our ability to serve our military, their families and our veterans and we are just getting started. Thank you.\nDavid Wichmann\nGreat. So, I think you could take from that that our bench is deep and continues to get deeper. Welcome, General Horoho and thank you Christine for your comments.\nDavid Wichmann\nSo, I will wrap briefly with this. UnitedHealth Group, Optum and UnitedHealthcare are intently focused on fulfilling the healthcare needs of the people and customers we serve. As we had distinct tangible value to healthcare, we continue to grow at a sustainable market leading pace. We expect to continue this trajectory through the remainder of 2017 into 2018 and for the decade ahead. We look forward to sharing more detail with you at our investor conference in New York on November 28. Thank you for joining us and for your continued interest in our enterprise."]], ["I wanted to ask about the OptumCare business but first let me congratulate Andrew on the new role and then given the optimism on future growth here that was discussed, hoping you could put some numbers around the opportunity, maybe share with us the current revenue profile for 2017 that\u2019s expected here? ", ["Justin you seem to have captured all the appropriate themes maybe we'll have Larry start and then Andrew pick that up.\nLarry C. Renfro\nSure. Justin that's a good question and it\u2019s an appropriate question but I thought I might since we're going to talk about growth and maybe give you kind of a general view of growth across Optum for a second and then we\u2019ll get to Andrew but I'm going to ask some other people to talk about growth as well. I'm probably going to bring in Tim Wicks from a financial standpoint. And John Prince from a PBM standpoint and Eric from Optum360. But we\u2019ll lead off with Andrew in a second. There's really just some three areas of what I'd call metrics that we pay attention to when we are looking at our growth across Optum. Number one is are our sales pipeline and I think you hit that and again I'm talking about Optum in general. And our pipeline today is greater than $40 billion and it's a strong, strong pipeline and that's not including what I would call mega deals. This is excluding them but we have a very robust pipeline of about $40 billion.\nOur sales year-to-date is around 23 billion and that 23 billion would compare to last year's sales in 2016 in total of about 30 billion. The year before at about 10 billion so you can see the growth that's taken place from an overall sales perspective. The third area on the metrics would be how we look at our backlog and Eric Murphy will talk about that in a second but it's up and I think I mentioned it in the script 19% and year-over-year about $2.1 billion. So as we have really kicked this year off and what we've done through the first six months has been very robust in all three of those areas. So let me switch over to Andrew and let Andrew talk specifically about what the question that you asked and then we're going to walk through some of the other growth areas as well. Andrew?\nAndrew Hayek\nThanks Larry, good morning Justin. So as you know we have a belief that there's a significant opportunity to improve the quality, the experience, and the cost of healthcare on a national basis creating value for patients and the marketplace. And the experience over the past several years has been that physicians can achieve outstanding results when empowered with the right analytics, tools, and support. And the market is asking for these kinds of models to improve the cost, quality of care. So our approach is to tailor our market presence based on the local factors in each market that we serve, leveraging primary care, urgent care, surgery centers, and house calls, leveraging technology and tools from across Optum to create value for our patients and for our care providers. We are building this in a multi payer manner serving all payers in the markets that we serve and we believe your question that the market potential is very significant, the depth of the issues resolving, the value we can create for patients into the marketplace is very significant, and we look forward to creating a business multiples of our current size.\nTim Wicks\nJustin, it is Tim Wicks, let me jump in as well and talk about overall Optum revenues. So, overall total revenue and unaffiliated revenue growth were both in line with our expectations on the quarter. OptumHealth and OptumInsight together had double-digit unaffiliated revenue growth for the quarter as well. I would point also then to OptumRx and just want to clarify this work in the supply chain that we've been doing is translating into lower drug costs for consumers and customers and that really would translate then into lower external revenue for this quarter even though external scripts were up year-over-year. As you know we never apologized UHC's growth and UHC grew faster in the quarter which is obviously a positive impact to our revenue as well. So as we look at the quarter our revenue and product mix are on plan for yield. Total revenue and external revenue both in line with our expectations.\nJohn Prince\nJustin, this is John Prince, CEO of OptumRx. I just wanted to talk a little about OptumRx and how we are doing. We're halfway through the year. We are hitting our new business targets and we remain very confident about hitting our full year target. Our retention is very strong, we have renewal rates in the high 90's. As Larry mentioned in the script we're very honored about the award from the State of New Jersey. That deal actually brings us more than 700,000 new members. We see a broad trend that large, sophisticated buyers are very attracted to our pharmacy care services model, it is very differentiated in the market. We've had some other normal wins and we have a health plan wins and also we have renewed our health plan clients who are out too this year. We have several new wins through the healthcare transformation alliance which we announced last quarter. I would say overall we are very optimistic about OptumRx's compelling buyer proposition in the market, it is resonating well and we are seeing very good results.\nEric Murphy\nThanks John. Justin, Eric Murphy with OptumInsight. To Larry's point around regarding Optum360 as well as our backlog, regarding Optum360 we are in late stage assessments with four major delivery systems. Our qualified pipeline for Optum360 is up 60% year-over-year. The sales cycles in this side of the market as we've shared in the past are elongated and we're working diligently right now to improve the assessments that we do with our clients and prospects in this area to be able to get to value proposition discovery in the shorter period of time to generate results for these delivery systems. And then finally I would share we\u2019re bullish on where we land for the year regarding backlog of between $15 billion and $16 billion for 2017.\nStephen J.

", ["Sure. John, do you want to respond to that.\nJohn Prince\nSure. David, this is John Prince. I am not sure I followed all the math that you're doing but let me take it at a high level. I think you know I see at the high level happening and if you just look at our external client market is that our number of clients we serve is up, our number of scripts is up but actually the revenue is sort of flat on a per script basis and I think that is really what you see is that the value that we're doing really looking at net best cost for clients as we are delivering that. And I think that is also why our story is resonating in the market in terms of the value that we bring to our clients. What we're also seeing is that even though we're delivering that value our external product gross margin actually is up year-over-year.\nSo actually we're getting the margin online business was driven by that more volume. So we're actually getting greater margin on it but we're actually delivering that value back to the client. When we're going out into the market we're actually talking about not just the pharmacy cost but we're talking about total cost of care. So what you are seeing in the revenue here that\u2019s our story of the market around pharmacy cost but our real value story as you go to market is people looking at total cost of care. And so we actually have a story in the market which we're talking to that actually talks about how we save a client $11 to $16 per month as they talk about our full synchronized solution. And that is what our clients are receiving. In our UHC book about 30% of the clients have that synchronized value. We also do that on a direct basis and also with other partners in terms of other health plans that we served in the market. So, clearly we are seeing a very differentiated value that our clients are seeing in their trend."]], ["First, given all the growth that you have there just want to make sure that the performance from margin across expectation is coming in line with how you had expected it this year?

Let me just talk a little bit about how we're thinking about growth and the positioning of UnitedHealthcare overall and because I think the themes are pretty consistent as we move to a specific Medicare Advantage conversation. But we've been very focused on a specific agenda trying to drive value, improve our quality, very focused on costs both medical and administrative that are really driving an agenda of what we call distinction, trying to innovate around our both our clinical experience and our service experience, driving improved NPS. We see that actually across our businesses but particularly in our MAPD business as well, driving more attention which I think is significantly contributing to the growth and also the inline performance we've seen this year on that growth. But also you just heard the Optum team talk about their robust capabilities as we bring those things into UnitedHealthcare. We continue to see that really resonating in the market across all of our businesses. And so we're really bringing this agenda of distinction to new populations whether we are talking about bringing populations into more populations with complex care, complex conditions into managed Medicaid or some of the emerging populations that we continue to see grow whether it's a D-SNP or group Medicare Advantages as you referenced. So really well positioned across all of these businesses but MA is a tremendous story so with that maybe just have Brian give some color about what we are seeing there early in this year.\nBrian Thompson\nSteve, thank you. Kevin, good morning, this is Brian Thompson. For 2017 we are off to a very strong first half of the year on both service and support as well as our engagement with our new seniors that have chosen UnitedHealthcare.

We expect as you heard to continue to outperform the market in 2018 overall on MA balanced both in group and individual just as we did this year and the two years prior.\nThe return of the insurance fee will be the single largest headwind in 2018, it's return was assumed that our 2018 bid submissions but despite the return of the tax and program funding pressure there, we do intend to keep our benefit offerings as stable as possible and we intend to compliment our 2018 growth and product stability with advances in both quality and satisfaction. So our products will again be designed for high levels of retention.

John Rex here, so when I talked about the 80 basis points of impact, that was truly just the mix impact, a higher proportion of really care delivery businesses in our revenue base and that's the impact that we're seeing in the business. So that is straight up the care delivery business expanding and growing and care delivery business somewhere now in kind of two thirds of the range of all of OptumHealth. There are always investments we're making across the businesses and certainly within our OCR this quarter there were plenty but our commitment to you is to always balance those and as we deliver our results by that point of segment the 80 basis points does not include investments that we make.\nStephen J.

I guess I would try in my response to kind of a discussion of what's here. So I would say the market moves on value, it doesn't necessarily move on price. And we have been very purposeful across our product, our services, the focus on NPS has I think brought a much stronger value proposition to particularly the fully insured small growth market. Long-term disciplined pricing is a good thing and I think you're seeing the discipline that we had in the early stages of the ACA now coming back to us as a value play. Couple that with a very purposeful decision a number of years ago to broaden our product portfolio and to offer a much broader spectrum of network opportunities or choice for particularly our fully insured small group clients.\nWe also have undertaken a different view with our distribution community, our brokers and consultants, a more disciplined approach with them narrowing some of that distribution network to more favorite partners and giving them some added services. So one of the things that we've learned over the years that our brokers and our consultants in that marketplace seek to do business with those that make it easier for them to do business with. We've created again with the assistance of rally and our Optum partners a much easier way for our small business brokers to onboard clients with us, to make plan changes, to recommend using some of the OptumInsight analytics.

", ["Sure. So we'll parse those questions up. I think Dan will talk about...\nDan Schumacher\nSure. Good morning Dave. Obviously, from our perspective, we have been long supporters of the permanent repeal of the health insurers\u2019 tax. At the end of the day, obviously, it just increases the cost of healthcare, makes it less affordable and compromises people's ability to gain coverage. So we are certainly advocating along those lines. As we think about the tax itself, obviously, we\u2019ve got to deal with it as it sits currently in loss, and so that's what we're doing. We're planning accordingly. We're incorporating it in pricing and also incorporating in our thinking as we plan our benefits in Medicare.\nIn terms of timing, there's different timings based on the businesses. So obviously small business, starts to resolve itself clearly now and into May, for next year large group takes later in the commercial process. And then as you look at the Medicare business that first Monday and in June is when we're doing our filing. So as it sits right now, we will plan accordingly and incorporate it. And as you think about, if it were repealed, obviously, we talked about the benefit of the moratorium in 2017 and size that in the $0.25 EPS range. Obviously, when it went out versus when it would come back in, the size of that, if it were to stay, is about a 30% increase in the tax itself. And then obviously, we've done well to grow market share over that time. So you can expect that, if the tax comes back in, it would come back in at a greater impact than what we talked about for '17.

But Larry you can handle it yourself.\nLarry Renfro\nSure. So Kevin, I guess, the way that I would -- let me approach it a couple of different ways. We have put together, obviously, our plans in terms of how we attack the market for the first five years and we\u2019re in the process as we talked about early that we are developing a second generation plan that we\u2019re going forward with right now. When we are looking at sales and we\u2019re looking at growth, we look at certain factors as an organization and pretty much everybody in Optum operates off of these factors; number one, would be the backlog that we talked about being about $2.1 billion year-over-year.\nWe talked about, I guess we didn\u2019t get into what we look at in terms of our sales pipeline that finished 2016 at about $30 billion and that was up from 2015 at about $10 billion. And then you look at our overall sales in terms of the TCV and that was probably what I just said, the $10 billion to the $30 billion in sales and the overall pipeline would be about $30 billion.

But I would tell you, it\u2019s a record quarter in terms of overall sales. Some of the factors that might enter into this, in terms of overall revenue that might make think something that might be a little bit different is that we, as we -- if you just look at Catamaran or you look at what we\u2019re doing in OptumRx.\nWe are absolutely having scale and efficiency that\u2019s driving a better customer -- totally driving better customer value.

Kevin, Tim Wicks, CFO of Optum, just wanted to follow on with what Larry talked about in terms of the integration efforts at OptumRx. I think one of the things that\u2019s really important to understand is that as we continue to drive progress and our integration efforts are deepening, this is really translating into lower drug cost for consumers and customers. And it\u2019s really a key part of the helping us drive earnings growth performance year-over-year.

As far as the end markets and the margins, obviously, we\u2019ve guided to and talked about government based margins in the 3% to 5% range and across their Medicare and Medicaid portfolios that we\u2019re operating within those ranges. And we obviously endeavour to perform towards the high end of that range. And on the commercial business, we\u2019re in the mid to upper single digits, and performing well in that business. And as we think about margin expansion or [audio gap], I would say earnings growth more specifically, we\u2019re looking to orient drive our earnings growth more from volume, so continuing to serve more consumers across our broad and diversified platform. And where there is opportunity, we\u2019ll look to expand margins as well, but feeling good about our positioning in each of our businesses. And better and better Medical Care management, no doubt but commercial and Medicare being strongest and probably Medicaid follow that."]], ["If we could dig down into the cost trend a little bit, you usually give us a breakdown in how much you see in utilization of in-patient versus out-patient, perhaps pharmacy trend. ", ["I'll start out with a few themes and then ask my colleagues on the UnitedHealthcare side to pick it up. But I guess Cheryl a good question and a thoughtful one. We have been seeing a pretty steady movement of services into, and I'll say, the out-patient setting, are out to the community. And we have been following them with the OptumCare platform and encouraging that. And thinking that that is a more ideal setting in which to engage and do those services. And we actually think the care technology is facilitating that. It is the procedures are getting simpler and more advanced, the rehabilitation processes, the care processes and so forth, all play to that. Also I think we've been pretty consistent about suggesting that we've seen more in terms of specialty pharma application, diagnostic testing; and those have been more of the trends in the acute care setting has been.\nAnd I would say that we're pretty hopeful and optimistic that better, let's say, a better formulation or application of resources in the community setting holds a lot of benefit, particularly whereas consumers are becoming more knowledgeable, more information is available to them and they're being more engaged in picking the right settings for the services they need. Dan, you want to pick up on that.\nDan Schumacher\nSure. Thanks, Steve. In addition to, I think what you did well to describe is some of that shift from the acute care setting to ambulatory settings, and that shift that comes from in-patient to out-patient. I think the other place Cheryl that I would point to is a greater investment around physician; so really them at the centre of the care continuum and making investments, and really connecting care in a whole-person way and investing in primary care, in particular. So as we think about the composition of where our spend is going, we do see shifts from in-patient to out-patient, a greater investment towards physician and then obviously some of the comments that Steve made with regard to pharmacy inside it.\nStephen Hemsley\nAnd maybe Andrew, you have some perspectives, new voice and fresh perspective on that?\nAndrew Hayek\nI would echo what's been said. We do see across OptumCare, which of course include SCA and also our neighbourhood care centres. And medical groups, the Option D for more care to occur in the out-patient setting, improving the experience, quality and cost to healthcare, and improving the provider experience. So we're excited about what we see in the opportunity ahead.\nStephen Hemsley\nAnd we\u2019re seeing the consumer more comfortable coming into these venues, and that\u2019s also really encouraging thing, so great question and we\u2019ll continue to focus on that."]], ["Can you give us an update on M&A and new contracts internationally, looks like you just got regulatory approval for another small provider acquisition in Brazil and there are potentially some more assets there for sale. ", ["Sure. We\u2019ll start with Dave.\nDave Wichmann\nSure. Thank you, Mike, it\u2019s a good question. As you have noted, we have been somewhat active in Brazil and we have been over the five year duration that we\u2019ve owned Amil, which we now refer to as UnitedHealth Group Brazil; constituting Amil the benefits business, Americas Servicos Medicos which is our healthcare delivery business and then Optum as an emerging services business there as well.\nWe of course have and we\u2019re very curious about M&A broadly across our business. As you know, we don\u2019t comment specifically on individual targets, but we do see broadly across our business M&A as a way to continue to invest the very strong cash flows of this enterprise. And I would suggest you that our interest are primarily in the Optum services markets, as you see us, particularly investing in OptumCare. And then we do have interest in select very thoughtful capital deployment and international markets, as well as some plug-in work that we'll continue to do at UnitedHealthcare overall. So, that\u2019s what I would suggest you our priorities."]], ["Obviously, you are getting a lot of traction in the market, getting strong growth in Domestic Package and investing more aggressively as you announced today.\nDo you think that these investments accelerate your volume growth looking forward? ", ["Yes, we will, Tom. This is David and I\u2019ll let Kate to follow-up. What I can tell you is we are focused on serving the entire e-commerce ecosystem. And that includes large e-tailers, that includes the large retailers and that includes the SMBs, the thousands and thousands of SMBs that we have to compete and to punch above their weight with the larger companies.\nJust a few things to point out, when it comes to the major retailers, over 90% of the larger retailers utilize our innovative services and we\u2019ve seen their business grow. I\u2019ll just give you a few examples of that target Qurate Retail Group, Macy's, GAP, Kohl's, Best Buy, Overstock. I mean, all of those companies have seen our innovative solutions and we have grown.\nBut where our real passion is in this area is, allowing and enabling small and mid-sized businesses to compete against the bigger companies and that\u2019s where you saw just a straying of announcements yesterday. We made more product and service announcements in 2019 than we made in my entire career at UPS and we are following it this year.\nAnd Kate, I\u2019ll turn it over to you to highlight a few that you want to focus on.\nKate Gutmann\nYes, absolutely. And so, clearly, we are the e-commerce provider of choice and David just brought life to that and focus on the SMBs, the exciting part of our solutions is that we actually are leaning in both on B2B and B2C. The speeding of time and transit help both and fast means, through the weekend. UPS only has the commercial offering for our customers helping the SMB to actually speed through the weekend and also replenish inventory.\nSo very impactful. And you know, these customers have told us, it\u2019s about pace, speed and ease. And the ease is helping them to connect whether they are already existing and that is with Digital Access, that\u2019s exactly what that does it brings together the community of buyers with the SMB sellers and attach My Choice For Business on that.\nIt helps them to control not only their outbound, but their inbound and the more you can do that, you save staffing, you save cost and then that helps them to reinvest into their businesses. So we do see these investments as accelerating growth and we are excited that it is with the structural shift in the Air, also the speed on the Ground and very excited.\nDavid Abney\nYes, there is just two that I want to highlight. One is, we\u2019ve been a e-commerce shipper of choice for over years. This is something that we concentrated on six, seven years ago and we have put the network in place and we will continue. But just two things I think is worth drawing out is, we talk a lot about the structural change of Next Day Air and Next Day in general.\nAnd our extended hours Next Day program where we can pickup \u2013 get late pickups and we can actually serve 98% of the population for our brick and mortar retailers that\u2019s within a 150 miles of their locations. We can cover 98%. That is industry-leading and that is giving them a competitive advantage. It allows them to hit Next Day through their Ground network.\nAnd then \u2013 so that was very important. The other one that we\u2019ve made a lot of announcements about, but we are just speeding through and that\u2019s Access Points and we are adding in the press release, another 1,500 Access Points, new package express centers. What makes this unique is this is in a lot of rural areas, people that don\u2019t have a lot of options and by the time these get implemented with the others we have announced, 92% of the population of the U.S. will be within five miles of our Access Points.\nSo it just gives you some good examples of what we are doing to maintain our status as the e-commerce shipper of choice. Thank you."]], ["And what the other actions that are \u2013 that you are spending money on?\nAnd then, within that shift from two day to next day to now intra-region that Dave was just talking about, how do you plan that world? ", ["Thanks, Ken for the question. Look, we are looking at the SMB initiatives in total as I broke it out, it\u2019s a $0.33 total investment with two objectives. We are trying to accelerate the time and transit. We are going to reach over 80% of our customers and then in addition, expand the weekend coverage.\nSo, rather than breakout the $0.33, we are looking at it in totality as a program. We see it accretive to 2021 and beyond. Maybe I\u2019ll let Juan take a stab at sharing some of the details of the two programs.\nJuan Perez\nYes, thanks, Brian. And as we think about the expansion of weekend delivery services, we started that already in the Q4. The advantage that we have is that we have a well defined integrated network that gives us unprecedented capabilities to be able to enable these services. We are going to leverage the relationship that we have with the USPS.\nDavid made that reference to the Access Point network that we have. It\u2019s a network that\u2019s in place. We\u2019ve already built that technology that supports the integration between UPS and the Access Points. That will make it really easy for us to be able to expand us well in those areas. And again, we will continue to provide services through the network that we\u2019ve already built with the great people that we have supporting those operations.\nScott Childress\nOur next question is an online question coming from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please address UPS\u2019 progress in driving U.S. Domestic B2B share growth and the potential to further expand in 2020?\nKate Gutmann\nThanks so much. This is Kate. So first, we are proud to be the B2B market leader and also to say that we grew B2B for the fifth consecutive quarter. This quarter\u2019s B2B growth was fueled by retailer returns, returns growing 6% with our unmatched portfolio. So you can actually have the flexibility of returns, whether it be label list, package list and also right available on your mobile application.\nSo very excited about the progress that we\u2019ve seen in that space. And then B2B a critical component of that is our healthcare strategy as well as our SMB with a large majority of B2B tied to those. Also David mentioned the structural shift. Structural shift comes with the businesses speeding and that also impacts B2B.\nSo, everything you see us doing with speeding time and transit, through that we can follow that to continuing our success with B2B. Thank you."]], ["Just sort of wondering, can you talk a little bit and I know this the pension headwinds, but a little bit about your thoughts on managing the cost per piece and the revenue per piece in the Domestic business and managing to sort of that spread differential and what we should think about in terms of cost per piece going forward? ", ["Okay. Sure. So, I\u2019ll start with the revenue per piece. First of all, we were excited to deliver the positive operating leverage and George will speak more about that aligning the cost per piece with revenue per piece. As we\u2019ve noted, revenue per piece was affected by weight per piece and customer mix. As we leaned into this structural shift that\u2019s going on in the market, and we will continue to do so.\nWith that, we are seeing speeding, whether it be in the Air services. You saw our Air growth very strong. Three consecutive quarters over 20% with this past quarter at 26% for Next Day and double-digit for deferred. A lot of which by the way is coming from a very broad customer base heavily SMB in that area.\nAnd then, David mentioned that Ground inclusion that we have, which is our extended hours, Next Day Ground and the coverage that we gain, 98% of the population by activating brick and mortar. That will continue.\nSo, shorter zone, some less weight, but solutions that gain the whole portfolio Air and Ground from our customers which will help RPP. And then, we remain committed to growing our price as aligned to our value and our cost per piece.\nGeorge Willis\nHey, Jordan. This is George Willis. And thanks for the question. So, as far as the cost per piece goes, our investments have significantly lowered our structural cost. So in answering your question, you think this is going to continue to drop. We continue to see it improving as well.\nWe are driving productivity gains and we are lowering our unit cost. We did that last year and we expect to do the same thing this year. We are creating excellent leverage as Kate just talked about earlier. And it was \u2013 it actually exhibited last quarter in the fourth quarter. This was evidenced by our cost per piece actually going down 3.2% in the fourth quarter.\nSo we see the benefits in our new facilities. We are going to continue that. We also see the continuous improvement on on-road and in our Air network driven by the new technology and automation."]], ["Can you talk a little bit about the cadence of the investments that you are making, the SMB initiatives and others and is that sort of front-end weighted?\nAnd is that a driver of that sort of weaker than average first quarter? ", ["Yes, it\u2019s Brian. Thanks very much for the question. So it has less to do with the changing of the seasonality. It\u2019s more about the phasing and cadence of the investments we announced. The $0.33 OpEx investment or EPS headwinds that we are putting in. The revenue lag to those startup costs. So, as you think about Q1 and launching the investments, revenue comes a bit later.\nAnd that\u2019s why we are muting EPS in addition in the Supply Chain and Freight business, given the macro backdrop that we are expecting some rebound in the middle to late part of the year. So, those are the two elements impacting the phasing of the guidance."]], ["Or do we think that there is sort of introducing new seasonality to the business with the potentially sort of the growth in your largest customer as a percent of revenue.

So, those are the two elements impacting the phasing of the guidance."]], ["And as you think about the next three year view on CapEx, obviously, these investments announced in the last couple of days have been significant.\nBut this sounds like your part of the capital envelope. ", ["This is David. I\u2019ll take the first part of that question and I\u2019ll turn the CapEx over. So, from an OpEx standpoint, on speeding up the initiatives, this is really about how to increase the asset and lane utilization of our transportation network. It\u2019s about competitiveness, it\u2019s about pricing power. When you have a much faster network, you don\u2019t have to discount as much.\nWe also don\u2019t have to have customized solutions. So we are going to be able to take some of those that we have put over the years to help speed the network. We are going to be able to take that out. But we really see that we are going to get additional business and that was the thing that got our attention so much last year is when we put these first ones in, we way exceeded the return of additional packages than we were going to get.\nSo when you put this infrastructure in place, it\u2019s not fully utilized at first. It takes a while to grow. But based on what we\u2019ve seen last year and what we expect to see this year, the revenue and the pricing power from this move is going to more than take care of the operating cost. That\u2019s why we are boldly saying that this is accretive and it\u2019s accretive in 2021 and we\u2019ve got the \u2013 so far the examples to show that.\nSo let\u2019s turn over to the CapEx side and that's to you, Brian.\nBrian Newman\nThanks, David. And David, thanks for the question. So, with respect to CapEx, you are right. The investments we talk about this morning, Harrisburg et cetera, those are all embedded within our capital guidance and envelope. David talked about the OpEx investment. But in terms of where we are headed on CapEx, you saw we are guiding to about 6.7% in 2020.\nThat\u2019s really coming from a lot of efficiency being driven as we saw in 2019, as well as 2020. We see a glide path eventually moving down towards our historic average of 7%. And ultimately, if you look at the ROIC, which is among the leading industry and really it\u2019s a good investment for the company in terms of the returns.\nSo, hope that gives you a little insight on the CapEx side.\nScott Childress\nWe\u2019ve got a couple of questions on International. Tom Wadewitz from UBS, as well as Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. UPS realized a 150 basis point margin improvement in international package in 21 despite small declines. Is there room left for further margin improvement? And does the recent phase one of the China deal helped in that regard?\nDavid Abney\nI\u2019ll talk about phase one of the China deal and then Nando will go further than that. We think the U.S. China Phase one was a historic agreement, as much for what it kept from happening with additional tariffs being implemented, plus what was covered in the actual agreement and certainly looking forward to working with governments on both sides for Phase two. But a positive start there.\nWhen you take a look at that, and you also take a look at the terminal dues change that is going into effect this year, which is going to allow us with our worldwide economy service to really compete in cross-global e-commerce cross border, I should have said, the e-commerce shipments that we haven\u2019t been able to do before, because of the very low cost of the terminal dues.\nSo that\u2019s gotten addressed and so, we do see some positive momentum and I\u2019ll turn it over to you Nando to talk about the business units.\nNando Cesarone\nSure. Thanks for the questions. Of course, what we look at trade obviously concerns exists, we focused really strongly on making sure that we were growing our operating profits regardless of the macro backdrop. We were able to execute industry-leading margins, create positive leverage and of course, continue our profit growth during the quarter.\nI also want to just thank the International staff globally for the work and how they accomplished all of those things in a very challenging environment. While we saw the volume coming in a little bit differently, of course, we feel very comfortable about the cost reductions and the cost control and how we manage expense, mainly the network efficiency, our revenue quality, but also cost efficiency.\nWe executed 2.8% decrease across all cost categories in International. Long-term targets are 16% to 19%. We are 21%. Higher margins are not exactly the primary goal, but maximize our profits certainly is. So, thanks for the questions. Appreciated."]], ["And I don't want to sound too indelicate or anything, but like why -- could you talk a little bit about the thought process about why now is the right time to maybe step down? ", ["This is David. We are very excited about the progress that we have made and we are going to continue to make in the U.S. I think well-deserved recognition. It was due to the transformation initiatives and due to the investments that we have made and those are going to continue. I think we've done an excellent job with our management team. We've got a blend of people, the long-term UPSers like Rich and Jim and then we also have brought in some very good people from the outside. I see that continuing. We have a strong bench and succession planning is something that that we constantly focus on. And this is a natural progression. We have many people that spend their entire years careers at UPS and we appreciate that. And then we have others that are ready to step in and so we're excited about those opportunities too. So feel good about where we are. We have the team that will handle and that will bring transformation initiatives all the way through. I\u2019m as confident as I can be about that. Thanks David for the question.\nScott Childress\nOur next question is an online question. There is -- from multiple analysts. Can you provide an update and some color around your CapEx guidance?\nBrian Newman\nSo thanks, Scott. Look, UPS has been a good steward of capital. And if you look at the returns from an ROIC perspective, we're roughly double the industry average. We lowered our CapEx guidance as you saw by $500 million this year and a similar amount next year. And that offer 3 points in terms of reflection. One is the reduction is due largely to efficiency gains in buildings across the network and procurement standardization. Second, the change does not affect our transformation or capacity initiatives. And then lastly, the CapEx reduction has enabled us to actually raise our adjusted free cash flow to north of $4 billion for 2019.\nDavid Abney\nAn important thing here is we're just getting more done with less and this is what transformation was intended to do. And we're very happy to see that take place."]], ["I guess just to go back to the macro for a moment, just to ask the question directly; but David or Jim, are you seeing anything in your business or leading indicators within your business that make you more or less concerned about the direction of the U.S. ", ["Okay. This is David and I will certainly talk about it. The global economy remains in growth mode, it's just at a slower pace. And risks are more acute and global industrial production has lowered and we are watching closely to see these trade developments. At the same time, though, that we see the softness, we continue to gain and execute our opportunities as is evidenced by our international results and our domestic results. It's the flexibility of our strategy in our network. A good example of that is we have one of our new large aircraft, 747-8 that was scheduled to operate from China to the U.S. We looked at changing trade flows. We moved it from China to Europe and those are the kinds of proactive steps that we will take. We also have to realize, there are some rays of sunshine that are coming across the horizon. If you compare what we're seeing about Brexit now to the last quarter, the fact that there has been some negotiations between Ireland and the U.K. in between the U.K. and the E.U., it's still to unfold, but we will see this Phase 1 negotiations between the U.S. and China. There are some rays of sunshine there too that we're looking at much more to be developed. The important thing is, regardless of those macroeconomic conditions, we have the flexibility and the agility of our network to meet our customers' needs and we are confident we will continue to do so. Thank you for the question.\nScott Childress\nWe are going to take a online question from Tom Wadewitz of UBS. How does your expanded drone delivery capabilities fit into the strategies that you've got for growth?\nJim Barber\nAs David mentioned in his introduction, we are the first to receive the FAA Part 135. We are the first and still only fully certified drone airline in the United States. We actually begin investing in drones several years ago, since our very first residential trial flight actually in February of 2017. We are moving fast. We are quickly scaling, building on the WakeMed program we have announced yesterday, University of Utah, a similar campus. But we see greater opportunity beyond that. We've announced then three partnerships, CVS, Kaiser Permanente and AmerisourceBergen. In partnership with those companies, we are looking for new services and solutions. We are very excited about the opportunity and we see much more to come in this area as we progress. Thank you.\nDavid Abney\nYes. This Flight Forward and this drone strategy, this is just indicative of our transformation initiatives that we are going to charge forward with new technologies, and we are not taking a backseat to anyone. We've made that clear from the start. But the fact that we've already made 1,500 commercial flights, we're doing it on a day-in, day-out basis and you\u2019re going to continue to hear much, much more from us. So really want to commend Scott and his team. But this is UPS embracing the future and we are very excited about it."]], ["Just wondering if you could discuss, how you feel you're prepared to face that challenge heading into this year, and what you've learned from years past and how you are prepared for this condensed calendar? ", ["Yes, I would like to talk about it. Got a lot of momentum going into peak. It is a shorter peak season, there is no doubt about it. But that didn't just happen over the last few weeks, right? I mean we've known that for years, and so, the capacity that we've added for the past couple of years, we've added 5 million square feet. We've added 400,000 packages an hour capacity over the last two years. And whether it's Jim or Juan, we can talk a little bit more about the peak network in just a second. But the fact that we have buildings in place, we have the plans to hire the people and the fact that we've got momentum, we feel really good about that.\nJuan Perez\nYes. And thank you, David. Another couple of points here. We continue to refine our delivery models to improve our overall capacity. This year we will be using an extended -- more impactful personal vehicle driver model across the network, that will add capacity for delivery. In addition to that, the investments we continue to make on technology, like Orion navigation, will make a significant impact in the way that we are going to manage delivery capacity this year because that type of technology just adds additional efficiencies to the way that we complete our deliveries. So to David's point, capacity in our facilities combined with capacity on the delivery side, puts us in a really good position to execute well.\nScott Childress\nWe are going to take a online question. This question comes from Amit over at Deutsche Bank. He wants to ask about UPS' relationship with Amazon, and the company's ability to lean into Amazon volume?\nDavid Abney\nYes, this is David. I would say that years ago, we made a decision to lean into e-commerce, and there is no doubt about that. And at that time that I think others were considering or had other plans. When we say lean, we are talking about across the e-commerce ecosystem. So it is small and mid-sized businesses, it's other e-tailers and retailers and that includes Amazon. But it is not specific to any one company. When it comes to dealing with large customers that have a lot of volume and that they do some in-sourcing themselves, is really how you negotiate the deal and how you structure the contract, and how you set your pricing that you can help influence the behavior that you want to drive. But the real key to e-commerce, and you can see it in our innovative solutions that we just rolled out, with the Digital Access program and the way we are expanding worldwide economy, is helping small and mid-sized companies worldwide compete with the big retailers and e-tailers. And that is the key to our success. And thus what we are driven to lean into, more than in any other areas. So, e-commerce is here to stay. We've embraced it. We've got a head start and we will continue it. So thank you for the question."]], ["How do you think about the greater growth in e-commerce and in, I presumably in that Next Day category, looking forward or continued growth as you saw in second quarter and how that might affect the margin outlook in domestic package? ", ["Tom, this is Kate. Thanks for the question. And we do see the structural change in the market, the 2-day commitment to the shift or 1-day commitment drives the air and ground. As we\u2019ve just talked about, that extend the Next Day ground coverage that we do and you see the growth that occurred in both. We believe SMBs are going to follow and they\u2019re going to be empowered by some of these solutions. So the growth while at the levels that caught your attention this morning may not be the same in the future. We do believe the structural change continues and it will be strong growth in the future. Richard, you want to answer margins?\nRichard Peretz\nSo when you think about margin, we do and we continue to call for improvement in operating margin for the U.S business. It's driven by the efficiencies across the network both the ground and the air with the new buildings and you saw what cost per piece this quarter and that 0.5% is among the lowest that\u2019s been in several years and we expect that to continue. We are calling for low double-digit operating profit growth in all three segments for the entire year. And so when you put it altogether, we expect the second half to be well. We do believe that the Next Day Air will continue to grow, but that growth started really in the first quarter if you look at our growth numbers there. It was a little higher in the second quarter. We don't expected to stay that high through the rest of the year. But we do expect to continue to win share based on the solutions we have in the market and will help margins."]], ["Richard, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how the investments in service going to seven day speeding up the road network, which I would presume means taking something off the train, putting it onto a truck.

At the same time, this is a very real structural change occurring. And so you just couldn't have that line up any better than it has and now we're taking advantage of that. And Jim, you want to talk a little bit more about the capacity?\nJim Barber\nWell, I do think you said it very well, David. In that the 11 that we're bringing on this year, the 11 that we're going to bring on next year of seven fours and seven sixes, it's time for everything. I mean, we spent a lot of time talking about a couple of trade lanes in the world, but we should also focus on what this world is doing crossing borders and growing and our participation in this global network. Remember, everything that we are flying around this world doesn\u2019t end up in the United States of America. There's a lot of South -- South trade that goes involved in this and we can move the assets there. We have the flexibility as we talked about. And when it moves in this case, potentially the structural changes in the U.S., you can move the assets. And of course, it's not all physical, it's also block hours. I would also say that if you look at this year back to the efficiency metric, it's not just about buying more of them. Our block hours were up about 50% as high as our volume in the U.S this year, so that's another efficiency metric. And if you look at our utilization rates, they're higher this year than last year. So we think the timing as David said is really spot on for.\nScott Childress\nWe are going to take another online question. This is from multiple users. Is the USPS able to handle the additional delivery that with the expanding U.S services?\nDavid Abney\nRight. This is David. And I'm assuming just talking about Sunday delivery where we are utilizing our own network, we are utilizing access points and we are utilizing USPS to from a SurePost expansion. And I can tell you that that I personally got -- gotten a commitment from the top USPS that they understand our requirements and the needs of our customers and their outflows are committed to work with us to make sure that this is going to be a very successful offering. So I couldn't be any more confident in our Sunday delivery capabilities, all three parts of the strategy, including the commitment from USPS to perform at the levels we need. Thank you."]], ["Your second quarter guidance is \u2013 flat earnings is different from what the Street has been looking for, but I don\u2019t know if that reflects any change in your view of how domestic package is going to perform during the year or if that\u2019s just kind of a timing difference the Street didn\u2019t recognize? ", ["Sure, Tom. This is Richard. I\u2019ll start the question and then Jim will talk a little bit about it. If you look at the actual guidance we do see 2019 as a year of real progress. The quarters are changing a little bit, but they were in our plans that way. We wanted to make sure that you had the right visibility and understanding with transformation. The quarter\u2019s changed because we\u2019re opening new buildings in the second quarter that drive benefits in the second half of the year. In the third quarter, we\u2019ve got those new buildings. We see escalating efficiency in the buildings we opened in late 2018. We have the extra work day. We have the commodity tailwind versus last year and we have the DRP, a full run rate in the third quarter. Those are all good proof points of why the year sets up well and the second half operating profit growth will lead to the double digit operating growth that we expect for 2019 in U.S.\nJim Barber\nTom, it\u2019s Jim. Let me add something to what Richard opened with and just to remind you that this year \u2013 when we came out of the gate, we said 2019 in the U.S. is about creating operating leverage. And you can start to see that in the first quarter if you look at the cost structure. To remind you of a couple other points that are beneath that and we think are important. First of all, hand-in-hand with that comes our service. Our service is at very high levels relative to the competition and even for ourselves over the last couple of years. We\u2019re pretty proud of the service and by the way that leans into cost as well, because if you do things right the first time it\u2019s actually cheaper and we provide the customers the great service. We\u2019ll keep on the revenue quality. Kate and others will talk about that as we go forward. The transformation [non-ops] [ph] is coming through. The efficiencies are coming through. We\u2019re focused on almost 80% of our network touching automation by the end of this year which is very good going forward. Remember, we got 323 ground Saturday operations running in full flight this year and you just keep going and then you\u2019ll hear more in the future about peak season. So for us as we move forward and to the margins Rich talked about, you should start to see us perform better and better and better on operating leverage in the U.S. and that\u2019s our commitment to our shareholders this year."]], ["I know Amazon\u2019s always a topic of discussion but they\u2019ve been getting bigger and bigger in sourcing and we\u2019ve heard from whether New England Motor Freight or XPO that they brought business in.

When you look at the revenue especially in the U.S., what we see is underlying growth about 4.5% but we recognize we had weather and operating day change as well as the movement of Easter. So the organic growth was strong. When you look at what we\u2019re doing in opening new buildings we\u2019ve called out in the past as we open buildings, we do have certain startup costs that go into those buildings. By opening that 30% in the second quarter to total 50 by end of the third quarter, what we\u2019re really doing is making sure that as we move into the fourth quarter the efficiency gains that we\u2019re seeing right now in the new buildings, we\u2019re also seeing in this year, in the second half of the year as we especially go into third and fourth quarter. Those startup costs are around things that you would expect as we hire and train people, as we put in the last bit of supply tools and needs, things like that. So those were all part of what we put into the second quarter, what we expect out of the third quarter and fourth quarter. It\u2019s very deliberate in the third quarter and you see benefits from these new buildings as well as the other things I\u2019ve called out. And with that, I think that kind of tell you about why guidance and why we believe 2019 will be so well. And I\u2019ll turn it over to David.\nDavid Abney\nYes, Richard. When it comes to Amazon, we have to remember a very large company. They in-source and out-source different portions of their transportation network. As they grow they continue to change and add those vendors. We do not believe that there\u2019s been a decrease in our volume levels due to them making a switch from one company to another. We still have a mutually beneficial relationship with Amazon and we feel that while we continue to focus on serving their needs that there is so much more to e-commerce than Amazon and we also have shared how we\u2019re focusing on working with these other companies, SMBs and so we\u2019ve shared that at the end of last year and it\u2019s just a continued focus on improving the revenue quality.

But ground RPP was actually at 2.9% in the U.S., strongest quarter we have had first quarter growth in four years. And then if you look to your question, we had above market air growth rates which we actually saw a broad base of customer usage; small and medium-sized business, healthcare related as well as of course retail. And yes, to the question on mix, we saw more saver growth specifically within nexAir [ph] product and that can impact revenue per piece as well as a shorten zone which impacts that, but it\u2019s just less of a flight path that the package takes.

", ["Sure. So I think the first thing we look at is, UPS generates strong operating cash flow. We think 2019 will be another good year. Last year, we started doing initiatives around working capital and we saw that benefit. Those working capital initiatives, we have additional ones on the list that we\u2019ll continue to complete and as we complete those, we will share the results and a go-forward look at that. Now, you did hit on this permanent shift. And what that means is we actually have better cash flow in the fourth quarter going forward because of the long-term value of the transformation initiatives we put in place. But most importantly as we do see upside potential, we\u2019re implementing initiatives. And as they come through, we\u2019ll start sharing that a little bit more. In terms of the CapEx side of it, our CapEx really is about improving the efficiency of our network and at the heart of that is both the technology and the buildings that we\u2019re creating. So this year, we expect to spend about $7 billion, we spent $1.5 billion in the first quarter which is right in line with where we expected and we\u2019ll continue to lean into that. We talked about this year level being about where we just talked about a moment ago, and it\u2019s really about driving efficiency and lowering costs in the network over the long term and we do expect and we are seeing some of that now, and we\u2019ll see even more of it in the second half of the year."]], ["I want to come back to the longer-term CapEx outlook because I think at prior events you guys have spoken about spending in the 8.5% to 10% of revenue range for the next few years. ", ["So, Brandon, this is Richard. I think on the CapEx side, I\u2019ll take that part. And then I\u2019ll have Juan talk a little bit about the actual buildings. But on the CapEx side, you\u2019re right. We talked about a three-year peak of CapEx and then it\u2019s moderating down. We\u2019re still on plans for that. It\u2019s just a little early to give you what we\u2019re going to do in 2020 and 2021. But we continue to look at different options and alternatives based on the flow of packages and really the benefits we\u2019re getting out of these buildings, which are slightly better than we originally thought even. So it\u2019s a little too early to give that but at the same time, what we\u2019ve guided in terms of three years and then coming down, that moderation will occur. And at the appropriate time we\u2019ll give a better feel for that. But I\u2019ll turn it over to Juan to talk about the actual buildings.\nJuan Perez\nSure, Richard. Close to 60% of our planned building automation projects by 2022 are already completed. That\u2019s on the large building automation type projects. And as David alluded earlier, we\u2019re already seeing the types of benefits that we get from these automation in the network. Close to 65% of our small sort automation projects that we targeted by 2022 are also completed. And in both scenarios, we\u2019re actually on track to get to the targets that we defined to have solid automation across our network to provide benefits to the organization."]], ["Richard, first, if you can just kind of review the comments you made about the vesting change in impact and then kind of the \u2013 I guess the lower discount benefit, if you can just review those comments?\nAnd then, within domestic packets, how do we think about the impact of that favorable mix into SMB, B2B? ", ["Tom, what I'm going to do is I'm going to cover the MIP and the discount rate and then I'm going to turn it over to Kate to talk a little bit about where we\u2019re headed with some of the initiatives around our customer and product mix.\nSpecifically, around the vesting, it really is about a short-term stock equity program that 40,000 employees participate in. The legacy was, it was a five year vesting and it wasn't meeting the market. And it\u2019s transformation we continue to look at. How do we make UPS attractive place to work, get the right talent and also make sure we\u2019re delivering appropriately from a compensation standpoint? So, part of that was making the change. It really is no overall impact when you go through the five years. There is a little bit heavier charge now and then slowly dissipates to zero by the fifth year.\nIn terms of the discount rate, that $250 million is pretty much offset by the benefit we saw in the operating line on discount rate. So, in the press release, we call out the below-the-line portion. And while it\u2019s not entirely the same as the MIP, a large portion of the MIP is offset by that. And that's because the service cost portion is accrued differently when the discount rate rises. So, that\u2019s all inside the operating line.\nBut, most importantly, I think when you look overall, the operating growth in the low double digits is a big improvement for the US and it's not just what\u2019s happening in the operating leverage, but what we\u2019re doing with revenue and Kate will talk about that.\nKathleen Gutmann\nThanks. And, Tom, I\u2019ll just add, both customer and product mix was positive in the quarter and, yes, tied to our strategy of revenue quality. And we continue to align value price and cost. And going further with different industries, different segments, further with small and medium-size businesses, and be more selective with large customers. So, the strategy is playing out and will continue to do so."]], ["So, maybe help us think about why \u2013 what's changing and why it doesn't show up in the beginning of the year and why it comes more in the back half of the year?\nAnd then, can you just walk us through the pieces? ", ["Okay. Scott, I'll start with the guidance specifically. I think you're calling out the first quarter. The two big factors in the first quarter are, first, the workdays and Easter move from the first quarter to the second quarter. So, if you go back and look in history, there's a volume run up prior to Easter, and that plays into it. And then just the workday. There's one less workday in the first quarter. And when you do the math to the third quarter, you'll see the pickup because there\u2019s an extra workday in the third quarter.\nIn terms of when you think about the free cash flow, we had called out some working capital initiatives that we\u2019re going to continue and we talked about that, but also we know, in 2018, there were some past benefits that we called out in March, both for the tax rate change as well as a big refund.\nSo, when you kind of normalize for that, we\u2019re going to have an excellent year of free cash flow again. We\u2019re going to continue to try to build that. And we talked about additional opportunities to grow it through some of the initiatives. And as we do daily in 2018, we\u2019ll share those accomplishments and what it means to free cash flows as the year goes.\nJames Barber\nYeah. Just to follow up on the first quarter, there are no business fundamental issues with the first quarter. Rich certainly pointed out the two things about the calendar.\nThe other thing is these discrete tax items that hit the first quarter of last year that don't this year. So, other than that, we see the first quarter with the same momentum as the rest of the year.\nScott Childress\nWe\u2019re going to take an online question here. This comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Did you progress in your pursuit of growing share with small and medium-size businesses this peak season?\nKathleen Gutmann\nSo, thanks, Scott, for the question. This is Kate. And the answer is yes. Our strategy is working. Our small and medium-size business growth was the best we've seen in recent history in the US as well as throughout the world and across different industries. And you can see that demonstrated in our notable B2B and B2C growth. The sales and marketing teams continue to work very well together to win more in the market. And it is notable that we\u2019re the market leader already in small and medium-size businesses, but we\u2019re delivering more solutions to go even further.\nJust to give you a little flavor, Where To Go, we\u2019ve talked about, but there is strong demand as we build out our merchant network. UPS My Choice just hit an amazing 56 million of happy consumers and we\u2019re going to be extending that to UPS My Choice for Business later this year. So, very excited about that.\nAnd then, also, the alliances Jim mentioned in the opening, the Shopify integrating UPS services into that system, ShopRunner bringing two-day delivery across the country for different retailers, Inception and then Optoro on the return side. And continuing to enhance how we reach these small and medium-size businesses globally through digital solution.\nSo, SMBs are the growth engine for economies throughout the world and we are very well positioned to continue our success in that segment. Thanks so much.\nDavid Abney\nAnd this is David. Just a quick summary about the importance of SMBs. They are 95% of the firms and they are 50% of US GDP. So, when Kate talks about all these initiatives, it\u2019s because that\u2019s such an important selector and, of course, it is one of our strategic imperatives.\nScott Childress\nWe\u2019re going to take another online question. This question is from Ravi Shankar from Morgan Stanley and Amit [ph] at Deutsche Bank. What percent of your US volume is being sorted manually today and what do you see going forward? As well as, can you give us an update on the 22 facilities you brought online this year?\nGreat. Good morning. This is Juan Perez. Thanks for the question. We continue to make significant progress in expanding our automated capacity across the network. And just as a reminder, that is a key component of the buildout of our Smart Logistics Network, which we\u2019re really proud of the progress we've be making up to this point.\nNow, to tell you how that progress has materialized, at the end of 2018, we had nearly 70% of our ground eligible volume going these automated facilities. In 2019, we expect that number to grow to almost 80%. And to put it in perspective, back in 2017, we were only at about 50%. So, continued progress in that area.\nNow, to do that, we successfully \u2013 and Jim mentioned it, we successfully completed our 22 automated facility projects in 2018. That was a global project footprint. They accounted for more than 5 million square feet in capacity across the network. For those who are in the US, 1 million was in international. That added 400,000 packages per hour of capacity in one year across the network. The regionals in Atlanta and Salt Lake City in Phoenix, they just provided excellent capacity support in these areas. And on top of all that, we added 2,300 car positions to the US network, again, giving us additional capacity to support the Smart Logistics Network.\nIn 2019, that would be another busy year for us in building capacity. We\u2019re excited about it again. Jim mentioned 18 US facilities that will be coming online. In total, we\u2019ll have 20 because we have some international facilities as well coming online. Seven automated small sorts. We will be adding an additional 400,000 packages per hour of capacity. And critical areas where we see significant growth will see additional capacity as well. Tennessee, California, Kentucky and Ohio. So, we continue to move forward with our strategy. We feel pretty solid about it."]], ["And it feels like within the guidance, you guys are getting some of the productivity that you are expecting, some of the return on these investments, but they're being offset by the below-the-line pension, they're getting offset by this change in the stock comp at $0.51 that you\u2019ve called out. ", ["Sure, David. This is Richard. And I think the first thing that we have to think about is, if you just look at what happened really the stock market in the last six weeks of the year, that's predominately what's driving a tremendous amount of the pension below-the-line impact. So, I'd love to sit here and tell you that we\u2019re not going to see \u2013 we\u2019re going to see a positive market that\u2019s X, Y or Z, but I do understand that what we look at \u2013 what December looks like, it was a stock market that was, for the month, worse since, I believe, the Depression. And so, that had a big impact at the end of the year that wasn't expected. I don't expect that to repeat. And because of that, I do believe \u2013 and if you think about the underlying real story here, it is that we have double-digit low teens growth in all three segments. And it's been many years since you've seen that. We are at the pivot point of the benefits from transformation, the investments. And, most importantly, our return on invested capital remains within our range."]], ["And then, also, in terms of the domestic cost per piece, if you could parse out what the efficiency gains were during the quarter, maybe the operating penalties themselves and fuel and any other components? ", ["Sure, Allison. This is Richard. I think the first thing, we did call out a number for the year for operating penalty. It came in pretty close to where we had expected. We had called it out during the quarters. And if you look at December, while we\u2019re slightly below where we expected to be, mostly because of what happened in November with a really strong December, those penalties that we expected, they came. We expect some penalties again this coming year because we\u2019re opening up almost the same number of buildings, but it\u2019s not going to be as much of a drag because we\u2019re getting the benefits, and we talked about the year-over-year.\nIn terms of the cost per piece and the changes, I think with what we've given you, you can calculate the cost per piece. You can see the inflation numbers or the increases coming down. You could even look at our operating expenses this quarter and it was among the lowest that we've had in the last two years.\nWith that, I think perhaps getting into the model and the numbers, I think we can take this conversation offline and talk about the incremental pieces that you\u2019re asking."]], ["So just wanted to see if you could help us to understand what pricing actions you took and how we might think about the kind of volume outlook relative to what you're doing on price and maybe kind of how far along you are on pricing. ", ["Thanks, Tom. This is Kate. I'll take that question. And I'll start with the volume side of it. We continue to see solid volume growth. If you look at the two-year stack for both the first quarter and second quarter, it's over 7%. Do note that Easter moved between the quarters which I think is the impact you're referring to, but we continue to see that solid volume growth and across all sectors, healthcare, industrial, as well as consumer goods.\nTied to the pricing actions, we also saw strong pricing this quarter with U.S. base rates up 3.3% without fuel. And in the quarter, to your point, we implemented more pricing actions, really focused on oversized and large residential packages which drive higher cost to serve. And just as an example, LPS, the two-year stack on pricing action, has been 18.5% because of that cost to serve and we, in July, added a length dimension, so a length over 96 inches as well as Residential Delivery charge as well. Just as two examples. So, we are seeing those as specific targeted rate actions. We do not see an impact on volume, and we continue to see solid results in both areas. Thanks."]], ["As you think about the outlook going forward, assuming no dramatic shift in economic activity, assuming no dramatic shift in the interest rate environment, do you think that the burden on cash from operations from pension contribution is still going to be high?\nAnd I guess I'm wondering. ", ["Sure, David. I think the first thing to remember here is that UPS has always had a philosophy of making sure we give a good return to our shareholders.

Another hallmark of UPS is investing in the business, and you've heard some of our plans both for the aircraft and the buildings, and that's really about the growth.

So although incorrect information comes out, we certainly correct that. But we have the right people negotiating on our end. I think that the more successful UPS is, the more that we can hire additional Teamsters and the better jobs that our people will have. So just like any negotiations, there's give-and-take, there's good days and bad days, but overall I feel confident that we certainly can reach an agreement.\nJames Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nThis is James. I'd just add a couple of points to reinforce what David said. Remember we have shared objectives here. It's to create jobs and have career opportunities and serve customers, and that's been going on for many decades. I think the uniqueness of what comes into play now as well is the pace of change and the need for continued flexibility to be adaptive. And so working together with the Teamsters that will be some of the highlighted areas we go forward and get done, and hopefully get it done in the short order. But I think David's points are very right on the point about how the negotiation will transpire going forward, so."]], ["It really from the outside seems that UPS, under your leadership over \u2013 I don't know \u2013 the past year or maybe longer is taking more aggressive steps than you have in the past. ", ["Okay, Tom. Thanks for the question. I'll take the first part of it, then I'll hand it over to Richard. And I do agree with the way you position the question. And I think the longer we wait to take on some of these challenges, which are also opportunities, the more defensive position we would be in. We made a conscious decision that we needed to take an offensive position, and we needed to readjust our strategic initiatives, and we needed to ramp up our investments and we needed to \u2013 I'd call it, supercharge the level of change that we are doing in our company. We have this proud company that's been very successful, and we're all glad to be a part of that.\nBut we issued a challenge to our people, and that was that if we continue to do business the same way we do today, and this was a year or two ago, that we didn't see as rosy a future for the company or for the shareholders as we would if we took a much more aggressive stand that if we charged into the future and that's what you've been seeing as do the last 1.5 year or so. And that's what we will continue to do. Take ourselves out of our comfort zone, address the opportunities that have been given in front of us. Richard, why don't you give a few examples of what I'm talking about?\nRichard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nWhen we look right now, we know that we're in the first year of a three-year, we call it, peak capital. And what you see in 2018 is you're going to get a lot of capacity that we haven't really seen added to the network. And that's all going to come in the second half of the year. So we've got a lot of the upfront expense in our numbers, with the benefits start layering-in in 2019 and in 2020. And that's one of the reasons that we called out specifically that the op expense and the Saturday capability were investments.\nWe're now looking right now at about 50% of the population on Saturday. A year ago, we were effectively at probably under 3% or 4% of the population on Saturday. So when you look at the op expense, you kind of see things like that going on along with the step-up costs required as you open a building before the building opens.\nWhen we look at the quarter itself, what we recognize is on an apples-to-apples basis, we do see the business about where it was last year. But understand that it's being masked because you've got about $230 million in the domestic that was a credit that is no longer in the operating margin. You've got discount rate change, the weather, along with all these investments. But underlying or masking all of our underlying performance, are these callouts? And we do have a deliberate strategy over the next few years to continue to see benefits, to improve both the margin and leverage, and I think that's coming through the pricing information Kate talked about, the initiatives, both transformation and the smart logistics network, as well as the efficient use of that capital that's coming in. Thank you.\nScott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nWe're going to take an online question. This question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen. And her question is as you think about the investments you are making for the long-term, are you confident that you're getting ahead of the growth?\nJuan R. Perez - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nGood morning. Thanks for the question. A couple of things that we wanted to mention on that question. First, we're very busy building capacity and capabilities to support growth and continue to build out our smart logistics network. To support that growth, we're building not only regional hubs, but we're also modernizing facilities. We're bringing more automation into play. We're increasing capacity, all with good return on investment. Just to give you an example, in 2018 alone, we will be opening 18 new or modified facilities, and we will also be increasing capacity in our small sorts with the opening of multiple small sorts.\nIn total this year, we will have an additional new 5 million square feet of sort capacity, and that's not only for the Domestic side. We're also building out for International 1 million square feet in places like Paris, Eindhoven, and Montr\u00e9al. And I would say here in the U.S., places that definitely need that capacity, like Atlanta, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Kentucky, Florida, they will all some good necessary capacity. We have more projects coming in line in 2019 and 2020. And we will continue to review trends to make adjustments as needed. Thanks for the question.\nJames Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nI want to add a point. This is Jim. Real quick on the point is that as we build capacity, there are some key priorities that we have to keep in mind, and that is that what goes in the networks have to be right for the network to drive the right ROIC. We've talked about that concept here this morning. And we do think, by the way, as package sizes are changing across global supply chains, it's where some of the unique opportunity exists to start going across business units, and leverage the power of our supply chain business next to our express business, next to the domestic businesses. So yes, it's about capacity, but it's also making sure that the right products are going in the right networks at the right price points to drive the ROICs and our shareholders' return, and we're confident that a lot of this transformation is going to take us there.\nScott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nLet's take another online question. This question is coming from Jairam Nathan from Daiwa. His question is, do you see Amazon extending its presence in your sector through Ship with Amazon initiatives, and is that a lingering issue for the industry?\nDavid P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nThis is David. It's very hard to predict what Amazon or any other of our large shippers are going to do. And we make sure that we evaluate any market moves, whatever impact it would have on our business, and then we monitor and we react accordingly.\nWhen it comes to e-commerce, we really feel that we are the vendor of choice. It's a fast-growing opportunity that we're best-in-class and our network is scalable, difficult to match because of the density and our diverse customer base.\nAnd when it comes to the B2B side of the business, we can talk about B2C so much that we sometimes just don't mention the fact that we are the largest shipper of B2B. It is right in our sweet spot. And we work with all customers, large and small, and marketplace and traditional retailers, and we will continue to do so. So we think we have a good relationship, mutually beneficial relationship with Amazon, but we're open for business for all retailers, big and small. And thank you for the question."]], ["I think we can look at that in terms of the pace of change at the management committee level, a higher CapEx budget, more aggressive investments, you've got the transformation initiatives.

We have more projects coming in line in 2019 and 2020. And we will continue to review trends to make adjustments as needed. Thanks for the question.\nJames Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nI want to add a point. This is Jim. Real quick on the point is that as we build capacity, there are some key priorities that we have to keep in mind, and that is that what goes in the networks have to be right for the network to drive the right ROIC. We've talked about that concept here this morning. And we do think, by the way, as package sizes are changing across global supply chains, it's where some of the unique opportunity exists to start going across business units, and leverage the power of our supply chain business next to our express business, next to the domestic businesses. So yes, it's about capacity, but it's also making sure that the right products are going in the right networks at the right price points to drive the ROICs and our shareholders' return, and we're confident that a lot of this transformation is going to take us there.\nScott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nLet's take another online question. This question is coming from Jairam Nathan from Daiwa. His question is, do you see Amazon extending its presence in your sector through Ship with Amazon initiatives, and is that a lingering issue for the industry?\nDavid P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nThis is David. It's very hard to predict what Amazon or any other of our large shippers are going to do. And we make sure that we evaluate any market moves, whatever impact it would have on our business, and then we monitor and we react accordingly.\nWhen it comes to e-commerce, we really feel that we are the vendor of choice. It's a fast-growing opportunity that we're best-in-class and our network is scalable, difficult to match because of the density and our diverse customer base.\nAnd when it comes to the B2B side of the business, we can talk about B2C so much that we sometimes just don't mention the fact that we are the largest shipper of B2B. It is right in our sweet spot. And we work with all customers, large and small, and marketplace and traditional retailers, and we will continue to do so. So we think we have a good relationship, mutually beneficial relationship with Amazon, but we're open for business for all retailers, big and small. And thank you for the question."]], ["But when you look at what's coming on in the back half of the year, it seems like you should have some pretty good operating momentum into 2019 and obviously beyond. ", ["Matt, I think the first thing to remember is that $4.5 billion to $5 billion we did call out that the tax helped us, and that's one of the reasons we've had actually the best free cash flow we've seen in more than a decade for this quarter.

But I just can't give you enough information yet because we're still finalizing some plans on some of the transformation as well as other strategic initiatives we have that we need to vet out before I give the guidance on 2019."]], ["Richard, I wanted to see if you could add some more perspective on cash flow and how you are thinking about uses of cash, probably like -- maybe both 2018 and if you want, 2019? ", ["Sure. So, to step back for a moment, Tom, our priorities haven\u2019t changed. The number one priority is to reinvest in the business. We have maintained and continue to perform a return on invested capital that is the best in the industry. We also think the dividend is an important component of our capital structure. And as I mentioned in my talk, with Board approval, we expect to keep growing the dividend.\nAnd at the same time, flexibility is important in the balance sheet. The way I look at it is, we made a $5 billion contribution at the end of the year, really for three reasons. And one of them was it was tax efficient. That contribution was made at a time when you write it off at the higher tax rate of the legacy rate versus the new rate. Second, it improves cash flow, not only this year, but likely for the next few years. And then third, it lowers costs.

", ["Sure. Again, Chris, this is Richard. And I think, the first thing you have to look at is, there are -- and we talked about between 25% and 30% growth from 2013 until this year, when we finally first took another plane. If you think about the value creation of our air products and our international products, and it\u2019s apparent that that\u2019s an area where we want invest as much as we can, as often as we can, because it does bring return very quickly to the bottom-line. And so, now, we\u2019re going to have a total of almost 28, 747s, as well as about seven 767 that we\u2019ve announced.\nAt the end of the day, the next few years, we expect these kind of levels, somewhere between 9% and 10%, 8.5% and 10% of revenues to stay. In fact, our plans right now for the next three year are stay pretty much as these kind of levels. And it\u2019s accretive to the business and then you get the 100% deductibility for your investments. If you go back a few years, we kind of announced almost something similar in the International business where about -- by the end of this year will be about 75% of the way through the investments and we\u2019re all seeing the kind of results we\u2019re getting out of that. So, we see that as a good proof point. And with that as the technology and what we\u2019re doing in the business, we believe that these are the right places to put the dollars; it\u2019s got the best return on invested capital; and it\u2019s going to bring the return that we expect.\nDavid Abney\nAnd just one small point to add is that if you\u2019ve been following us for quite a while, then you do know that we\u2019ve had these kind of elevated CapEx percent of revenue before. It\u2019s just that over the recent five or six years we\u2019ve been at this lower level. But, if you look at a longer timeframe, you\u2019re going to see that this is not really an exception; this is maybe slightly higher, but very close to what we have averaged. So yes, for the next few years, we are really growing our international export business and our premium products. We see that this is an opportunity to take advantage of that and we are certainly going to do so.\nScott Childress\nWe\u2019re going to take another online question. This one is from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Bascome has, what led to the external executive hire of Scott Price, Chief Transformation Officer, what objectives has management set, and is there any time horizons that you can gave us?\nDavid Abney\nOkay. This is David. I\u2019ll answer. And we are very happy to have Scott with his experience come and join us. We have brought people in from the outside on many occasions from outside the Company, we never, at this level, but we believe with the pace of change, and that is just good to maybe add to our expertise with a little bit of external perspective, although Scott has been in the industry for quite a while.\nOur focus is going to be on growing the business, on finding efficiencies throughout the business and creating opportunities for our Company and our employees. But, we have to examine all parts of our business. So, if there is one thing that I made it very clear to Scott is that there is an open canvas, there is nothing protected; I want to examine all parts of our business. We are rapidly moving through our evaluation stage now. I focus on rapidly because Scott\u2019s spend here six weeks or so and he is really made a lot of gains and he is working quickly with our team. We are identifying multiyear value creation opportunities. And we will be sharing more, later in the year, really excited about this opportunity, and Scott has the full support of the entire management team. Thank you.\nScott Childress\nWe\u2019ve got another online question here, this one from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Can you give us some more updates on the efficiencies generated with ORION and the other technologies that you are implementing?\nMyron Gray\nYes. So, this is Myron. We are implementing key operations technologies; that\u2019s a multiyear process. We anticipate that when fully deployed, these technologies will result in 800 to a $1 billion annually at full implementation. This includes ORION, NPT, EDGE, as well as the facility automation. As we continue to build out this network of the future, it will certainly provide us with greater flexibility, greater connectivity to our customers, and capacity and efficiency. This year, we will continue to roll out Phase 2 of ORION, which obviously is dynamic route optimization to over 130 centers and 1,400 drivers. Phase 1 of ORION, we netted greater than our expected targeted savings of 6 to 8 miles per driver and over $410 million."]], ["What in hindsight, and then going forward, what needs to be changed or adjusted on that ability to control the volumes, or is it if volumes come, we just need to take it and scale the network as quick as possible? ", ["Thank you, Ken. This is Kate. I\u2019ll take that. You are correct. The collaboration as well as the control tower in forecasting that we did with our customers this year actually increased in collaboration. Also, we added location level planning to this. And for the peak period, it actually worked very well. The forecasts were aligned and the control tower, which is the request of the large customers to go above their forecast, worked well. The example of that is peak week, as David mentioned, worked especially well during those critical last few days to do the wrap up, and gave us a strong finish.\nBut Cyber Week and weekend was the exception, and definitely more demand in the market than planned. You may have seen that the National Retail Federation noted that holiday retail sales came in 5.5% or almost 45% higher than their forecast. And that marks the fastest pace of growth in the post-recession era. So, definitely, more demand in the market, and as a result, more demand than we forecasted at UPS and then our customers forecasted.\nWe did have some customers that were able to shift volume into the two weeks after Cyber Week through self gifting promotions and even giving promotion dollars back to customers. And we are going to emphasize that initiative with additional retailers to help move some of that demand into the latter week. But, as Myron noted earlier, we did deliver, over 90% of the days were over 30 million packages. So that increased demand. And we will take all these learnings for Cyber Week and apply them to 2018 and just as we\u2019ve been able to really make some significant impact in the other weeks of the peak period.\nDavid Abney\nYes. Just one last thing on Cyber Week. That old saying that rising tides lift all boats that\u2019s the thing that we were facing. If it was 2 or 3 large customers, the control tower -- it\u2019s 20 large customers, the control tower can be very effective in those regards. But, this was not just the large customers, this was throughout the network. And this is something that was in our network, but it was in the other networks throughout the country too. So that is why we\u2019ve got to really take a look at for Cyber Week. One of the things is we\u2019ve added a lot of additional capacity this year that has been covered and much more than in 2017, and we\u2019ve added more technology. So, I know that we\u2019ve been in much better shape from that regard. But, we\u2019re going to take a good look at the control tower and what we need to do around Cyber Week and we\u2019ll be talking about that further in the year.\nScott Childress\nWe\u2019re going to take an online question; this comes from Jack Atkins of Stephens. Do the benefits of the Tax and Jobs Act to the economy, combined with improve trade lead you to believe that you should be positioned to exceed your long-term earnings per share targets?\nDavid Abney\nOkay. This is David. I\u2019ll take the first part of the question and I\u2019ll hand it over to Rich. First, we want to applaud the President and Congress for passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We really believe that it\u2019s going to stimulate the economy and create jobs, and those jobs are going to create more shipments, which creates more jobs and more opportunities for UPS. It certainly makes the American companies more competitive. And we\u2019re also encouraged about the trade. Trade last year did exceed the percent growth of GDP. And at the same time that we are encouraged, we\u2019re a little cautious too. We have matter [ph] that is being negotiated now and we certainly hope and expect that it will be modernized, but it will stay in place. And we hope that other trade agreements, Brexit and those things that they have a pretty smooth conclusion, so that they will continue to be a boost of trade and not the opposite. So that being said, I\u2019ll turn it over to Richard, Company specific.\nRichard Peretz\nSure. So, Jack, first, we put out guidance, it\u2019s somewhat around 20% EPS growth, and we also told you that between $0.80 and $0.85 of that is for the net benefit of tax, which in essence tells you that somewhere around a third of it is underlying business. That\u2019s even with a hit for the discount rate that we had called out. So, if you think about it, we are already seeing that economic activity, our guidance on the revenue numbers of all the segments are at the higher end of our range that we laid out last year. And so, we do believe that the tax reform is creating economic growth. We also believe that we\u2019re participating in that. Unfortunately some of that masked because of both the discount rates and the investments we are making. But at the end of the day, we are seeing a pretty good growth rate, even taking the headwinds that we mentioned.\nScott Childress\nWe are going to take another online question. We\u2019ve got a number of questions coming in about the competitive landscape in Europe and our ability to continue to win share in that market?\nJim Barber\nOkay, Scott. This is Jim, by the way. I think that we get this question quite often. Frankly, it\u2019s about the TNT situation and the cyber attack. And again, I keep reiterating this as long as I\u2019m around it. I don\u2019t know wish that on any one, any competitor or any business in this world. It did happen, it created opportunity for us. If I look at the last couple of years, I just would also like, though to reflect on the fact that we were building capabilities in Europe and European networks since we announced the $2 billion acquisition. Rich talked a minute ago about, at the end of this year, we\u2019ll be 75% of the way through; that\u2019s a capacity play. We also have launched international dangerous goods, these dangerous goods in the region to complement that. And at the same time, we continue to expand our transporter network to basically have 80 plus percent of that, knock wood, touch in two days every buyer and seller on the continent.\nSo, we have invested, in my mind, nicely, irrespective of the competitive landscape. You have to pay attention to it. Very specifically, when the cyber attack did hit, we saw more customers coming to us, there is no question about that. But, I also would tell you that if I compare the fourth quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of last year, we continue to grow. So, there was a spike, but -- and then, the last thing I would tell you is, it\u2019s our job to keep those customers. And quite frankly, from what we see on our side, those -- the vast majority of those customers are staying with UPS because when they come in and start to feel the benefits of the network, they choose to stay with us. So, hopefully, we\u2019ll get into 2018 and beyond and prove that the cyber was the one-time deal for everyone, quite frankly in the market, and we just go compete and take the UPS brand to the market in Europe."]], ["I guess, I would ask why not target 4% to 5% pricing, just to pick a number, something significantly higher than what you are targeting; take a little as volume growth. ", ["So, first of all, there is a tremendous opportunity in the market right now with the growth in the market and also the ability to grow with that market. And we continuously monitor and analyze the supply and demand, and work the price to the value of our network and the portfolio of services that we have. And then, we also surgically ensure that we\u2019re pricing to our cost to serve. And I think some great examples of that is what we\u2019ve done with dimensional weight last year and what we\u2019re doing wit it this year, what we\u2019re doing with additional handling, with the peak surcharge, with our cell by cell GRI assessments. They\u2019re all kind of great examples of that. So yes, so, we\u2019re continuing to monitor the market and analyze that and make sure that we\u2019re pricing our services for the value that we\u2019re providing and certainly returning that back to the shareowners.\nWith that, I\u2019ll give it over to Richard.\nRichard Peretz\nScott. In addition to what Alan said, if you go back to few years, our yields on a per package basis was 0.5%, 1%. So, we have taken a much more thorough look and continue to look at the yield side. But to the other side of it is also the total profit growth and how we\u2019re creating value. Because in total, as we grow profits, if we\u2019re bringing back 20 to 20 -- or 23% to 28% return on invested capital, we know we\u2019re creating more value for the shareholders. So, there is tremendous amount of effort, not on both the top-line and the bottom-line. We have a plan, and each business unit, it\u2019s very specific. And a few years ago, the same question could have been asked by about the two other business units. And now, you\u2019re seeing the result of really the strategies we\u2019ve put in place for each of those. And so, we have a deliberate strategy in the U.S. We think at the end, the shareholders will be very happy with the return we\u2019re getting. And it\u2019s really about putting all the pieces together, just as we\u2019ve done in the other segments.\nDavid Abney\nAnd just to recap, and both covered it very well. Let\u2019s don\u2019t get confused though, target pricing with a cap on pricing. Because as the opportunity creates itself, obviously, going to the top end of the target pricing or exceeding that as long, as we are providing the value and the market will hold that, we certainly look to that area. A lot about this CapEx increase that we are doing is also about bending the cost curve, reducing our cost, adjusting to this new ecommerce world that is rapidly migrating. So, it\u2019s a combination. We are not looking at pricing on one side and then separate from that we\u2019re looking it CapEx and how we can take cost out. This is an integrated model that we\u2019re constantly looking at all aspects of."]], ["So it looks like the underlying sort of growth is accelerating here as International supply chain are happening, but I want to kind of get some feedback from you guys on the direction of the Domestic margin as you think over the next two or three years. ", ["Yeah. Again, it's a little early, because we are just putting these plans together, David. This is Richard, obviously. But I think the first thing you should think about is that next year with 5.5 million square feet of buildings opening, it will be muted as well next year, but it really is part of a deliberate plan. One of the things is we've been looking at buildings and trying to do this as fast as we can. And we've said all along we were balancing the opening of the buildings with the disruption to the network. And so we have seen that putting about a million square feet in this year and next year it's 5 million square feet. So the velocity is a little different than we originally planned.\nBut at the same time, as we get our plans finalized we'll share that, but I would expect that it would be a little bit muted on the lower end of where we guided for next year. But we're still putting plans together, so it's a little early for me to say exactly where we're going to land."]], ["No, I'm not looking for like an exact number, I'm just trying to think like, I think what's keeping a lot of folks nervous about the stock, quite frankly is, is either a lack of commitment, or a feeling that there is a lack of controllability about where that Domestic margin is going to go over the next kind of 2, 3 years. ", ["So I think the first thing is we're looking at this much longer term. I mean we're investing in order to build out our network, not just for the next year or two but really for the next generation. And that plays into it, and if we can move a little faster, it's always going to be the best thing we can do, because our highest return is going to be, of course, reinvesting in the business.\nAnd not all growth is going to be linear because, look at our revenue line right now, we're having some of the fastest revenue growth that we've had in over five years. And we think that that's healthy and we'll continue to adjust the network for that kind of growth because we historically have not had that kind of growth.\nSo I would tell you that you should be thinking about we're preparing this for the future, we're looking at the return on invested capital, and all of our goals are aligned with making sure that we continue to increase value and bring the proper return, not only for UPS, but for our investors going forward."]], ["And maybe in the context of all of that, any sort of incremental risk or concern regarding access to capacity in December, given the looming ELD mandate on the truckload side? ", ["Thanks, Ben. This is Kate. I'll actually address the question. We've been working extensively with customers tied to the peak planning. And so to address some of the points in your question, definitely, consumer demand being what it is, some of it can be steered to other weeks but others will actually, of course, maintain in the period. So there will be a mix with the surcharge, but customers are looking at things like self-gifting. And if somebody's buying something for themselves at the holidays, if it can take extra time, then they will actually activate that to smooth the volume out of say something like a Cyber Monday. That helps their fulfillment centers. It helps also the level of peak spike that occurs. So that's one of the mechanisms, the surcharge, to help steer some of that controllable aspect of consumer demand while other aspects, of course, are committed times and needing to flow as committed. So that's some of it.\nAnd then the operating plans and the use of Saturday delivery and pickup, as I mentioned previously, are items that are helping to steer where possible, activating our Saturday pickup, which is market-leading. Enables packages to be delivered on Monday from shipped on Saturday. And that's proving to be popular with customers and very positively received. Thank you.\nScott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nWe're going to take an Internet question from Allison Landry. Allison's question is:\nHow much B2C growth did you see during the quarter with brick-and-mortar? And is it outpacing growth from Amazon? What are you expecting? Are you expecting these trends to continue in the upcoming peak season?\nAlan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nHey, this is Alan. I'll take that. Yeah. So as you saw in our results, we had another strong quarter of B2C growth, up high-single digits in U.S. domestic. But I do want to also note that it's up mid-teens in our International business, and we certainly expect this to continue. The customers out there, both in the U.S. and internationally are responding well to the UPS industry-leading e-commerce value stack. And that's broad-based growth. It's really coming from the bricks and clicks, brick-and-mortar retailers, along with the e-commerce pure-plays. And it's also coming broad-based from a customer size perspective in middle-market, small and medium businesses, and also enterprise.\nSome of the solutions out there that are really resonating are our newly created Saturday operations that includes Saturday pickup in addition to Saturday delivery that expedites shipments for Monday delivery. And then, obviously, on My Choice, our UPS lockers, our Marketplace Shipping tools and Access Points.\nAnd the one thing I want to note, this past quarter, we launched our UPS returns manager, which is a free online tool that enables merchants of all sizes to customize their consumer return services and processes, and our consumers get hassle-free return services. And we launched that in the U.S. plus 43 countries around the world. So we're building that e-commerce value stack both in the U.S. and internationally. Thanks for the question."]], ["Midpoint suggests a little bit down in the fourth quarter but, I know you have tax dynamics playing out there but with the peak season surcharges and some of the momentum from a top-line perspective, I guess, I just would have thought it would have been a little bit higher than that. ", ["Sure, this is Richard and I think that to start with, Chris, what you said is right. When you look at the first half of the year, we're right on plan. The U.S. business is adapting well. International continues to, as Jim mentioned, to have good growth, and supply chain is recovering. As we looked, though, at the current data, what we also noticed is although we are seeing some positive trends in many of the different industry types in B2B, we're a little challenged because the number of stores that are closing is having an impact on growth in the B2B. And so the forecast for B2B, if you go back earlier in the year to today, is not quite as strong because of retail sales and also because industrial production forecasts were higher even three months ago to where they are today.\nSo we took that information and we looked at that against also some of the items that we called out that won't repeat in the second half of the year and we put it all together and we just didn't see enough new data that would suggest at this time we should adjust guidance. Obviously, as in the past, if more information comes in and it's appropriate to suggest a change, we would communicate it appropriately. But, at this point, based on \u2013 we're adjusting to how the volume and the customer demand is changing and we feel comfortable with where we're at.\nDavid P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nRichard did a good job explaining the puts and takes for the fourth quarter. And I just want to make it very clear, as Richard and our team knows, we expect to have a very good fourth-quarter from a service standpoint and we expect to have good financial results. And we have been working on that throughout the year. So a lot of confidence there. Okay. Next question, please.\nScott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nWe're going to take an online question. We've got a few questions regarding one of the joint ventures that we're recently forming. So the question is, can you speak about the recent announcement, the joint venture with SF and when do you expect the transaction to close?\nJames Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nSo, this is Jim. I'll pick it up. A couple of things to note here. I start with some comments David made in his opening talk about this term of partnerships. When we announced our emerging market strategy a couple of years ago, we firmly founded pieces of that on expanded partnerships across the globe. This relationship with SF Express in China really does fit firmly into that. If you know much about the company, its headquarters are founded in the same province that we have our Air hub in Southern China in Guangdong. They have been in business since 1993. Arguably, they're the domestic leader in the B2B and B2C space. They combine with our brand and our International export capabilities in China and it was one of those markets that we all have to evaluate and make strategic moves.\nWe're super excited about it. We are waiting for the final regulatory approvals to come through but when it does, we believe it opens up segments of the market that we are better off to partner with SF and the leadership than go it alone and hence the JV announcement and we look forward to the regulatory approval and then talking more about that in the quarters and years to come."]], ["And then, if there is no impact or no change this year, maybe, I know it is early, but can you give a preliminary view on what kind of potential tailwind we could see from currency next year? ", ["Sure. So actually, just to step back for a moment, in 2017, we went to a \u2013 we were, historically, before 2017, used a collar approach and it was a stock market transaction. What we did in 2017 is to do a transition because starting in 2018 we'll go to a dollar cost averaging where we're spreading it over a 36-month period. What that means is the year-over-year comparisons won't have big variations. But what it means for 2017 is that we do have a collar. The increase over the last, probably few weeks, where the dollar has lost between 6% and 8% of the value is inside the collar. So for the hedge currencies, what that means is it's going to be right where we expected it to be, and for the unhedged, you'll have a slight difference in the overall.\nNow, if you recall, we called out during the first quarter, we had about $119 million drag from currency. This quarter, $114 million. Until the quarter closes, and each month closes, I won't know what the drag is and how much it changes because the most recent changes will impact July, and then whatever happens is going into August and September. But because we give you that new schedule in our web schedules, that will allow you to see. And as it comes down, we'll obviously communicate that, but right now, we're sitting at about $117 million this morning. And that's right in the collar range that we had already set out. But with the new program, the most important part is we won't see this year after year starting in 2018. And it's also important to remember when you look at the International business, we have an 18.4% margin even with the drag from currency, so we continue to have industry-leading margins because all the work Jim and his team is doing in growing the business and growing exports."]], ["That was very nice at 6.4%, and we've not seen that type of growth for the past couple of years in Next Day Air because I can remember seeing the shift past couple of years from premium products to Deferred products. ", ["Yes. So, this is Alan. I'll take that. Yes, so as you know, we saw premium Next Day Air revenue grew at over 7% and Deferred grew at about 13.5%. There's a couple of things going on there. First, our customers are really responding and enjoying our continual expansion of the Next Day Air and Next Day Air's early service to more postal codes to anybody else out there in the market. And so our market leadership in Express and premium Next Day Air supports our healthcare, high-tech, and professional services segment customers, and strategies.\nIn fact, now, and for the last few quarters, UPS is the air market volume leader.\nOn the other hand, the Next Day Saver, the UPS Ground, Deferred Air are focused to support our e-commerce and retail customers, and so when you look at our air products and how we have them positioned, along with the integrated portfolio with the ground, we have the industry segments that need that premium service identified and we are making some real gains there. And then we're also addressing the opportunity for the Next Day and Deferred Air opportunities for the e-commerce type of customers. So thanks for the question."]], ["So, I had a quick one just on how changes in lease accounting rules will impact the P&L and then on the CapEx just a follow-up, the current increase in investment, just trying to understand what that assumes for growth in B2C volumes.

So, I'll start with the lease accounting and tell you that we are in the process, it's a 2019 implementation of preparing all of the leases that will have to be put on to the balance sheet according to the new accounting standard.

For example, we're an integrator that owns our aircraft and we own an aircraft within our company. So when you see deposits, for example, we put those into the CapEx early because that's \u2013 we are putting in the deposits before we take ownership. There are other companies around the world that don't always own their planes or they're off balance sheet so they have a different preparation than we would have.\nThat being said, it's a tremendous effort that we are going through and at the appropriate time when it's all put together, but like I said, we have more than a year-and-a-half till we get there. In terms of the capital, if you go back to our investor conference presentations, we did talk about the growth rate and as I mentioned, the last four quarters in the U.S. have grown almost 5% or more, which is above our historical norm on revenue.\nAnd you'll see that we continue to believe that what we're doing from an investment side is helping to support a flexible network ability to do more capacity and it's all part of the smart logistics network that we're creating and so we feel very comfortable with the 7.5 million square feet that we have under construction and the announcement that somewhere between 28 million and 35 million square feet will be completed, that we're building this really for the tremendous opportunity of e-commerce and how that's moving, shopping, from physical stores to online."]], ["I'm not sure if you look at it this way, but just given e-commerce growth is accelerating and really accelerating off a higher base, the key question for me is, whether you think the current run rate of investment is appropriately sized for that growth or just how you think about the relationship between the two.

", ["Hey, Chris. This is Alan. Thanks for that question. Yeah. Look, I mean I think the pricing actions that we discussed on the last call were certainly visible in this quarter's results and we also generated some good volume growth with Next Day Air up 4%, Deferred up over 4%, and ground over 2%.\nThe first quarter, U.S.-based pricing came in at the higher end of our 2% to 3% range. And some of the things we're doing, the annual GRI, we broadened the U.S. Domestic DIM divisor from 166 to the 139. The additional handling, the overmaxes, the new fuel surcharge, it's all being managed very, very tightly and well and we're very, very pleased with those results.\nI'd also just let you know on \u2013 Richard talked about peak and surcharge pricing that ensures pricing is aligned to cost to serve whether it's peak or in other parts of the year, and we've got a significant focus in that area also. And just a little color there on some of the objectives where we're really looking to set the market expectations for pricing to match the supply and demand.\nWe're looking to cover the additional costs that we incur in those periods that lead up to and including peak as well as other periods of time where volume surges. And we're very, very focused on maintaining and improving the margins during peak. And then bottom line, always ensuring that we're protecting the integrity of the network for our customers with a great service that they've grown accustomed to.\nThanks for the question."]], ["So, first thing, I just wanted to clarify, in the press release in the International segment, when you talk about currency-neutral operating profit, does that suggest that currency is hurting first quarter 2017 results and the base is a lot higher or is it that it helped first quarter 2016? ", ["Yeah. Thank you for the question. It's quite a bit to that question. So, Richard, why don't you start the first? And then, Jim, if you follow up, I'd appreciate it.\nRichard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nSo the question around the currency-neutral is there is an accounting standard as how you have to state those. And the accounting standard is that you use the last year because that's a published number. And so, what you'll see there is that's restating this year to last year. So for your models, you probably need to talk with Scott, but you would actually probably do it slightly different than what the accounting standard is.\nBut the most important thing is, is that when you look at the International business, it's really a story of what we've seen the last two years. Jim talked a minute ago about the broad-based growth in Supply Chain and we're seeing the same thing in the International business.\nAnd with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jim to talk about.\nJames Jay Barber - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nI think, Scott, you also wanted to kind of touch on pricing in Forwarding. I would say that there was an event in the first quarter in the Asia market with about 20% of the capacity coming out of Shanghai market when five air carriers were put down with about 50 segments a day. So that actually allowed us and others to actually tighten up and focus on the margin and the pricing a little bit stronger.\nAnd it also saw business move from forwarding into small package and back and forth. So, with respect to in the first quarter and the pricing in flat environment of Forwarding, I would say it was the best for us in about two years.\nOur great margins continue to go way up, the bottom line continues to expand. We'll continue to do that. And we'll talk more, I think, in the upcoming calls about pricing in the small package around peak as well. We talk a lot about that in the Domestic market, but International has a role and responsibility to play there as well and we're evolving and maturing in that segment as well. So we'll talk more about that as we approach peak."]], ["So, I think the Pulse of the Online Shopper reports that EPS puts out are pretty informative, and we've seen recently one of the big-box retailers offered discounts for items online, purchased online that aren't in the store.

And I think, obviously, we had questions \u2013 David had so far \u2013 about some of the investments and other ones we're looking at and how we speed those up.\nThere is a rhythm to this, obviously. We are the world's largest customs broker. That's a big business that it needs to be innovated and blockchain is one of \u2013 along with the likes of artificial intelligence, and obviously, we've got the Trade Facilitation Agreement that now has come across under World Trade Organization.\nSo, yes, it's in there. It's in many pieces of our business, including other parts of Forwarding. We don't want to get too far \u2013 ahead of ours skis here and talk about it today on the call. But I think as it evolves and we put more of it in the market, we'll point to that in the calls and how it's really impacting both customers and the bottom line of business. And I think Rich has a couple comments as well.\nRichard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nYeah. When you think about the potential of a blockchain, we see a tremendous amount not just in the areas Jim talked about, but also even in how customers and suppliers \u2013 our customers who are fulfilling transact. And so we do think there's a lot of potential there.\nAnd that's one of the reasons that David actually created the Advanced Technology and Engineering Group is to make sure we stay in front of the latest in technology, figuring out where the best business uses are. Sometimes there'll be many. We may start with one and then apply it differently across the entire network.\nSo we are watching that very carefully. And between our Advanced Technology Group as well as our Strategic Enterprise Fund, we will find where the best use is, but one of the things we have to make sure is the right and proper controls in the ownership of the data that's there before we can start putting it into the integrity of our systems."]], ["Good morning, everyone, and thanks for getting me on the call here.\nSo, David, I guess following up off the response to that question and something you talked about earlier with a balanced top-line and bottom-line focus. ", ["Okay. Well, I'll start out that question and then we'll go to Richard. But, first, I have to tell you that we look at it a little bit differently than you do. So I appreciate your opinion, but we believe that it needs to be a very balanced approach.\nWe have talked today and Alan shared that we were at the top end of our range that we're looking at the 2% to 3% of increasing our pricing. But he also talked about the surge pricing and what we're going to do there to make sure that our costs are covered, especially during those high points of the year where capacity is tight. So, I don't believe we're putting less emphasis on pricing. I think that we have wrapped up the emphasis on pricing.\nWe have also shared with you that we're going to see positive operating leverage in the U.S. this year. We knew that we were going to have some investment costs at the beginning of the year that would not have as much revenue coming in as it will in the later part of the year.\nBut we really feel the key is we have to be balanced. We have to continue to work on our costs. We want to grow the business. We want to grow it in the right direction and we're putting a lot of businesses in that area, and we're going to make sure that we're pricing right.\nSo, Richard, I may not have given you a lot of wiggle room, but go ahead and follow up on a couple of the things.\nRichard N. Peretz - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nSure. When we look at how we're doing and what we're doing today, we are investing in the network and we're not investing in the network for the next quarter or the next year. It's really about generationally and about the long term.\nThere has been a fundamental shift in how our market has been created for small package. The time period you were talking about, you can go back and you'll see there was a much larger B2B. The number of people buying online was much lower. And so, our market is expanding, but the way people are receiving merchandise is different. And we're preparing this company and our network to make the adjustments for that.\nAnd then the other thing that I don't think we expected to see the last few years was really how slow IP was. Now, we do see IP starting to recover, but we're also balancing that with a lot of brick-and-mortars redoing their model and adjusting.\nSo, it's really about the investment, getting to $800 million to $1 billion in savings and avoidance we called out. And we think over the long term and as we complete the transformation of the network, you'll see that all of the efforts we put in not only bring back the return on invested capital at the highest in the industry, but the margins are appropriate as we have guided at the Investor Conference as well."]], ["And second, on last mile warehousing, as B2C becomes a larger part of your business going forward, do you see the need to shift your operating footprint and your warehousing footprint to be closer to the customer? ", ["So I'll take the first part of the question around the fire and then I'll pass it off to Jim to talk about the distribution question.\nBut Ravi, if you look at what we put out and I think when you see this quarter, we tried to give as much transparency as possible and full visibility to the onetimes, what was happening with fuel as prices change and increase as well as what was going on with the currency.\nBut at the end, you can kind of pretty much figure that the big change in both the weather and the fire combined was about $20 million, and that could be laid out based on the math that we have there. And those were things we weren't (53:32) at the same time, we had another benefit in the tax that kind of offset that.\nBut at the end of the day, those two combined kind of wash out. But the fire wasn't something we expected. The operation has made all the proper repairs. The building is back open, and the businesses continue to run in that facility. But it was something that we did feel like we need to call out.\nDavid P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nAnd I'll take the second part. This is David and not Jim. But on warehousing and the need for it to be closer, I'll give you a couple of things. First is \u2013 and Alan talked about our omnichannel strategy earlier. And we do believe and especially with some of the brick-and-mortar companies, they're looking at how they can compete with large e-commerce companies. And so, working with us on being able to hit the customer the next day or in two days \u2013 and we've had a lot of good discussions and we believe that we are the best answer when it comes to those retail solutions that's out there.\nAnother thing, though, that we're certainly seeing progress is these midsized customers, that they really want to be able to compete with that time in transit. They could never build the warehousing in order to do that. So that has been our focus over the last few months and will continue to be is how we can use our available facilities and give these midsized customers very similar coverage to what the larger companies would have, and that would be based on our small package network, but it's based on Jim's distribution and warehousing network. And we see that as a very good opportunity for us and we're continuing to work with our customers in those areas. So thank you for the questions.\nDavid P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nThank you.\nScott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nOkay. We're going to take another online question. This question comes out \u2013 some news that came out here this morning, late yesterday afternoon about the Defense Department awarding UPS a contract for services. Alan?\nAlan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nYeah. Look, we're certainly excited to have been awarded that shipping contract for the next five years. The contract is for small package global shipping and custom services and covers the U.S. Military and a host of other government agencies. And it will commence in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nWe're actually one of the leading providers to the U.S. government today, and this enables the U.S. government to continue receiving the value they get from those UPS services. And it's also going to provide us with some significant opportunities to grow our business with the U.S. government, while helping them create better efficiencies and value for them and their customers. So we're really excited about that opportunity. Thanks.\nScott Childress - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nWe're going to follow up with another online question about synthetic density and what we're doing to create synthetic density in our business models as we build up these investments.\nDavid P. Abney - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nYeah. We've talked about synthetic density before and how it is important to improve the residential stop density, and we've got quite a few initiatives that we're focusing on there. We've seen some improvements and we think there's a lot of potential. So it is something that we talk to our customers about, especially the large shippers, the large e-commerce, the large brick-and-mortar shippers.\nSo, Alan, do you want to get into a little bit more detail about synthetic density?\nAlan Gershenhorn - United Parcel Service, Inc.\nYeah. I would just start out by saying that when you look at really our whole UPS e-commerce value stack, almost everything we're doing there has a component of creating synthetic density, while at the same time, providing great value to the retailers and the consumers that enjoy those services.\nWe all know about SurePost and SurePost Redirect, and Redirect was up about 10% for the quarter year-over-year, quarter-to-quarter. Some of the other services like UPS Access Point where the shipper from their web portal can direct their consumers to UPS Access Points, both for their convenience or for the retailer to achieve a lower cost, while UPS ends up with a more profitable shipment.\nThey can also \u2013 on 35 million now My Choice users are redirecting a lot of their packages to these access points and then, obviously, our not in ones, when we miss you at home, we're redirecting those to access points. So that's kind of, like I've said before, the Swiss Army knife of getting consumers' deliveries in a profitable way.\nWe're rolling out about 300 lockers in the U.S. We've already got 200 of them out there and they're another way for us to make that synthetic density. And you've heard us talk about SDS, Synchronized Delivery Solutions, where the match is created before the package ever leaves the shipper.\nAnd then last, but not least is returns, which we're going to continue to drive. We've just added Optoro to our industry-leading returns value proposition, and that's going to enable customers to optimize the value for disposition of those returns goods.\nAnd then last, but not least is that the \u2013 one-tenth of a piece per stop on delivery density increases our operating profit by $200 million. So we're extremely focused on continuing to drive this synthetic density."]], ["You mentioned at the early part of the year, it's still a struggle of productivity and it seems that the key metric really is the fleet utilization within that productivity number. ", ["David, good question. This is Matt. I would say we're no better at predicting fleet productivity than we were late [indiscernible] time, to be frank. But when we do have a lot more, right, three levers combined in the two, in the one versus the two and then mix. So we think that we've been very explicit that fleet absorption is going to be the greatest opportunity. The only reason why we're talking about that it will take some time is because it's not going to be a light switch. But we think the combination of our rigorous management of it, some easier comps, quite frankly, as we get through the back half of the year is going to make it accelerate. But I wouldn't necessarily take that at Q1 or Q2 as positive or negative. Just that we feel it will improve throughout the year. We do feel -- I mean, if this guidance holds up, these end markets hold up, everything that we firmly believe in, it implies fleet productivity being positive. It almost have to. So we do we do feel firm on that."]], ["I'm struggling with so many costs in 2019, right, $12 million in the last quarter alone on oil and gas, $8 million now in the fourth quarter, oil and gas hit.

So it's just having to absorb both the natural inflation of the business when you're in a low single-digit environment, but also some of the choices we're making to continue to lean in to making sure we're building out capacity for some of our other initiatives. If we were managing for a quarter, maybe you wouldn't make those investments. We're certainly not or we don't think anybody want us to so it's just a little bit of headwind from those two, but slow growth is the main driver. Jess, I don't know if you want to add any more color.\nJessica Graziano\nYes. I think the only thing I'd add is that there's really two other dynamics that are playing through. One is those comps in the first half for upstream, right? We really -- we saw in 2019 that the rig count in the upstream business really started to decline in the third quarter of '19, right? So we need to comp that through the first half. The other thing is we're going to continue to make the investments that I mentioned, right, continue to build out some of our services business that frankly, come in with lower margins. They're not as asset intensive, so the returns are really good in those lines. But in building those up off of a low base, right, there's going to be some investment that we're going to continue to make in building those businesses out. The other is continuing to invest in cold-starts that also need time to build up and build out and some of the digital capabilities that we're going to continue to grow and lean into in 2020."]], ["At the specialty day, I think we spoke about 32 cold-starts plant for '20, which if we look at the midpoint of the CapEx guidance range, the entirety of $300 million of growth CapEx would be accounted for by specialty. ", ["Yes. So glad you viewed that. I heard that was very widely and broadly enjoyed from the investment community. And Paul and the team did a good job. I would say we've got that number right now, take, for $25 whether it's accelerates, we'll have a lot to do with -- actually, CapEx will be the last part of the decision we are we getting the facilities of people that we need to accelerate it to maybe a goal of above 30, as we did, frankly, in '19, we increased the amount from what we originally thought. So this is no change in the overall strategy. But just to be clear, the number that we're focused on right now is 25 cold-starts planned for '20, and that may lessen that CapEx need more to the $200 million range as the way we're thinking about it right now. That will be prioritized because, as I said in my prepared remarks, this is a differentiator for us. And solving more customers' problems, we think, is a real part of why people do business with United Rentals. So no change in strategy, just numerically might be a little bit less than what you may remember from the specialty day."]], ["A, can you just talk about the decision for CapEx for '19 to come in at the high end of the prior guidance range because if we have CapEx at the low end of the guidance range, time -- you would be 50, 60 basis points stronger and obviously, you folks made those decisions in the field on a case-by-case basis. ", ["Yes. So unfortunately, and we joke about this internally a little bit. I can't cut up a 60-foot boom and create generators and light towers. I will tell you that when we look at the fourth quarter CapEx, which we manage very tightly we had a significant amount, almost 25% of that was just our HVAC assets. So between leaders, temporary power, stuff like that. So that probably would be in the range of -- with the math that said $50 million, $100 million less, if it was just -- if we weren't bringing in assets that where we had some time utilization opportunity. It was more -- the mix of assets that we're bringing from -- for different businesses and to support. As to your question earlier, our specialty growth and some seasonal items as well."]], ["Given the way the rest of the year guidance played out where mix obviously was fairly significant as well as some of the cost obviously to repair and maintain and move some of the equipment out of the softer industrial markets, can you help us a bit -- we're trying to think about 2020 margin sensitivity to mix. ", ["Sure, Dave. This is Matt. So first off, I think one of our opportunities, especially if we know it ahead of time, right? So if we feel comfortable that the work we're going to do throughout this quarter and our planning process for 2020, and the field validation and customer information that we're going gives us a better view. The sooner we can reposition stuff appropriate to where the opportunities are, the better the outcome's going to be. There will be some nuance not just between oil and gas and other markets, some nuance as to markets that bring higher returns than other or a different mix than other. But I think in the balance of a full year planning area, the most important part is getting the fleet in the right area so we can maximize the usage of that fleet and therefore, our fleet efficiency. So that's how we view it. Acknowledging there can be some moves. All that work will be done in detail from the ground up, and then reviewed top-down to get us ready for 2020 guidance in January."]], ["And especially given used equipment sales will be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter, I'm just trying to make sure we don't get off the phone thinking that fleet productivity year-over-year degrades, deteriorates, from what we just saw, at least not materially, because it's sort of what's implied in the guide if we use the revenue midpoint. ", ["Yes. No, I understand the viewpoint and the position there. As always, we'll do the obligatory don't anchor of the midpoint. But to be fair, we give you -- we create the midpoint for you. It really is a number that's going to move compared to where we end up within that pretty tight range that we gave you. So -- and part of that range, you will be very pleased with it. And if we end up in a different part of that range, maybe less pleased. But I would just say it is a way that we talk about the output and not to be predicted. So I get your point though. So thanks for that."]], ["So I just wanted to ask about outside of oil and gas, it seems -- I mean, you guys have a really good insight to what's happening, sort of a finger on the pulse of the construction and other economy. ", ["Yes. Thanks, Rob. So as we're into the planning process, and we'll be doing reviews here and within the next 30 days, in detail at the field level, we'll -- a couple of data sets that we look at. In addition to everything that all of you have access to, our additional information, as we've said before, is our customer confidence index, which remains strong. I referred to that in my prepared remarks. Whereas we have still 60% of our customers survey believe next -- 2020 will be better than 2019. So admittedly, that subset is more large customers. So as we've said before, strategically why we focus on large customers is they're the ones that are going to do better in a slower growth environment. So yes, you could say if you want to jade that at all. But 97% of the customers say it will be flat to better. Only 3% of the customers are looking at their business as 2020 being down, so that's a good indicator for us.\nWe then need to test that with our field representatives, whether it be sales folks or the managers, in what they're seeing in their business in the competitive landscape, in a volume landscape, in a jobs landscape. So all that work will be done throughout Q4, and we'll inform what we guide to for 2020. And the industrial part, I mean, the other part of it I'd say is I think some of the headwinds we have absorbed internally in the first half of the year won't be there next year. So I think we'll be better prepared to position the fleet more accurately. We'll be more externally focused. So I'm looking forward to that after the team did a lot of work internally in the first half of this year and is moving past that."]], ["And you went through this, a similar dynamic in the industrial recession a few years ago where you redeployed fleet out of the oil patch into some of these other markets, and you managed to pull it off. ", ["In the relative scale of our $15 billion of fleet, we're not going to move it. It's still a pretty small number, right? We're not going to move it to any end market that it's enough to overwhelm, right? I guess, we move all of it to one market. Technically, that could be. We're not doing that. We're moving it to the markets where nonres is strong. And to be fair, even close by, downstream's still strong. So just for clarity. We talked about industrial being choppy. They're not all down. Downstream is still a good part of our business. Upstream and midstream are negative. And the rest of them are just kind of a little bit up, a little bit down, leading to a flattish industrial overall end market. But that -- those in markets that we have and the customers that we can serve outside of those verticals is where we're moving that fleet.\nAnd it's not a single enough, large enough number to any one of those verticals or geographies that's just going to create a supply glut in our opinion. I'd say the other difference between -- because I know a lot of people will tie this dialogue of oil and gas to back what happened between '14 and '15, right? When oil and gas was at a peak then, it was a much bigger part of our business. But even for the industry overall, that knock on impact of what happened with oil and gas in '15, of the infrastructure to build -- to help serve the area around it of improved -- or additional hotels, retail, right? Shopping centers, even schools, all that's built out already. That was not part of this oil and gas run the past couple of years. So therefore, you won't have the knock-on effect that you had back then. And that's the way we're viewing this. We're viewing this as a temporary issue that we had to work through, but nowhere near the impact that we had back in '15."]], ["But maybe just a second one was coming back to I think you said your nonres -- or just maybe it was construction in total, up almost 9% in a backdrop where depending on what statistics you're using, I mean, there's not much by way of overall construction spending growth.

We are still on a pipeline that we do work on. But the lean would be more on additional products and services customers versus our overlapping products and services. And the second would be filling out any gaps in distribution and footprint. So by definition, that leans towards specialty. And on top of that, they're good return business. The 3 criteria of cultural, strategic and then financial still needs to be met, and that's a high bar for us. So -- but there's deals out there, and we'll see. If any of them meet those 3 deals, we have a flexibility. Jess and the team have given us the balance sheet and the flexibility that we could still do stuff that's accretive to the business.

All I would say is, we are very thoughtful and confident about the guidance that we gave here and here we are a couple of weeks into the quarter. So, you can extrapolate from that what you think.\nMore importantly, the disruption that we did see, primarily not getting the builds we expected at the end of the quarter in June, we have identified the opportunities to remediate, to repair that.

So that's a good part of our used sales. Pricing held up very strong there. I think the only place where you heard any dampen is surprising at auctions, which is not a channel we utilize, was on some of the large [share]. I don't know what drove that but that didn't impact us whatsoever. We're seeing across the board, that 2.5% that Jess quoted, remember is like-assets to like-asset and we see it as a very robust used sales of end market and we think that points to the demand that we still see in the market place. I think our channel mix gives us an advantage over maybe others in the industry where we\u2019re very focused on retail and that certainly gives us a higher margin achievement."]], ["It\u2019s pretty atypical if you look at the history of URI to have this sort of magnitude declines in your pro forma utilization and still get rates that are at or above the rate of underlying inflation.

Industry discipline has so much improved in this cycle from the last cycle. And I think those are two big factors. And I also think that growing the time -- the time utilization were down because of demand than may be you would see a different issue. We don't feel our time as we've talked about a last year is a result of the demand. We've figured a little of delays and then $1.5 billion of fleet in November from our BlueLine acquisition. That wouldn't be a normal cadence that we would do.\nSo, we think it's a result of the timing of the integration and working that through the system than any kind of demand issue and so they really are interplaying as normal because the time was not caused by lack of demand."]], ["Matt, can you just expand on, what it is that's driving some of the slower than expected integration with BlueLine and I think relative to seeing even the pro forma utilization that's down year-over-year, even if you were tracking kind of behind maybe we could see that perform a little bit better. ", ["Sure, Joe. So, when we think about that 2.2 pro forma reduction, it's about half of it that we had modeled in and we knew what's going to take some time to work some of these fleet through the system. As I said, we wouldn't have brought in $1.5 billion worth of fleet in November in a normal case. So, about half of that was expected, half of it unexpected. And when we think about that unexpected, we did a deep dive on some analysis of where we either needed and couple was dependent on the market, right, so, we did a market-by-market deep dive.\nIn some markets, we weren't getting enough new business in the pipeline. So, we have been addressing that. We load opportunities in our CRM. This is just normal operational blocking and tackling. In some other markets, it was more about sales coverage. We needed to add sales reps, we addressed that. So nothing magical, just normal operational work that we did. And maybe our expectations are this large deal -- largest deal we've done in quite a while of working through this quickly, maybe our expectations were off, I don't know. But either way, the tactics that we're taking through repair are the same that we would have done regardless."]], ["And do some of the actions that you take now and use set down growth CapEx, I mean does that even includes going in and sort of assessing where some of these pockets of underperformance are? ", ["Yes, absolutely. So I put that in the expected portion. So where we did expect that capital that we normally would have put in those markets as they absorb the acquired capital, we put into other markets. Where specialty has gotten more capital throughout the year, they continue to use that well. We've had a couple of geographic regions pick up the pace, and they got a couple of -- a little bit more capital. The cut to the top end of our capital was directly correlated to that other 1% that was unexpected. So if you think about, we just had latent capacity that match that $150 million that we cut off the top, and we just thought it was prudent to use that. But it doesn't change the slope of our growth in the back half of the year, if you're following me just the starting point. We just thought was prudent to not spend the capital on that, let the team use the adornment capital to fill that that demand that we expect in the back half of the year."]], ["I'm just wondering how much more room do you have to pivot CapEx lower if you need to have far out, are you committed because Matt to your point earlier on the call in terms of latent capacity given where utilization was in the quarter, you have to go back a while before we see utilization at these levels in 2Q. ", ["As we\u2019ve talked about before we have a lot of flexibility in our capital spend. We\u2019re very aligned with our partners and that\u2019s what\u2019s allowed us to make this trim relatively easy. It\u2019s not on our calculus right now to go lower than the range that we\u2019re in. We want to reiterate we feel good about the demand environment and the opportunities that are there. So once we absorb the extra 1% that we didn\u2019t expect and then work the rest of the fleet through our system we think this is the right capital allocation for the end market that we\u2019ll be working in for the rest of the year.\nSo is the opportunity there in a different environment? Yes, but I don\u2019t want you to take away that that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed to."]], ["Has that evolved at all as we look at the actual time utilization reported for the quarter, given all of the differences we've seen in terms of the move towards specialty in the business? ", ["Joe, that's an excellent question and thank you for asking it, because the change in the calculus is really the shift for us to fleet profitability and it's less about targeting a particular time utilization number or particular rate number or particular mix number even. But rather going out in the field and again it is much rate as we possibly can utilizing the fleet to the highest level we possibly can in a way that makes sense. And to the point you're making about specialty, continuing to optimize mix that would come through a more profitable fleet, and more profitable fleet that's going to consistently meet the demand of our customers. So, that calculus shift is fleet profitability and really the interplay that's going to come from continuing to optimize that profitable growth and return that we're after."]], ["Could you address, it sounds like you feel pretty comfortable with the back half of the year but the ABI has been a little bit soft, you mentioned some of your customer discussions that sound solid.

When you look at, construction employment numbers, I think highest of all time. You look at other indicators including our Customer Confidence Index and the feedback from our 1,200 locations out in the field, the managers and sales reps that get paid to do this every day, we feel good about the end markets. How much that plays in and where that ends in 2020, we will spend a lot of time in the fall taking a look at and obviously that will influence our guidance. But, we do feel good about the end markets."]], ["But how should we consider the M&A pipeline, given this new target and any material changes as to, you think you're going to slowdown or might there even be expansion in looking internationally, perhaps.

We're in much more of a absorbing leverage mode in the generic business as you could see, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking about that today. But we certainly have a length perspective to see. If the rights deal comes up, we're very, very interested in any kind of specialty acquisition that can meet our threshold, right, very high bar both culturally, strategically and most importantly financially. But we really like to space. And if we can get some new products, or build out of a footprint that we think would be more efficient for us to do it through M&A versus an add back to the organic growth we're showing, I would say that's where our lean would be. Internationally, we're still moving very slow. We have got a great team that's there. We are international. Now with 11 stores, we got the Baker acquisition, they're doing a great job. But we're going to continue to take a watch and learn mode before we go dive deep into the pool. And we'll update folks once we feel that there's a pivot from that position."]], ["So just trying to understand I guess how much bigger does that part of the business grow as we look kind of towards at the balance of the year in 2020? ", ["So, we think first of all, the infrastructure growth isn't so much as there is tailwind all over the end markets growing. It's also our focus on it. So, we started focusing on infrastructure as a vertical and tailor to go-to-market strategy for that, as well as product strategies, because we knew there was just such demand and need for infrastructure improvements throughout the country.\nSo that's paying off and it's a great example of opportunities, where even as end markets may have slower growth, as we have vertically focused our sales teams and our product offerings to end markets where we think our offering benefits more than the competition, we could actually swim upstream in some of these markets and we did that for a little while in infrastructure and that was some tailwinds.\nHow much it ends up? What size of our business is it? Really the focus, it's more of we have the core products like trench, like fluid solutions to go along with our genuine products to really support that customer base."]], ["Just trying to understand if we will make our own assumptions about rate, obviously, the time you sound like something as you absorb the fleet, we get into the seasonally stronger periods. ", ["So, obviously, two of the big drivers in mix are rate and time. But I mean, I am sorry not just the mix in fleet productivity. But when you think about that mix component, sometimes it's just additive but there are other times where it's actually influencing the other metrics. For example, if we grow specialty products more than we expected, that's going to be a drag on the time but we will get a positive offset to it on mix. So it's just hard of us to forecast that's why we don't. These are all outputs. I would say that as Jess said in her opening comments, we're off to a strong start of the year. We're on target and for everything that's embedded within our guidance.\nAnd if you want to go on the margins of time a little bit whereas rate a little bit better, that's fair. But how that plays out into mix is really going to depend on what assets we end up growing with, with the remainder of our capital guide for the rest of the year and what the customers need and how that changes. So I'm not trying to be avoided just truly, those are all outputs from what we expect. The good news is we expect labor productivity to be strong, because the demand is strong. And that's the correlation I draw. When we look at the data that not necessarily everybody sees anymore, we've seen 31 consecutive months of positive balance of supply and demand. That\u2019s with the overall market expectations that we have of strong end markets, we think will result in strong performance as we've guided."]], ["But if we just assume for a second, it was still a decent year, it does appear one of the challenging if you applied most the cash flow next year to deleveraging, and you grow the EBITDA a little bit. ", ["It's a great question, and a conversation that's very topical for us as a management team and also with our board. We also -- let me say here that just in all the conversations that we also have with investors, we appreciate and we consider the feedback that we get from investors as well. As you noted, we expect we're going to finish 2019 at 2.5 times and we feel really good about that, considering the focus this year is going to include absorbing all that acquisition activity. And as we look beyond that 2020 and to your point, we can debate the macro. But as we look beyond that right now, it's really premature for us to make a call on how that could change our capital allocation strategy specifically.\nBetween now and then though, we will have a formal conversation with our Board as part of our annual review of capital allocation. And while there's no news to share right now, of course, obviously, if something happens, we'll share it. What I will say even though it's not new news it's good news. The balance sheet right now is in a really good place. Our debt maturity schedule pushed out significantly. We're generating meaningful cash flow. So the focus is going to continue to think about our capital allocation strategy that's going to be both balanced and dynamic for us going forward."]], ["I had a question just on specialty and it is, I guess, using Baker as a platform, can you talk a bit about how your operational improvement, your toolkits, all the things you do to make businesses better have you have gone at Baker? ", ["Sure, Rob. This is Matt. So, in the scheme of things, it's still early. But I will say in the past 7 to 8 months, there has been a lot of work done and it's really not just Baker that the fluid solutions team is dealing, they're dealing with Thompson as well. So, what they're really working on is the consolidation of offering, not necessarily even in stores, but the consolidation of offering to become a true fluid solutions provider. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, Thompson's added to that with some expertise in sewer bypass and wellpoint dewatering.\nSo, there I'd say the biggest change that we are seeing is the ability to enhance the go-to-market strategy. So, we think that's going to be received very well by the end markets. As far as the tactical integration pieces, the team has been ahead of that and as I've said most of that's underway. Now, it's the go-to-market strategy. How do we get to customers to understand this new? And in many ways, unique provider in that space is really the strategic reason of why we did these deals and the opportunity ahead. So, we feel good about it. It's on target, but we think there's a lot more room in the customer facing side to change the game."]], ["I think if we go back overtime, you've normally spent at least 50% of the full year CapEx usually closer to 60% in the first half of the year, which would suggest something like a $1 billion in 2Q. ", ["Sure, Joe. So to be clear, the Q1 CapEx was a shade lighter than what you see standard, but that was really planned and it was because of the BlueLine acquisition. So as you can imagine, with working that extra capacity, which was very heavily aerial waited, we didn't buy as much aerial in Q1 as we may have in past years because we have the extra capacity. So, that's just smart fleet management. You're numbering Q2 is not far off the pace and whether we go above or below that number, it will be directly correlated to how fast we move that extra fleet through the network.\nBut overall, we have no changes to the full year CapEx guidance. And within that range that we've given in CapEx this year, you could think about the faster we move the BlueLine fleet through, right. Then we'll be on the higher end of the range, and the slower we move it through it and be on the lower end of the range. So, it's really going to be responsive. We think that's how we always look at CapEx and no change to the full year plan.\nJoe O\u2019Dea\nAnd so, the toggle there is really more around replacement spend and growth spend than presumably is still kind of in line with initial expectations?\nMatt Flannery\nYes, that's fair. We're definitely in line with initial expectation. Nothing's changed from that perspective. The end markets are still there for the opportunities that. And frankly, as specialty continues to show really strong growth, if there is extra capacity, that doesn't mean that they won't try to take more of the new CapEx because they have been very effective at turning into growth and profitability.\nJoe O\u2019Dea\nPerfect. And then just moving on to BlueLine and Baker, two quick questions. One, if you could just talk about the cost synergy kind of target for 2019, and how much of that was achieved in the first quarter? And two, if you could talk about BlueLine rate harmonization, obviously the timing of acquiring that maybe shifts a little bit of the opportunity set more into kind of 2Q 3Q'19 for some of that harmonization, but just to understand, kind of what that looks like?\nJessica Graziano\nIt's Jess. So, what we have realized in synergies in the first quarter is about $16 million, total, between BlueLine and Baker together, and when we look at it on sort of full year '19 we're looking at something like $45 million incremental total."]], ["So, Matt, I think you commented that you're starting to see, there were some projects that may have gotten pushed due to weather here in the first quarter that are you don't know were kind of restarting in the second quarter.

But then most every macro data point supports that feeling and even within the ABIs that was released I think it was even noted in the report that they believe that it was due to weather. I mean February was a tough weather month for us and for the industry and for job starts.\nSo we're not surprised by that, but also what came out this morning is the ABC's construction backlog indicator, which was up 8% month-over-month. So in balance we say all the macro indicators are positive even in spite of the ABI number that just came out. So we feel really good about it. Our customers feel good about it. And as we've said before, we think we have good strong visibility 12 months out and that's because of our connection to the end markets and to our customers.\nAnd I don't see anything that points to a concern within that visibility that we feel we already have. So I get the point about ABI that one dataset, we'll see where that ends up in the oncoming months, when the February weather hangover goes away, but we still feel good about the end market."]], ["And then, if you could just talk about your bid pipeline a little bit, particularly in terms of large projects, it seems like maybe following up on Seth's question there, there should be some larger industrial projects that are taking shape at the moment and I know in the past you've also had some chunky CapEx put out there for specific airport projects.

It looks robust, our national account team and our strategic account teams, which are really the large or half of our account profile, backlogs are strong, and they're the ones that are going to be working on the major projects. LNG is still strong. There's still a lot of infrastructure work, major capital projects remain robust and and it's coast to coast.\nI mean there is strength throughout our network and then when you even think about some of the midstream work that needs to get done to help move some of the energy, is really an opportunity for us and we're very well positioned with the contractors that are going to be doing that large work through our scale and through our broad foot print."]], ["I mean, there was -- it's also just in the context of some fairly sizable percentage growth and not a huge driver for URI on the whole, but the ancillary was up quite a bit as in percentage terms.

There's two things going on there. One is that with the acquisitions, we've now modified processes, we've updated technologies, in bringing those businesses in, they're now using that same discipline that we've developed around delivery recovery being obviously an important part of our overall revenues. So that's part of it. The other part of it is that the team broadly continues to be really focused on making sure to have delivery recovery as appropriate across our sales. So it's -- it's good discipline and it's bringing in those two businesses that's driving growth in that line."]], ["I'm wondering if you can talk about -- I'm wondering if you can talk about the Total Control rollout on the acquired businesses and BlueLine, what's the timing, as we look at Total Control now, it's a quarter of your business, 5, 6 years ago was half that, as we continue the new migration toward more customers using Total Control. ", ["Sure. Jerry. This is Matt. I'd say that the -- most importantly the team responded quickly to those customers that Baker was doing business with that were already on Total Control. So the first step was to make sure that we got those assets integrated in and that's some work and I want to get into the details, a part of that work actually has to happen on the customers' end as well, because they build processes through to their vendors, so they had the more fad over.\nAnd then in BlueLine deal, you had a little bit of as well more influenced by Baker than BlueLine, but certainly an opportunity for us to continue to be a full provider to those Total Control customers and I wouldn't say there were any material changes especially when you look at the pro forma growth.\nBut what I would say is broadly regardless of integrations and acquisitions, we continue to get further adoption and usage of Total Control as a tool to help our customers solve productivity issues and that's always what it's been built on and as we put it along our footprint and get more and more of our employees and therefore customers educated on the opportunity, that's how we've driven that growth in Total Control."]], ["And Matt, could you comment on part of the question related to the margin opportunity sets where obviously you're getting benefits of digital transactions and also better customer stickiness as the Total Control part of your business grows. ", ["Yes, neither one of the digital channels or any kind of automation is really done as from a cost to margin perspective, it's really done for meeting the customer where they are, the customers that want to interact with us in that way, we're going to support that and that's why we're building the digital platforms that we are, so we don't see this as huge margin accretion opportunity as much as the other half of your point which is accurate is the stickiness, right.\nAnd we've got to -- we've got to transact with customers in the way they will process this and comfort in transacting and that's more of why you'll see this us do that. What it does give us the opportunity to do is maybe reach some broader customers that we weren't reaching before. This technology gives you a wider net to cast. So I'd say it's more from that perspective than a cost to margin translation."]], ["And then your used pricing, you mentioned that retail was up 5% in the quarter, which is really good performance compared to what we are seeing for the industry overall in that auction results. ", ["Sure, this is something that we've been very proud of and we've worked hard on to build over multiple years. So this isn't a new thing for us. It's that our sales folks were involved in retailing equipment. We have a firm belief that we want to solve all of our customers' problems and just because we're rental company the customer wants to buy a piece of equipment, we've got good quality, well-maintained used equipment to sell to them and we use the retail channel to do that and I think that is the single-digit biggest differentiation between our margins and those that don't do that, but even within the auction results, you see, that it was a little bit of a drag. When you look at the aerial products reaches, they were still pretty strong. So I don't see Tier 4 as the big mover here. I see this is strictly as our channel and the products we sell giving us a good opportunity to keep margins strong and pricing strong."]], ["So I just want to tie a couple data points together from the call, so I mean it sounds like you guys are seeing -- you saw some push out of activity from 1Q in 2Q, that impacted your utilization and also it sounds like that you may be able to catch up CapEx kind of -- like your seasonally normal CapEx schedule. ", ["Chad, this is Matt. I just want to correct one thing in case we misspoke or you misheard. The slower time utilization in Q1 was primarily due to -- we did the second biggest acquisition in our history in November, which was going into the seasonal down curve, right, of demand. Not macro activity, not anything like that, just working that fleet through and all the other integration processes that are normal for us, and if we could have bought that fleet in April, we wouldn't be -- you wouldn't even see it, but the truth, we had the opportunity to buy in November, by the way, we do that all over again.\nWe're very pleased with the BlueLine deal, that's what we did -- the two things that you referred to, dampen time utilization, which we expected in Q1 and we'll see that play out through the first half of the year and a tick down, maybe $20 million, $25 million less capital spend than we would have had we not done that deal. I just don't want anybody misunderstand and think that we were -- we are blaming that activity, we think the demand is robust and we'll just work that through the system.\nSo I just wanted to correct that. And then as we think about fleet productivity, as I said in the earlier point, I think it was Ross who might have asked the question earlier, or David, the fleet productivity metrics and output. So not anymore than we could forecast rate or time which are the two biggest inputs to fleet productivity will we be able to have the ability to forward forecast that metric, but we do think that demand environment's and what's embedded within our guidance will net us positive operating metrics and we'll report them accurately as we get through the quarters."]], ["How should I think about \u2013 and again this is obviously conjecture looking out a year, but for what it\u2019s worth some of the construction spend forecast that you put in your slide show 2020 is a slower growth year for U.S. ", ["So obviously we haven\u2019t locked in on a plan for 2020, so I don\u2019t want to speculate on this call.

There\u2019s nobody else that could own these businesses that we buy that has that opportunity, that muscle to flex and I think it\u2019s been a big secret to our success and something that we\u2019re really focused on. It starts with retention of the employees and retention of the capacity that you acquired as well and those are our two biggest focuses in the first days, not even weeks, days of integration. How do we make sure we maintain the relationships, the capacity that we bought and leverage it into growth?

Anything in the specialty space is something we\u2019d be more focused on. But it has to still meet the three strategic levers that we\u2019ve always talked about, the three points of entry. And I would say that the financial bar has to be higher right now. We\u2019ve got a lot on our plate. We\u2019re doing a great job absorbing it, but we still have opportunity to grow off this new platform. So that raises the bar a little bit on M&A as far as what has to be done.

So he was always driving us forward. But I think the company that we created and the trajectory of the strategy has a momentum to carry us forward. We are constantly looking at new opportunities.

", ["Sure, Jerry. So first off, the dollar on a pro forma basis, which is probably the more appropriate way to look at it, was up 30 bips. The 80 bips was dragged down obviously by some of the lower dollar utilization assets from Baker and other acquisitions; by the way, high return assets as well, long-lived assets. So if anybody thinks that that balance was very \u2013 what\u2019s the right word, it was an important one for us in making decision on that acquisition. Also, it\u2019s additional products and service for our customers. But to answer your question more directly, we feel that this fleet productivity measure is just going to be an accurate filter to look at the business through. We get that folks are going to need to be recalibrated. That is intentional, because we do need to be recalibrated. The specialty mix and that continuing growing specialty mix and evolution of our offerings has changed our company. It\u2019s made us more resilient. It\u2019s made us more diverse and we feel very strongly, it\u2019s made us more profitable. That\u2019s why we\u2019re able to report record returns.

I\u2019d just like to add one thing. We know that as folks are calibrating themselves to the new metric, there\u2019s obviously the math behind how fleet productivity comes together. What we will do after the call is we\u2019ll actually add a cheat sheet to our investor presentation that walks through the math behind how we used to reconcile OER in total rental revenue and how the new bridge to rental revenue will look like using fleet productivity as a component of OER. So everybody can look for that cheat sheet to be up very soon after this call is over."]], ["And realizing that you don't guide on rate, I'm not looking for that but if you reading the tea leaves correctly on your end markets over the next 12 to 18 months like what sort of steady state rate environment you think we're in or are we in plus 1% to 2% or are we in flat, are we in declining? ", ["Sure, Ross. Thanks. So I'll take a couple of pieces of the question then Mike or Jess can add-on. But, when we think about rates, first of all, we don't -- we see this as a good rate environment. So positive sequentials throughout each month in the quarter is certainly extrapolated in our brain into positive rate environment. We guess that the pro forms or the year-over-the year -- on the year-over-year numbers whether pro forma as reported has some tough comps specifically in Q2 and Q3. So we see that that will moderate when we get into Q4.\nFor example, if you lay last year's sequential rate improvement over this year's actual achieved for the first three quarters which we've been challenged that in itself may even be conservative. But for modeling purposes think about that last year's achievement would bring us a 2.1% rate for Q4. That would bring us into 1% carry over into 2019 and what we think as you've heard will be a robust demand environment. So to answer the latter part of your question we certainly do think that this is a rate accretive opportunity not dilutive. So that answers that.\nAs far as the sequentials, no doubt August probably came in a little bit lighter than we thought. The reason we stopped giving guidance is because there are so many thousands of variables and inputs that go into this, that it changes. The good news is that's not an indicator of profitability, it's great directionally. If we had seen negative sequentials that would be a concern for us. But when we get to translate this rate experience into record EBITDA margin as Mike mentioned and high returns we feel very good about the end market."]], ["But do you have in mind like a threshold on that that EBITDA that you might feel like you stepped back in the market or maybe it's like a year and you're working on the integration and thinking about it or longer. ", ["It's a great position to be in as you pointed out. We do carry a lot of free cash flow. The way we framed it. We've said between 2.5 and 3.5 depending where you are in the cycle. We only finished out this year. You can do the math and see what we're going to finish out. And then, as we go into next year we're going to be very comfortably in that range. With regard to where the share prices -- the share price, we've been consistent not looking at that as we've applied our acquisition of the share repurchase program. It could have changed, it could, but right now I think it's going to be continue at a pace we've been doing. And if we change, we obviously will come out and tell you otherwise. But we don't look at that ups and downs as something that we need to have a knee jerk reaction to do something. But to your point, you have to stop think about it."]], ["And then you may not want to answer this question I understand but does the acquisition of BlueLine mean that you don't need to spend on growth CapEx in a healthy environment next year? ", ["Yes. I would think with everything you've heard us say about the demand environment, it would not be a good assumption to think that we're not going to put capital into the business. We feel very good about it. One of the reasons why we feel comfortable acquiring the company and even if you look at our pro forma not just our acquired growth this year, but our pro forma growth this year of 10.9% Q3 rent revenue I think that proves out where our focus is and how we think this larger footprint can only help us grow all about capacity Rob. The tech drivers, branch network and sales reps will bring onboard -- that give us more [indiscernible].\nJessica Graziano\nAnd Rob just mentioned that -- as I know we talked about we're going to continue to be very disciplined in our approach to CapEx, right, so as we think about the planning process for 2019 and we decide where we think the year will go. As a management team we're talking constantly about whether or not that's the right level of CapEx for the business. And then, we are not afraid to flex up or down depending on what the business needs are."]], ["First question is just on kind of the margin path you're on, on EBITDA and trying to think about as we head into next year some of the moving pieces around deal synergies that should contribute I think ancillary that's been high this year and a bit of a margin dilutive effect there. ", ["Hi, Joe. Yes. So we -- as you think about the flow through for next year. Yes, I think it's reasonable to think about the core business will perform at or kind of give or take a little better a little worse than where it is currently. We talked about a flow through of something in the neighborhood of 60% being reasonable for the core business. And that's not going to change. What will change is the impact that we'll feel from a full year of the Baker acquisition. And then, obviously, the impact that BlueLine will have on us in 2019 as well.\nAnd so, well obviously, we're going to continue to drive benefit through both of those acquisitions. There will be a dilutive effect at least in the short-term on the flow through for next year coming largely from those two deals. Now that's going to be offset in part by the synergies that we've realized from them in 2019. But again, there may be a bit of a drag."]], ["And then just one on kind of the CapEx timing where 2Q and 3Q a little heavier CapEx than what you might normally do, I think in response to just like the demand environment. ", ["Sure. No, we don't connect it at all. I mean when you have a rate pressure because of too much demanded, the gap is in whether you get 10 bps, 20 bps, or even 30 bps is positive is that you go negative. So that's why we're not concerned about that. And when we look at the markets overall whether you look by product category or you look by geography we're still seeing in every one of the reasons that steady improvement throughout the quarter on a year-over-year basis which is really what we focus on as a rate indicator. There's just too much noise in the input to individual months of sequential. And you're absolutely right, the CapEx was there to supply demand and as we said we think that demand turned into -- to profitable growth."]], ["Just getting back to a little bit of the why on some of the rate trends here because back in April on this call we were talking about 2.5% to 3% rate growth being reasonable for the year with potential for better. ", ["Yes. As I said earlier, rates were about where we expected. We see 10 or 20 bps as negligible as long as you're getting the robust real life time utilization. The margins that you need and the profitability you need. And admittedly this year was a much smoother than last year and that's part of the competition you see. If you recall last year and I think we even have it in the deck yet we are having on Slide 37. We really dug a hole in Q1. And then, we had to aggressively backfill that hole and you saw really low numbers in Q1 and higher sequentials in 2 and 3. This year was a much smoother curve. If you actually -- ironically January through September of last year and January through September of this year on an actual improvement basis stand right on top of each other. So we still see this as a good rate environment and think '19 will be similar."]], ["Can you give us some insight on the mix of businesses to ration of rentals things that you're eyeing up already that can help us all level set how we think about the implications on time you rate and so forth just because few people are focused on rate new. ", ["Sure, Dave. This is Matt. So the customer profile continues to look similar, I think where there is some movement and I referred to it in the last answer is, as we continue to grow our percentage of specialty business not all that improvement in profitability that we get from specialty shows up in the rate metric I pointed to the $25 million a positive mix improvement in Q3 as an example.\nBut also in time, specialty products are actually diluted or time utilization and we've been offsetting that headwind for years and we'll continue to do so. But it is by far a great business decision because of the profitability that it brings with it.\nAs far as the striations of customers really we're getting growth and expect in 2019 broadly throughout our strategic accounts or national accounts and our local customers. And projects not too dissimilar from what we've seen. And when you think about our day, week, month mix very similar to what we've experienced. So not a lot of movement there. The biggest movement would be in the mix of our fleet dynamics."]], ["Just so again level set of specialties and we continue to be a focus to grow faster than Gen Rent that's a drag on this historical metrics that obviously the stock cares a great deal about. ", ["So we've talk about the inputs that make it hard to forecast rate. It is exacerbated in specialty because you can price different service offerings in different ways whether it includes but doesn't include bulk and what kind how much is solution base versus asset base. It is actually really hard for us to predict. And we just respond to the customers need, price it appropriately, we don't really take that into account. Not that we don't pay attention to the rate and the year-over-year rate in specialty is positive as well and I wouldn't want to call that a drag. I just don't think all the value of a category is what I'm saying that it's not a drag overall in the year. It's not really a drag on rate, Baker will drag us a little bit. But that's okay, we'll get pro forma numbers and call that out. But I think overall, I wouldn't call it a huge variable as much as I would not fully appreciate the ancillary items and the mix positives that comes with specialty.\nMike Kneeland\nDavid, the way I would -- Matt is exactly right. I think this is actually a great topic that we can have a discussion and point out at our Investor Day because we are changing the company. We've talked over the years. We're leveraging our customer and we're bringing that you know the specialty businesses into our customer base and we're growing it and the results are there and the returns are there to talk about.

There is a way for us to maybe help everybody through how the impacts of all these acquisitions, different product offerings, different customer base broader customer base. I think we've got and will Mike or Jess maybe we can do this at Investor Day try to bring this all together and help everybody else see what it is that has changed and what should we be focused on. And then, therefore, you guys should be focused on. I think there's an opportunity there. But as far as for us what this really does is we think just makes us a bigger more important partner to the customers that we serve. By being a broader solution for that.\nAnd that's as well as profitable growth which is why we do them."]], ["I guess just thinking about Europe early days there I know but as you look ahead on Europe, do you think it will be more of a specialty focused region or do you see kind of over time there being a Gen Rent presence there.

It would be premature to say anything else above and beyond that as far as how we would think about it. We do see the opportunity for Baker in Europe to continue to grow at very nice returns and that's where our main focus will be. But clearly, it's -- we're probably looking at sometime in the first quarter towards the mid to tailwind the first quarter, at least the first half of the year beginning to fully integrated with our operating system. So again, it's too early to tell, but we're still focused really in North America, still the biggest market for us.\nMatt Flannery\nI would just add Steven that we are encouraged by the level of talent we did acquire there and how we can leverage that to learn faster than we would have without is probably the opportunity.\nJessica Graziano\nExcellent. And then, thinking about specialty cold starts for next year. Obviously a bigger amount this year than what we thought going in. Thus bringing in BlueLine change the need to have cold starts and instead you just add on the capabilities for specialty to the BlueLine real estate.\nMatt Flannery\nWe'll make that decision. We haven't really decided on it regardless of where house it and how we resource it from the real estate perspective. We are planning on about another 25 cold starts next year in specialty and it going to bring out a great opportunity that we've utilized in past integrations. Sometimes we get to use some of the real estate that we get from an acquisition because they have extra capacity and sometimes we just have to go out and find real estate, but we don't think either way real estate will be an inhibitor force."]], ["And my follow-up on utilization Matt, you spoke about the storm comps, can you just talk about how that continues into October, so you folks had delivered fleet the third quarter which impacted utilization, I think a bit. ", ["Yes, sure. So when we look at our pro forma which is how we always look at these metrics whether it's rate or time we were 0.4 positive in July, 0.2 in August and then you saw 0.7 negative in September. That's when we had the huge ramp up last year because due to Hurricane Harvey and to a lesser degree a little bit on Irma. We take that at about 50 bps of those 70 bps. We think that will continue in October just because of the comp issue. And then, it will start to moderate throughout November and be gone by the end of the fourth quarter. So as we go through Q4, we think that that comp compare issue will erode and will be back to par let's say by the end of the quarter."]], ["But can you \u2013 if we kept this sort of flat you kind of model from here for a while and you're growing the CapEx, say, similar next year as this year how should we think about rate in that dynamic?\nI mean you can't think about rate in isolation, just as accelerating/decelerating, it's the other two variables that impact it. ", ["Yeah. David, maybe I'll lead off here on this one. Always very difficult to say what the rate is going to be. And so I won't address the 3% specific number. What I will say is that, we believe that the demand environment is robust and will continue to be so for some time to come. And as long as you're not overwhelming the rate, the demand with excess fleet, then you should be able to continue to move rates higher. For us it's less about hitting a specific great number like 3% and more about are we delivering a rate progression that allows us to be efficient and prudent in how we add capital to the business? And that translates into profit and margin and return performance that's attractive, right. That's really how we are thinking about it.\nAnd so the rate environment we think will allow for that to continue. We have nice margin improvement and profit improvement in the quarter. We expect nice robust margin improvement and profit improvement for the full year. And we think that will carry over into nice return performance not only this year but next year.

", ["Yes just so Ross just a quick comment and I think Matt will join in as well. Yes. Some of them are 'out of our control' in the sense that we can't control where fuel prices go for example we can't control how we recover fuel charges from the customers who use the fuel. So that's something that we are always looking out very carefully to make sure that if our costs are going up we pass them along. We think that's a reasonable expectation and so the customers usually don't get too much. The freight cost that do get passed along to us when we use outside freight it's hard to fight too much against that but that said we do have the ability to use our own internal delivery capabilities and leverage that more effectively when those costs are going up.\nSo that's what we're doing to try and address that particular cost item. And labor costs right our labor challenge has been about over time more so than wage inflation wage inflation has not ticked up significantly for us but our use of overtime is something that we have control over. And so being prudent about when we use overtime and how do we arrange our drivers and our texts to use them as productively as possible and cut down on the need for overtime is something that we could do here within the walls of United Rental.\nSo those are the things that we're doing to address those cost items. And I think we've had some success here as we've gone through the first half and come out of it having we positioned ourselves so that our expectation in the back half is that our costs are going to look more like what they\u2019ve look like in prior years.\nMatthew Flannery\nRoss, Bill, touched on the key components. Just to put it from an operational perspective and from our point of view what we've done to repair, is when you think about the Q1 and some spill over into April on using third-party services for delivery, third party services for repairs, specifically major repair, it's our slow time of the season. And if I'll be candid, I think our team overused those third-party resources and they came with a large inflationary cost this year. That's what we needed to mitigate.\nWe've in-sourced a lot of this work here in May and June and we've seen the positive results of doing that where are our costs look more in line with previous years as a percentage of either transactions or revenue, which ever you choose, do and that's what gives us confidence that we\u2019ve mitigated it, but it also adds capacity. So that in-sourcing has additional value longer term for growth.\nOur team got excited to get ready for the ramp up to the year and wanted to get the fleet up and moving as quickly as they could and we have to stop the outsourcing. Inflation just prohibit it from being a profitable way to stuff done."]], ["I mean, fleet on OEC is growing 6% to 7% annually at your current annual run rate, net CapEx of like $1.3 billion.\nSo you don't really have to grow CapEx in future years in absolute dollars to support 6% to 7% volume growth, just kind of like what you're growing out right now. ", ["Yeah. What I'd say, Ross, is that we certainly will make our decision about how much CapEx to spend based on, not only the external environment that we're seeing, but also on the needs of the fleet for refresh. Right? The used equipment sales picture. And that CapEx decision will have an impact on exactly where we end up in free cash flow.\nThat said, I think, it is fair to say that we expect a very robust free cash flow environment for 2019. Almost at any level of capital spend that we choose, were going to have a robust free cash flow picture. I won't go to the exact number, but it will be very strong and we'll continue to use that very prudently as we invest for the company's future."]], ["Is there anything that would cause you to kind of move off of that number?\nAnd specifically my question is the margins for the specialty business were down year-over-year this quarter? ", ["Thanks, Seth. So a couple of points. I'd say 50% and we've always said this right? 50% is not a bad way to think about the incremental margins available in this business. So I'll say that full stop. But you got to make sure that you understand the ins and outs. It's a very sensitive calculation you heard me talk about that before. That said I think that's a reasonable starting point. It certainly is going to be impacted as we grow specialty disproportionately and that's something that we want to make sure that we\u2019re mindful of us to think about its impact on flow through, but the reality is specialty growth is a unilaterally or an unalloyed good thing from a top-line perspective, from a margin perspective, from a return perspective. So we want to keep going as rapidly as we prudently can.\nWith regard to specialties gross margin performance in the quarter specifically. It was impacted in this quarter and will be impacted to probably a lesser extent as we go forward by increased depreciation, right. Gross margin so depreciation is in there. That depreciation is heavily driven by the Cummins acquisition, right. We bought the Cummins assets in the second half last year, and that depreciation is showing up more and more in the TPP segment margins. That's a major impact there.\nWe also had a lot of pull-starts and you all know that the pull-starts margin performance early in its life will way down. So as you have relatively more of those it tends to depress the margin results until those cold start locations mature. So those two dynamics were really at play in the segment margin results. It still is a very attractive business specialty I'm talking about. It still delivers incremental returns and profitability and margin and so that growth story I think you'll see us continue to emphasize go forward."]], ["First in terms of \u2013 I mean, we see good sequential rate trends in the quarter for you, I think in terms of what you're seeing for the broader industry and insight that you get through data that Rouse collects and just whether or not you\u2019ve seen any cracks in the industry's commitments rates.

We are negotiating with the same customers and as far as I guess also part of that question is we've been asked so I'll answer it is how we are National Accounts versus your transactional accounts. We see a very similar pattern in the half for a while about pricing behavior and opportunity in both albeit at a lower base right? As you would have imagine our National Accounts leverage their spend they have a lower realized cost versus the transactional customer but this is across the board effort of rate management not just trying to find honey holes to get some rate and we are very disciplined about our rate management."]], ["Look I think consensus was probably still baking in at 1.5% to 2% rate environment for 2018 and I did say that based on the comments that you made about the carryover into this year last quarter, I mean pro forma pricing was up 2.7% year-on-year in the first quarter and you haven't seen that rate of growth in a few years, so look realizing guide on rate when you consider how tight the used equipment is right now? ", ["So is there a credible argument? Yes, there's a credible argument to do that and certainly you can make your own judgment about how likely that that is to happen. Our view is that the market environment certainly would support a good rate realization and I think the path that we are on, we're encouraged by that. 2.7%, if you asked us before the quarter whether we\u2019d be there, we probably say not yet.\nSo that's encouraging for us, right as we think about where things could go, so yes, credible environment. Maybe I\u2019ll take the opportunity just you said credible for 3% to 5% and take the opportunity maybe a question given the sequential path that we experienced in the first quarter.\nIf you repeated the last three quarters sequentials that we achieved last year with the start that we've had this year that number would take us to 2.9%. If you repeated sort of the average of the sequentials that we\u2019ve achieved in the last three quarters over the last three to five years with the start that we've had this year that sequential pattern would take us to about 2.5%.\nSo certainly feels reasonable to say we're in that 2.5% to 3% range and could we accelerate from here to get into 3% to 5% range that's not ridiculous. So hopefully that's helpful for you Ross."]], ["I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about whether you view \u2013 whether having any impact on the first quarter, if at all, a number of folks from channel have been complaining about seasonality this year more so than normal.

We attributed to two major factors for us, a little bit of weather and then the timing of the holiday. So the week leading up to Easter happened to fall in March. So we saw a little bit of drop off from our normal cycle, which we expected to pick that up in April, and as we sit here we're very comfortable that that things have had normalized for us to what more or like what we expected.\nSo I wouldn't see \u2013 I wouldn't be concerned about that. I\u2019d also point to the balance that we had. One thing I'm really encouraged about is the rate performance in Q1. And keeping that balance of rate and time is real important to us. We talked about that all the time. And last year, quite frankly, we dug a bit of a rate hole while having very strong time utilization. We\u2019re very conscious about not digging the rate hole this year because that first quarter compounds on it.

I think it gives us plenty of room to respond to the upside, if indeed it looks like we should be spending more. So I don't think we need to say that we're thinking any differently about our capital plan. It is still pretty early in the year to be talking about either increasing or decreasing for that matter. And so what I would say is let's have this conversation again at Q2 and we'll be able to make some more definitive statements about how the second quarter fleet on rent build and how that feels relative to our capital plan and we\u2019ll make it more definitive statement at that point."]], ["And are you seeing any other costs creep that's weighing on the incremental margin such as higher delivery costs that you call out or you have to manage through and I guess is the follow-up is there a risk that you'll see greater than previously anticipated equipment inflation due to higher steel costs, I think the vast majority of your purchase is under contract that you negotiate in the prior year but just want to confirm that? ", ["Thanks, Neil. On the cost question, I would point delivery cost in the quarter is something that has a focus from our management team. You guys have said this, you guys read the paper like we do and I'm sure you read about freight cost increases as fuels costs go up and as it becomes harder for the delivery companies to find track as well.\nWhen we use outside hollers, we face some of those same dynamics in the quarter that's not to say that we didn't have opportunities to manage better, our use of outside haulers that something that we were very heavily focused on but that was the dynamic that\u2019s played out in Q1 and then that we're going to be focused on for the remainder of the year.\nThe other operating cost items I put in the category of just sort of normal management operations focus right of that. We had little bit more over time in the first quarter than maybe we expect to coming in, for example. Well, that's just something that we can put some management elbow grease to and address as we go forward.\nSo those are probably the cost items that I would say we're focused on right here now as for equipment purchase price inflation and commodity prices, our purchases, the vast majority of them are covered by supply agreement that have fixed pricing over the course of this year.\nAnd so we would expect that the commodity prices won't drive very much in the way of inflation this year for us, obviously next year when we negotiate the terms for next year that will be a discussion point with the vendors and it will be a good old-fashioned arm wrestling match and we know how to do that and will do it vigorously from the time."]], ["Could you just give us some perspective maybe comparing it to past years, how sizable that looks, and your ability to win those, are they already in hand, are they bids to come and also just a feel for your win rate on bids, just if that's something you measure and something you can share?

So I'll just mention the win rate, it's something that we measure internally not something we talk about externally, but I would say as for as project pipeline, I specifically make comments about the industrial projects because that's a significant change on a year-over-year basis. We're seeing some nice industrial projects that are carrying over from last year, but that's pipeline seems to be increasing a little bit in the back half of 2018 on a year-over-year basis.\nAs far as commercial, I wouldn't tie just a major projects, I think it's broad geographically; broad by project mix and the demand is brought by product type and sector. Every vertical, every meaningful vertical that we track of end markets is up on a year-over-year basis. So the project commentary specifically that you heard was more about the back half of the year in the industrial sector, but overall I\u2019d say the pipeline is a strong and a little bit stronger in some areas this last year.\nMichael Kneeland\nThe other thing I would add that is if you take a look at all key indicators, they\u2019re positive. And if you take a look at the associated builders and contractors, backlog in the fourth quarter expanded to [9.67] months, which is the highest level ever achieved. So in Dodge Momentum Index is positive. The highest level in cycle, I can take through all of these items, but the bottom line is all of the key indicators remain positive.

So I think that story might be told by the impact of tax reform. Remember that the 100% depreciation under tax reform goes away after five years, so at some point that benefit is going to be reduced. Remember also that they placed caps on the amount -- the percentage of EBITDA that you need to be below in order to still deduct interest expense, we are below that cap currently but that cap changes from a percent of EBITDA to a percent of EBIT at some point in the next few years.

Getting much, much below 2.5 starts to become more inefficient and you don't get much in terms of protection against the downturn.\nSo that would be the argument I would make to the board but the board has their perspective on this issue right, and so going through that and discussing it and coming together on a point of view is what the process is that we're going to go through to decide where we end up in terms of the leverage. And it's going to be live and up by the fact that there may be deals that come along or the market strength may indicate that we need to spend more on capital as we go along.

Getting much, much below 2.5 starts to become more inefficient and you don't get much in terms of protection against the downturn.\nSo that would be the argument I would make to the board but the board has their perspective on this issue right, and so going through that and discussing it and coming together on a point of view is what the process is that we're going to go through to decide where we end up in terms of the leverage. And it's going to be live and up by the fact that there may be deals that come along or the market strength may indicate that we need to spend more on capital as we go along. So I'd say stay tuned is the way to think about it but certainly we're very pleased to be in a position where we can think about all these things at very large scale."]], ["Mike, I was curious in your comments about plant turnarounds later this year; it's kind of something that people have been waiting for -- I'm just curious if you could delve into that a little bit more and is that something that you're expecting and perhaps in guidance or is that something that's -- that would be an upside?

Look I mean the analysis that we did, there a lot of assumptions to it, so I don\u2019t want to go too far with the specific about 50% statements that I made.\nBut at the same time if we get rate to be mildly positive, if we continue to improve utilization, although that's big given the record nature of what we are doing now, but daily improve it just marginally and we are putting more growth capital into the business again that's an assumption not saying we are there yet.\nBut all those things are lining up, 50% is I wouldn't say a given, but it's certainly the starting point of the discussion about where flow through could go next year.

So we were up 68% year-over-year in Q2. That brings us to just under 5% of our total portfolio. So to answer your other questions if you want to look at our total energy exposure, we have about 5% of our business in upstream. About a little less than 2% midstream and about 7% in the downstream business.\nSo that that nets to a little under 12, technically 11.5% of what you would call energy exposure. And we're very, very comfortable at that level and we're encouraged to see the upstream and we've seen a lot of pickup in our pump business specifically in that sector as well as other verticals within the pump business. As far as Canada, our Canadian business is kind of tailored to cities, but all of the provinces actually had some growth.\nWe're little bit more challenged in Alberta, when you look at the country as a whole, our rental revenue was up 7.3% and that\u2019s almost 9% just under 9% volume, but still over 3% rate drag year-over-year on that business.

I think I recommended to somebody last night that if you sit down with a simple spread sheet and make some reasonable assumptions about what the share of business that NES contributes both this year and last year, you can frame out sort of in broad terms how to get to that four tens pro forma number and how that compares to the 1.2 as reported number.\nThe actual assumptions that go into your spread sheet about sort of the relative rates of NES versus us, we\u2019ve characterize broadly in the past as being double digits the difference, so that\u2019s the starting point. Obviously with United Rentals being the premium and that gives you a sense of overtime how much of gap there is to bridge.\nHow much that the gap we actually bridge and how quickly we actually bridge it, time will tell but that\u2019s the feel that you are playing on sort of double digits kind of number that we are working to make sense for our customer base as you go forward."]], ["As you guys step back and think about the market today, how would you characterize the supply demand balance within rental and where do you see that balance headed in the next few quarters as you think about the demand trends versus industry CapEx addition.

We feel strongly that's due to our density, allows us to do things that may be a regional or a local player can't do from time utilization prospect.\nMichael Kneeland\nBut thanks for recognizing the fact that we are putting an effort and changing our processes, there is a chart on our investor deck on page eight that shows the NES during the time of acquisition where it is today, and speaks volumes about our team stepping up and making sure that we leverage our capabilities to drive better time.\nThe question we have to ask ourselves is, is there more for us to pull and we do believe that as Mat mentioned earlier, our team has earned it and we want to continue to make sure that we meet that demand, but there is lot of things that we're working on and as you pointed out our processes and lean management is paying some dividend."]], ["I wonder if you just go back to SG&A for a minute and you talked about some of the compensation increase SG&A where you've had it that high and past 1Q is relative to sales was a little higher than we thought.

And again that $7 million reflects the change in accounting guidance about how the stock compensation expense is treated. But it also reflects, primarily reflects the fact that our stock price went up tremendous amount in quarter and so that increase shows up as stock compensation expense in the quarter.\nNow it comes out of adjusted EBITDA, it's wide and called out as a component of year-over-year change in adjusted EBITDA, but it was about $7 million of the $15 million, $16 million increase that we saw in the quarter.

I mean, what I would say, in as brief away as possible, in terms of impact and the approach that our new Behavioral President, Matt Peterson is taking is, I think, as most people know, Matt comes from a strong managed care background, spending the last decade or so with United Optum.\nAnd I think that he, as a consequence, has a perspective that there are real opportunities for us to partner with some of our managed care payers and create arrangements that are mutually beneficial to both the payer and the provider. In other words, help the payer control their utilization, but create a structure whereby when there is utilization, we are the beneficiary of that in a primary way.\nSo those conversations, I think, are underway. They\u2019re not necessarily ones that can be affected immediately. But I think over time will yield kind of a more collaborative sort of relationship with payers that, that should again be mutually beneficial and a win-win for both.\nI think the other thing that Matt brings to the table is a rigor and a discipline around process based on his experience, both in the managed care world, as well as in the military. He\u2019s got a lifelong career in the Air Force reserves.\nAnd in that sense, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s identified terribly new issues or different issues, a lot of things that we\u2019ve talked about before, things like denial management, the process of how we intake and evaluate patients, et cetera. But I think, Matt is bringing some, again, level of rigor and discipline to those processes that we haven\u2019t necessarily had before. And I think ultimately, that will certainly be helpful.\nIn terms of how that translates to the guidance. I think we took the position a couple of years ago, that it was difficult for us to predict when the behavioral business would inflect or when it would turn, we have firmly believed for some time that it will. We continue to believe that.\nWe continue to believe that the underlying demand will support an increase in our same-store admission growth at some point. But I think we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve been committed over the last certainly year or two to the idea that we\u2019re not going to try and get out in front and predict when that\u2019s going to happen.

There certainly are a couple that are a little closer to 50-50.\nWe would not enter into or I think it would be highly unlikely that we would enter into a joint venture in which we had less than a 51% share and basically the management control of the facility.

Now look, I'll also, again, say what I think is fairly obvious, I mean, we have expended substantial dollars in legal fees and other costs to defend this case. So at a minimum, I think on average, our costs associated with defending the case have been in excess of $10 million a year for the last five or six years. So we will free those costs up. We certainly have dedicated a significant amount of time and effort internally, certainly on the part of some individuals. I think we have made every effort to try not to distract our operators with the issues of this case.

Our Henderson facility continues to ramp up. But we're also making capacity expansion decisions in a number of our Vegas facilities, and I think those are benefiting as well. The Southern California, Riverside County market had a strong quarter. The Denison-North Dallas market had a strong quarter. Again, that was a market that I think has also benefited from some fairly substantial capital investment in the last year, and we did talk in Q1 about the fact that we expect that some of these capital investments would begin to yield both revenue and EBITDA returns in the back half of the year.\nAnd finally, I'll say something that I don't think I've said in a while, that South Texas, the McAllen market had a pretty strong second quarter and that's a market that, for the most part, has been lagging for us over the last several years.

That overall dynamic or that dynamic was offset overall by a bit of a shift in Q2 from adolescent business to adult business, adolescents tend to have a longer length of stay than adults.

", ["Sarah, I mean I think what we said in Q1 was two things. I mean, one is, we didn't see any reason why the early weakness in the first six to eight weeks of the year of surgical volumes would likely continue. And in fact, they did not. So I think I would particularly to in-patient surgical volumes, which were relatively flat in Q1, and up like 3% in Q2 and that -- I think resulted in a significant shift in acuity and revenue per unit. And I think, again, I would suggest that sort of revenue acuity and revenue per unit that we've seen for the first six months, so ought to generally be more in line with what we see in the second half of the year. But we did also make the point, when I think a number of people asked in Q1 about the -- sort of the guidance ramp and the earnings ramp for the year, and I think we did talk about any number of, I'll call them mid-sized capital projects in the $20 million, $30 million range where we're adding capacity of some sort. It could be beds, it could be ER capacity, it could be surgical capacity. But in any number of hospitals and markets in Las Vegas, in Denison, Texas, in McAllen, and I think we started to see in Q2, some of that.\nSo look, honestly, I think we expressed confidence in our ability to meet our guidance even after Q1, which I think some people found disappointing. But I think certainly after a strong Q2, we're feeling even more confident that our original guidance is very achievable."]], ["So it sounds like this was contemplated in your full year guidance, and I'm wondering if since the nice return that you got on these investments for expanding capacity in other areas, does it change your strategy on how competitive you want to be on that front, seeing the return that you got on these investments? ", ["Yes look, I think we have a point of view that, we look at capital investment opportunity, as we look at almost all capital deployment opportunities on very much of an individual basis. And so I think our point of view is that, money well spent, well targeted makes sense in a market where we can demonstrate that demand is there for a particular service or a particular investment and that's the way we look at it. I don't think we take the view that, if we have kind of a robust quarter, it's all of the sudden reason to invest more, or quite frankly the opposite, if we have a softer quarter, that is a reason to invest less. I think we have a long track record of being a pretty judicious employer of capital, and that's why I think we had the point of view, that as we invested capital in our markets in these strong franchises, that it would earn a return over a reasonable period of expectation, as we originally contemplated. And again, I think we're seeing that kick in, in Q2 and our guess is it will continue to kick in over the balance of the year, as our guidance is [indiscernible]."]], ["I guess Steve, with a little bit more of the details around the settlement known now at this point, I'm curious if you have sort of enough information to know if there is any change in operations expected?

But to be fair and for those who have followed us, the cadence of this process is largely in the government's control. So we've not always been as accurate as we would like in estimating these things. Obviously, we're much closer to the end, and hopefully that makes it a little bit easier to guesstimate the time frame in a more accurate way. But that would be our best guess, that we can wrap this up completely and tie a ribbon around it by mid-fall, and that would be when we make our payment. As far as changes to operations, we've made the point I think fairly consistently. We have vigorously defended ourselves for the five or six years of this investigation, feel that our processes, our compliance, infrastructure, etcetera are all fairly robust and quite conscientious and really, I don't think that with the exception of small tweaks here and there, that really changed fundamentally our own internal processes over the course of this investigation.\nWe've not seen a draft of a compliance agreement or corporate integrity agreement from the government, so I can't really respond in any way to say, this is how our behavior could or would change in response to that. But we're not expecting the government to require significant underlying changes to our fundamental operations. I think they will ask us to sort of strengthen and validate our compliance program, which we're more than prepared to do. But no, I don't think that we anticipate any significant changes to the underlying way that we approach this business."]], ["If I want to go to the behavioral business, I think I kind of conceptually understand the comment, that when length of stay drops, then it gives more room for admissions to increase and vice versa.

", ["Well, and again, those to me are just two discrete statements. I think we have said all along, that our confidence that the volumes in the business would grow, is that our own internal data suggests that there remains a significant amount of unmet demand and a significant amount of what we describe as, deflections. Patients who we are unable to admit at various times, because of different reasons. Again, I mean you touched on some of them, a lack of a physical bed, the lack of sufficient clinical staff, certain clinical criteria, the inability to treat a particular diagnosis, etcetera. And I think we are working and have been working over the last several years on those issues. We have clearly made progress. I mean the revenue growth in our behavioral division is much higher in 2019, than it was back in 2015 and 2016. We are the first to concede that improvements have come slower than we expected. But what has always reinforced our fundamental bullishness, is this idea that there is a significant amount of unmet demand out there, and that the demand sort of dynamic and demand equation has not really changed in any basic ways, since the business slowed three or four years ago."]], ["Just want to flush out, is there any of that observation noise still at play here or anything else to call out perhaps driving the optics or the stat that kind of makes up the overall revenue? ", ["Yes, I don't think so. I mean I will say, certainly as we -- when we talk to our operators, this issue of observation versus admission is an ongoing issue at this point, really with our commercial payers. So again, it's an ongoing issue that we're constantly addressing. We have devoted a significant amount of both internal and external resources to the proper classification of patients, and making sure that we get paid appropriately from our payers. But I don't think, to your question, it's really influencing the optics of admission growth etcetera. I don't think we're seeing significant changes, back and forth."]], ["And I guess just for us, there has been some continued ebb and flow and washed [ph] in this year, just around the push for greater transparency in hospital pricing and actually healthcare pricing overall. ", ["Look, I think as Steve -- the transparency tends to focus on two things. One is transparency for the individual patient, who does not have insurance or has a significant self-paid portion of insurance that is trying to negotiate a particular rate. Honestly, I think that affects a relatively small percentage of the population and a small percentage of the procedures. Healthcare is complicated and sometimes it's not always easy to just say, look I'm having gallbladder surgery, I want to know exactly what it's going to cost, that may be a difficult exercise for an individual patient.\nThe other dynamic, which seems to be the focus of at least some legislators, is this idea that there ought to be complete transparency at the rates paid between private insurers and private hospitals, whether that is a concept that really will get traction and also proved to be legal, etcetera. I'm not sure. But at the end of the day, I believe that the broad outlines of that sort of pricing landscape are out there, I use the sort of easy example that if we've got a payer who is our -- the number one player in the market, and it becomes public knowledge that the rates that we accept from that payer are the lowest in the market. To me that's not a surprise. It's not a surprise to us, it\u2019s not a surprise to the payers in the market, and if a much smaller payer comes to us and says, well, now that I know that you accept much lower rates than this payer, we want you to accept the same rates from us. We are just not going to do it and no one is going to be able to force us to do that, unless the government decides that they're just going to set prices all around. And I don't think it's going to be the case. So I don't think we view transparency as something that will change our everyday business practices by a great deal."]], ["I appreciate your view of looking at it sort of over a six month period, but within that period, it sounds like there's a little bit of a difference in the second quarter of improvement, particularly McAllen and maybe Denison as well. ", ["Yes, I mean I think that's difficult to do, Peter. I think, you know what I was suggesting is that, earlier in Q1, there was a lot of focus on this idea that some people felt like the ramp for the balance of the year was aggressive or more dramatic than they imagined, etcetera, and we simply suggested that, the cumulative effect of these sort of mid-sized capital projects, was something that we thought was helping this ramp as the year went on. And that we were making the point I think, or I was making the point that, because it was not a whole hospital project like a Henderson or Temecula from several years ago, we tend not to talk about these individual projects, And therefore I cited and I saw it as a potential disconnect between our own internal model and the Street model. Look, at the end of the day, sort of our guidance is our guidance, and I think it suggests to -- not just suggests, it very explicitly said to The Street, this is what we expect our earnings power to be for the balance of the year, and our guidance remains unchanged, and I would just broadly say, we continue to have confidence in our full year guidance. Obviously, we sort of never really get into what the Texoma emergency room impact likely to have. I just don't think quite frankly that's a terribly productive conversation, when you get down to that granular level of detail."]], ["Just wondering like what actually has changed like at the local field level in that division, and what we should expect to see in terms of changes in terms of initiatives and strategy going forward?

And so I think we would like to use the opportunity to at least reevaluate a potential sort of strategic reset. And that, I think, kind of a complete overhaul of the business, so I think we have a very successful business. But as we think about new technologies and things like telemedicine, the use of telemedicine in the behavioral space, or how the behavioral slice of the business interacts with the broader population management initiatives that we see in the healthcare, I think probably, to your point, as you frame the question, a year from now, I would guess that we may be talking about those dynamics more, than we had in the past, and I think where we're hoping that the opportunity to hire a new person with some different experience, etcetera, will allow us to engage and maybe more productively in those conversations."]], ["Now that we're at 4% unemployment wherever we are, I think most investors, at least in my conversations really struggle to see how acute care hospitals aren't seeing more pressure around staffing costs, and what are you seeing and how do you address the question and maybe if you could comment more specifically on contract labor and professional fees. ", ["Sure. Look Whit, I think broadly your comments are fair, finding a sufficient number of qualified clinical personnel in -- frankly in either business segment, whether that's nurses or doctors, is definitely challenging, and a very significant portion of our operators' efforts I think are focused on recruitment and retention, again, of qualified clinical personnel, whether that's nurses or doctors. Look, the issue again, when you talk about -- when you sort of look at 4% unemployment, how are we not more challenged. I mean, I think we are challenged, but this is always one of those things where we don't have to outperform 99% of the universe. We just have to outperform our local competitors, who are basically -- who we're competing for, for those clinical personnel. And so, we work very hard at recruitment and retention policies that allow us to do that.\nIt's a big focus and I think our flexibility, our willingness to be creative, etcetera, helps us in that endeavor. But it's absolutely a challenge. And look, I think one of the reasons why the two businesses appear not to have as much cost pressure, as you might expect is, we saw a lot of that cost pressure two or three years ago. Frankly, I think as a company, we talked about it a lot more in 2015 and 2016 than many of our peers. I don't know if that's because we were feeling it sooner in our markets or just because maybe we were being more realistic about the impacts of it. But I think to a degree, what we're seeing now two or three years later is that, those pressures at least as they are reflected in the financial statements, have anniversaried themselves and have largely sort of stabilized."]], ["And my last one, maybe this one more for Alan, if he's still listening, I was just thinking about Intermountain acquiring Healthcare Partners Nevada and just what are the implications of that? ", ["Yes, I mean I'll answer that. [Indiscernible] we've routinely discussed here, so I think we're of the same mind. Look, I think the good news, as this process unfolded, we had concerns that United would be able to keep this business, and I think that would have created a real competitive advantage for them. So when the FTC required them to sell this business, I think that -- we view that as a favorable development. I guess, ideally, we would have liked for the business to be sold to a payer, who would have no real presence in the market, that would have been sort of perfect from our perspective. But the fact that the business has been sold to a provider, who doesn't really have much of a presence in the market, I think is kind of maybe the next best thing. Look, I think it's a signal as you sort of alluded to in your question, that over time, Intermountain probably will -- either has plans or will execute plans to develop some sort of provider present in the market. But obviously, that will take some time, and they will have some obstacles to overcome, in a market that is sort of well entrenched amongst a small number of providers. So we face sort of competitive dynamics in all of our markets. This will be a new one in Las Vegas. But it's not one that at the moment we're losing sleep over.

And the reality, even though there are sort of the anecdotal stories that can be rather sort of lurid, is that most patients like that really don't wind up paying what I would sort of call retailer sticker prices.\nSo there's a lot a focus on it. I don't know that it's \u2013 we certainly have complied. We post our prices, as you're supposed to now, on our website. But I don't know that it really addresses a significant problem. I think it's one of the solutions in search of a problem. I do think that there are other kind of initiatives in what I'll call the billing and collection area that I think do \u2013 will get more traction and will put more pressure on some providers.\nThat includes what \u2013 sort of under the umbrella this kind of broad surprise billing, which is generally sort of an out-of-network billing dynamic. These are for what I think are generally hospital-based physicians, ER physicians, anesthesiologists, et cetera, who may be not in-network when a hospital is in-network. We have very few of those cases. We really require our hospital-based physicians to be generally in any networks that we're in. So we don't think that's much of an issue.

I understand the point you're making that I think is people model often that other operating expense model is usually just going up by kind of an inflation rate.\nI will say the one functional area that's included in that, that has seen some pressure is that's where we record our locums or temporary physician costs. It's where we record a lot of our contract service physician costs for things like ER subsidies or if there are appropriately anesthesia or hospital subsidies. Those expenses get recorded in that other operating expense line.

As you might imagine, when a patient is seen in our hospital and then is readmitted, it's not always to one of our hospitals. So we don't always I think have complete or perfect information on readmissions. Sometimes, the state will have that. Sometimes, the payers will share that.\nSometimes we can \u2013 there are other ways that we can get it. But we do make the argument, in many cases, to the payers that we think that some of this pressure on length of stay is really not suitable or not appropriate for the long-run care of the patient because we think that \u2013 and we can at least prove, in some of our cases, where we have the information that patients who were discharged earlier are being readmitted more frequently.

So we've talked, certainly for the last few quarters about changes in the addiction treatment business model that certainly the Foundations Recovery Network represented, that wasn't addiction treatment model that really relied heavily on direct to consumer marketing, either through the media, television and radio or through the Internet, there has been a number of changes in that sort of marketing, particularly in the Internet and some of the search engine logic that's made patient capture more difficult for providers over the last several years. Also, and I think many providers have acknowledged this that business has moved over the last several years from an out-of-network model to more of an in-network model and that certainly results in lower reimbursement.\nFoundations also relied more heavily on a travel-to-treatment model in which patients would often travel longer distances sort of outside of their home markets to get what they consider to be sort of the best treatment available. I think payers are, have been more restrictive about those kinds of decisions, et cetera. So all those things have, I think affected the growth trajectory of that business. And then as you pointed out, and certainly we've acknowledged that and talked about that for some time. And then in the fourth quarter, I think our most profitable facility in the foundations portfolio, our addiction treatment facility in Malibu, California was closed as a result of the wildfires there.

We've maintained margins in the mid '20s, I think it would be unrealistic to expect quite candidly that until we can engineer or restore that and that sort of historical level of revenue growth at around the 5%, that add 2% or 3% growth. It's possible to really have any sort of measurable either margin expansion or EBITDA growth et cetera.\nWe certainly strive for that and we strive to be as efficient as possible, but the nature of the operating model is that most of our costs are fixed and semi-fixed. So where you really generate the leverage in this model is through at least modest revenue growth, and until you get that it's hard.

And then we had $10 million to $12 million of California UPL, all related to 2018 that we recorded in the third quarter that had we know and everything we knew in Q3, we could have and probably, appropriately would have recorded more ratably over the first three quarters of 2018.\nSo that made, the first two quarters look a little softer and the third quarter look a little stronger.

I think we have a point of view that this is a constantly changing market dynamic that we are monitoring all the time.\nThe wages are the result of a competitive tension in a market and so, we are always evaluating and reevaluating base wages where always evaluating and reevaluating what others are doing regarding incentives, sign-on bonuses, retention bonuses, all kinds of nuance ways to approach labor recruitment and it may vary quite frankly by markets.\nSo, the point that you raised is certainly one that we can see that before which is, wage inflation is certainly higher today for both our behavioral business and our acute business than it was three or four years ago and that\u2019s why we say that our underlying business model has changed.\nSo, it\u2019s four years ago we might have said that 5% behavioral growth would yield 7% or 8% or 9% EBITDA growth and today I think we suggest that it would yield 6% or 7% EBITDA growth and I think the reason or the main variable there is the wage inflation.\nBut, again, this idea of sort of kind of looking at it at sort of a linear issue that where 60% of the way there, 80% of the way there or 100% of the way there, I think is the wrong way of looking at it, because particularly in this very tight labor environment, I think it\u2019s going to be an ever changing dynamic."]], ["So, I guess, I am just curious if you are able to provide any high-level color just on your current appetite for larger-scale M&A on the behavioral side, given that historically you\u2019ve been successful completing some larger deals.

I think we say all the time and we say it because it\u2019s true that we will explore and evaluate any opportunities that are presented to us.\nAnd we are going to look for the highest returns and as I said, in I think response to A.J.\u2019s question earlier, we think we have a lot of opportunities to do that whether it\u2019s organic capital investment, whether it\u2019s share repurchase which we think is pretty compelling or whether it\u2019s inorganic M&A, we are going to pursue all those opportunities or at least from an evaluation perspective."]], ["Maybe one just real quick confirmation question, just quickly on this discussion on your strong acute same-store revenue growth in 3Q and there was obviously a lot of industry discussion earlier this year around perhaps some acceleration of this greater acuity trend within the in-patient setting.\nYou guys have somewhat dismissed that notion earlier this year for yourselves as far anything out of the ordinary and it sounds like for 3Q 2018, that might be the case again. ", ["Yes, I don\u2019t know that we dismissed that notion. I mean, I think what I have said in the past is, actually it seems to be \u2013 it seems to make intellectual sense that what we are seeing is a rise in acuity in the acute care business.\nGetting back to the question before that seeing more ambulatory and alternative site competition, it makes sense that the business that remains in the acute care hospital is higher acuity business and that the level of acuity would therefore sort of be rising naturally in the acute care industry just generally.\nSo, I think we sign on to that. I think we believe also that, acute care hospitals in general in UHS specifically has been focused in the last several years on more disciplined documentation, clinical, efforts to improve clinical documentation on the part of physicians and hospital itself. So, I think that\u2019s having an impact as well. So, I think there is to that element where those elements are contributing to the increase in acuity. And so, I don\u2019t know that we discount that."]], ["And as you look at your portfolio of hospitals across various markets, and you look at the macro labor trends and the cyclical trends.\nAny color you can offer us on market-specific on a same-store basis, what the volumes are looking like and if certain markets are beginning to top out.

One is, I think geographically, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent for several years now about sort of what our geographic trends look like that the strongest markets, the strongest performing markets have been Las Vegas, and Riverside County California and North Dallas, the District of Columbia.\nThe weaker markets on the acute side have been South Texas and Amarillo. Again, those trends really have not varied much in the last several years. I think more broadly, I would say that, those markets, those really strong performing markets from a UHS perspective really saw some very extraordinary growth over the last several years, as we benefited from the ACA and Medicaid expansion and economic improvement again in those markets that I ticked off.\nAnd I think from our perspective, we were likely to see some moderation in our acute care performance, which I think we saw a little bit in 2018, I think some of our peers who are now seeing some strength in their markets are just sort of maybe a little bit behind that cyclical curve from where we were. But I think they are sort of experiencing what we might have experienced a year or two in terms of really extraordinary growth. But I think we continue to put up very solid numbers in our acute care segment."]], ["Can you just say how was, in the Behavioral business specifically, you had some negative hurricane impact last quarter or last year in the fourth quarter I should say, it was in Puerto Rico. ", ["Sure. So, and thanks for bringing that up, Justin, because, I probably should have mentioned that before. So, I did I think say in response to a question about the strong behavioral admissions earlier on the call that some of that \u2013 strong performance in this year\u2019s Q3, because of the comparison to last year where we had a hurricane impact, by the way not just in Puerto Rico.\nBut we had \u2013 I think it was Hurricane Harvey in Houston and I think Irma in the Southeast. And then, we had a little bit of an impact from Hurricane Florence this year, but I think for the most part, it was fairly minimal. But in Q4, we had Hurricane Michael, hard to keep track of all the names. We had Hurricane Michael which did unfortunately do significant damage to our facility in Panama City, Florida, which is now closed and probably will remain closed for four to six months.\nThe good news is, all patients and employees were safe and nobody was injured, but that will probably be a $5 million, $6 million $7 million drag in Q4. So, as I was talking about the guidance for the fourth quarter, I should have made the point that, where we originally thought that we\u2019d have a pick up, because we had a drag in Q3 of last year \u2013 or Q4 of last year rather where we will probably have a relatively comparable drag in Q4 of this year from our Panama City facility."]], ["On the \u2013 going back topic of the day, I guess, the length of stay pressure on the behavioral side, are you seeing that primarily on IPF or is it also the RTC?

We see a couple of residential facilities which has experienced some length of stay pressure.

", ["So I think, Peter, in both Q1 and Q2 we talked about not only in our 2018 guidance but sort of ours (17:28) kind of sustainable growth rate for the Acute division over the next several years would yield kind of 5% to 6% revenue growth and comparable maybe 6% to 7% EBITDA growth. The 5% to 6% revenue growth numbers we've hit in Q1 and Q2. I think what you're alluding to is that EBITDA growth and profitability was a little bit lighter than we expected although I think, again, our own internal expectations seem to be lower than the Street's and then think in part we were acknowledging that particularly in Q2 we had a pretty tough comparison not only to last year but I think to a couple years of very robust growth, both revenue-wise and profitability-wise in the Acute business, and some slowing.\nI think we've also found over the last several years even though the trajectory of the Acute business has generally been rather positive and pretty robust, there's a little more volatility in that business I think than we have found in the Behavioral business. And so I think we largely attribute the second quarter lightness and the margin contraction sequentially to just some of that intra-quarter volatility in that. I think our point of view is still that over time if we can grow that business 5% to 6% at the revenue line that EBITDA growth in the 6% to 7% range should follow. Even though we didn't hit those numbers exactly in Q2, I think we think that over time, and I think if you go back and you look at our performance over time you'll see that that's true."]], ["Steve, I think you mentioned looking for sort of an acceleration in the Behavioral same-store revenue growth number in 2Q to instill confidence in that 5% target, and I think the timeline there most recently was sort of 3Q. ", ["Yeah. Look, I mean I think one of the challenges that we've had, Steve, is that we saw this slowdown in our Behavioral revenue growth really begin in the back half of 2015, and we attributed most of that slowdown to a labor shortage of particularly nurses but, to a lesser degree, psychiatrists. And I would say for about a year we focused on that and really kind of redid a lot of our infrastructure to be able to better address the shortage. And I think beginning in the back half of 2016 we began to make measurable progress and both our volumes and our revenues began to increase.\nAs we sort of projected how that would continue to play out, we tended to project that as sort of a ratable increase. The reality is the business doesn't necessarily work that way and the recovery has been somewhat choppier and, to be fair, somewhat slower than we originally imagined as well. We still think that that 5% target is reasonable, that 5% revenue growth target is reasonable. We still have it out there for the back half of the year. It's part of our guidance and I think we presume that we can get there or get pretty close. But we acknowledge that it's a bit choppy. And again, I think as I sort of commented on in responding to A.J.'s original question, we find that we're making progress in some areas like the shift of services from residential to acute and reduction in denials, but in others and solving the labor shortages is a bit more problematic than we thought. But we think we're continuing to make progress and feel like that 5% target is still reasonable."]], ["And then you mentioned that the challenge has been to kind of make sure that your beds are staffed and that you're adding beds in the places where there's capacity issues. ", ["Yeah. I think, look, the challenge in describing it \u2013 and look, I understand when people question and try and get a sense of this issue, they tend to view it in sort of a linear fashion that it's kind of an issue that we have X number of vacancies and that represents Y percentage of our total labor slots, and we filled so many of them and so we've made this much progress. But the reality is particularly in an industry like ours that has such high turnover rates, I think nursing turnover nationally in the U.S. is in the 30% range, the issue is we hire nurses, nurses leave; we hire psychiatrists, psychiatrists leave. We sort of solve the labor problem in a hospital and we don't have any sort of restriction on bed capacity in that hospital, and then the issue arises at another hospital in another market.\nIt has always remained throughout this I think a relatively small number of markets and small number of hospitals that have been affected. But to be fair, part of the challenge is we'll solve the problem at two hospitals and it'll arise at another hospital, et cetera. So that's part of the reason it's been sort of a slower recovery. But I find it difficult to sort of be able to quantify kind of in a percentage way or something like that how much progress we've made and how much is left to go.\nI guess what I always point to \u2013 and by the way, I do this internally as well \u2013 is I just focus people on the level of revenue growth because in my mind ultimately that's how the progress is measured. A problem manifested itself in a slowdown in our revenue growth, and in my mind it will be completely fixed when we recover that level of revenue growth. So while I think there are metrics and measurements that you can use to sort of help define your progress \u2013 number of vacancies, turnover rate, number of people in orientation; all those sorts of things which we get internally \u2013 I think ultimately our main focus continues to be on that revenue growth metric."]], ["I think maybe just last question on this topic would just be that I think people think that the labor market is getting tighter and that staffing is getting more difficult.

I think our sense is they have generally stabilized now that we're a couple years into it. But having said that, I think we acknowledge we're in a very tight labor market. As a nation, we're at the lowest unemployment rates we've seen in 20 or 30 years depending on exactly who is quoting that.

Now I will say that our revenue per unit has been relatively strong, although I think we've talked a lot about in 2017 that I think some of that was due to more inpatient admissions and fewer observation patients, and I think we still are benefiting from that to a degree. I think generally the industry is also benefiting from kind of a stabilization. We've all been focused on this sort of trend of moving the lower acuity outpatient procedures out of the inpatient setting and into other outpatient settings, either in the hospital or out of the hospital, and I think that's hurt acuity over the last several years. But I think we've seen kind of a stabilization and a bottoming out of that trend, so I think that's helping acuity as well. So I think we're benefiting from that. It's difficult for me to say that our peers are benefiting in the same way, but it just seems like the numbers across the industry are reasonably consistent, so I would guess that we're all benefiting in the same way."]], ["Just all it said was I believe that unemployment going down in their view might be finally driving some of the, as I understood, some of the commercial volume pickup, payor mix pickup.

I think it's reflective of the underlying strength of the acute care business particularly for companies that have strong franchises in robust markets. But I will say one of the challenges for us is those kinds of numbers that were in the HCA second quarter release were numbers that our Acute Care division has been putting up in a number of quarters over the last several years. And one of the challenges that we face is those comparisons have become more and more difficult for us.\nSo when we started to put up really strong numbers Las Vegas and California and to a lesser degree Florida, but at the end of 2013 and into 2014 and 2015 we're into sort of the fourth or fifth year of that recovery in our end markets. And so I just think that comparison is a little more challenging for us. But again, I think to the degree that any of our peers are experiencing those underlying strong metrics, that's a good sign for us."]], ["The other driver I think that's being mentioned just more broadly is about mix shifting to lower cost sites of service, and that's what's driving potentially the higher pricing growth in the inpatient setting and so on.

I mean I think you make the right point, and that is if we acknowledge \u2013 which I think we all do \u2013 that lower acuity business has been shifted out of the acute care hospitals into a whole variety of other lower cost and lower care settings, whether they're ambulatory surgery centers or freestanding EDs or urgent care centers, then by definition what's left in the acute hospital is the more acute, the more severely ill patient. And I think you would expect that acuity measures or revenue per unit measures would be going up which I think is what we've seen certainly in the first six months of 2018."]], ["You had California provider tax, you had some health plans improving, you had the flu incident, et cetera, that would seem to be a more challenging quarter for Acute EBITDA growth.

I think my comments about the easier comparisons in the back half of the year earlier in the call was really \u2013 or I meant it to be specific to the Behavioral business, not to the Acute business. So again, and I think the way you described it is correct. I think the third quarter comparison for the Acute business is not too bad but the fourth quarter was a real bang-up quarter largely because of the real busy flu season and some other issues.

We certainly have taken the investigation very seriously. We've reviewed carefully all the documents that have been provided to the government and have tried to look at them in a very sort of comprehensive way. So, looking at them to analyze whether they are indicative of internal issues or things that we ought to be fixing et cetera.\nLook, I think, like every organization, if you're going to take that hard of a look at yourself internally, you're always going to find small things that you're going to tweak, and I think we've done that. But in general, I think we have felt like the investigation really has not uncovered or identified significant or pervasive problems within the behavioral health division, within our practices, within our protocols, sort of all the things that you talked about. And honestly, we have made that argument very vigorously to the government."]], ["Like, is it just Street mis-modeling, or is there anything getting better in the third quarter or kind of annualizing in the third quarter that you think we should keep in mind?

But I'll simply make the point that our full year guidance is within, I think, $0.01 or $0.02 off the Street's consensus for the year. And so, again, I think we are largely on target and the only difference is timing. And I will suggest, as I did earlier on the call, that I think the bulk of that timing was that we had a less robust Q1, largely, I think, for the reasons I just enumerated, and we have a more robust Q3, largely because I think a lot of the negative issues that we had last year occurred in Q3 and then in Q4, so the comparison becomes much easier. But I'm not going to tell people exactly how they should model the year. But hopefully, this discussion gives people a pretty good sense of how we're looking at the trajectory of the rest of the year."]], ["So I just want to understand kind of what levels of adjusted admits you're assuming for the balance of the year, both in acute and behavioral, kind of, at the low and the high end of guidance? ", ["Yeah. I mean, I'm just going to repeat the comments that we made in our Q4 call, which was that our guidance for the year presumes that acute care revenue growth would be in that sort of 5.5% to 6% range and it would be split pretty evenly between volumes and price. And again, I think that's pretty much we ran in the first quarter. In the first quarter, we were a little bit more skewed to price than to volumes, and I suspect those numbers might bounce around a little bit during the year.\nOn the behavioral side, we talked about getting to something close to 5% same-store revenue growth by the third quarter. And we imagine that would be 3% to 4% volume and 1% to 2% price. In Q1, we did actually better on the pricing side. I think as we have pressured our payers for some price increases to offset, quite frankly, some of the other volume pressures that we see, but I think that remains our projection.\nNow again, the ramp for behavioral or the behavioral results for the year presume much more of a ramp, that each quarter we presume that the revenue growth will incrementally increase a little bit differently than on the acute side where we thought it would be pretty steady and ratable."]], ["And then, I think, in the past, you've talked about some of the relationships with some of your referrals sources from acute care hospitals to your freestanding behavioral hospitals, about the mix of the referrals that you've seen. ", ["So, I think your first question, Frank, I think, is really asking for kind of a preliminary read on the outpatient activity in Q2. Honestly, I think what I've said to people historically is, inpatient volumes is something that we literally get sort of a daily real-time read on. Most of the other data within our two businesses, we get some anecdotal feedback on things like outpatient revenue and surgical trends, et cetera, but nothing terribly precise.\nMy gut reaction, and again, this is more anecdotal and subjective, from talking to our folks out in the field is that, yeah, in these markets where we had a bad weather first quarter, the volumes and the activity have rebounded in Q2, but I don't have a lot of data to support that. We'll have to wait for another month or two to see whether that proves out to be correct.\nI think your second question, it really talked about the fact that we have indicated in 2017 that our Medicaid utilization had risen. To some degree, we attributed that to the IMD exclusion being lifted. But I think we also suggested that in some markets, some of our referral sources, our acute care hospitals, ERs in particular, were being more selective in sending us sometime some of their Medicaid patients, but not necessarily Medicare and commercial.\nI think that's a pretty sort of specific sort of comment, and in those markets, we are sort of addressing that with our referral sources. I would say, generally, our payer mix has remained pretty stable in Q1 and has not changed a great deal."]], ["And you talked about sort of the shift back of observation in patient and now it normalizing.\nI think I'm just not sure I'm following the dynamics on the impact on the pricing side and why would that have the impact of popping the pricing stat. ", ["Yeah. I mean, again, I think the dynamic is simply that, if what you're doing is converting those observation patients, a portion of observation patients to inpatients, what it will do will increase the number of admissions and drive a higher than sort of, I'll call it, average admission growth rate, which I think was happening in 2018 and which I think we called out multiple times.\nBut at the same time, it tends to lower the average revenue per admission, because by definition, those patients who are on the bubble of meeting admission criteria are your least acute patients. They're not open-heart surgery patients, they're not hip implant patients, they're not \u2013 your ER trauma patients, they're patients who are, again, at a lower acuity levels. So again, admitting them drives higher inpatient admission numbers, but tends to drag down that overall revenue per admission."]], ["And then the second piece of that which is the \u2013 on the pricing side, is there anything more in terms of either pure pricing increases that you're getting, payer mix or acuity mix to comment that might have helped us stack this quarter.

", ["No. Look, I think, Ana, we have the same general point of view as most of our acute care peers, both for-profit and not-for-profit have, and that is, we know that a significant portion of the business has shifted to ambulatory settings. It so happens that investment in the ambulatory business tends by its nature to be just smaller, costs $10 million to build a freestanding emergency department as opposed to the $200 million of cost to build a freestanding hospital. So we don't necessarily call it out.\nBut we have, and have mentioned previously, probably a dozen freestanding EDs, for example, that are either operational or under development at the moment in a number of geographies. We have primary care physician sites in a bunch of our hospitals, we have some urgent care sites, some outpatient imaging ambulatory sites. And again, every one of those strategies is tailored to the markets. So no, honestly, I think in the markets that we're in, we're as aggressively investing in the ambulatory business as any of our peers."]], ["On procedure volumes and seasonality, there was a little bit of something in the hurricane, but it felt like 4Q was steeper last year than it has been in the past. ", ["It's a good question, Ana. Honestly, not one that I think we are best positioned to answer. As you know, I think there were a lot of sort of experts, if you will, who predicted that Q4 volume for hospital providers would be higher because so many more plans had higher copays and deductibles that would encourage their subscribers to have ambulatory source of elective procedures at the end of 2017 if they had exhausted their copays and deductibles. And that in turn, Q1 volumes could be somewhat lower. But this advantage that we have at the moment is, number one, we don't know what our hospital peers are going to report over the course of the next week or two weeks, so that's hard to measure. And it's just very difficult for us to measure whether patients in total, have more patients have exhausted their copays or deductibles, et cetera. I think the insurers are much better positioned to do that. So honestly, I think later in the year, maybe in Q2 or Q3, we'll be able to look back and see if there was kind of more of a seasonality shift in Q4 and Q1, but at the moment, I think that's very difficult for us to do with any level of precision or objectivity."]], ["So for shareholders and analysts who are really stuck while you are fixing these issues, at what point do you look at the share performance over the past two years and decide, need to unlock the value of the company because I would argue this company has a lot of value.

Length of stay, which has been a pressure point at various times during 2017, did pressure our overall volume growth and therefore, our overall revenue growth in the quarter. And I think, Justin, as your question suggests, we believe that most of that pressure was a result of payer mix issues. And when I say that, I really mean just an increase in Medicaid patients and a decline mostly in Medicare patients. And our Medicaid patients generally have a lower length of stay. So, to the degree, we have more Medicaid and less Medicare patients, our overall length of stay will naturally decline somewhat, and I think we saw that in Q4.\nOur expectation is that the underlying demand for our behavioral beds and our behavioral services remains rather strong. We're going to continue to market and focus on all of those who are demanding our services, but especially for Medicare and commercial patients for whom we may have seen some slight decline in business. And that will help restore both the length of stay and the revenue trajectory so that we can get back to this 5% same-store revenue growth target that we have talked about for some time and that we \u2013 our guidance assumes that we'll achieve that sometime in the middle of 2018."]], ["It sounds like you're saying that length of stay is under pressure in part because of payer mix shifts, but I want to understand why you're seeing those payer mix shifts.

I think that we are seeing more Medicaid patients because the IMD exclusion has been lifted and because in any number of our facilities we can now be reimbursed for adult Medicaid patients for whom we were unable to be reimbursed for many, many years. So, that I think has contributed to the surge in Medicaid patients to a degree.\nI think that there is a lot of competition for some of these other payer classes like Medicare and commercial, both with other freestanding facilities and also with acute care hospitals who operate behavioral units. One of the things that we have focused a great deal on is the idea that a number or many Medicare behavioral patients also have certain physical or medical surgical ailments, and payers sometimes and patients and families presume that they can be better treated in an acute care setting.\nWe've focused very much on an ability to treat those kinds of patients, or at least a subset of those kinds of patients, in our behavioral freestanding facilities as well. So, we're very focused on treating those elderly behavioral patients who also may be medically compromised. I think that there's been increased competition for those patients. So, I think it's a function, again, as you suggested in your question, of both just an increased flow of Medicaid patients because of the lifting of the IMD exclusion, and an increased competition for some of those other patients, particularly Medicare patients, amongst all providers."]], ["In the past, you talked about getting to that 5%, 5.5% range, and then when length of stay started to pressure, you kind of said, well, we can still probably get there. ", ["Yeah, I mean \u2013 and I'm not sure that I wouldn't characterize the trend a little differently than you, Kevin. I think we saw our admissions decline fairly precipitously back in right around the middle of 2015. We largely attributed that decline to labor shortage and a shortage of clinicians, mostly nurses, but to a lesser degree, psychiatrists in some markets. We spent a good year or so addressing that issue and I think began to really make progress on filling many of those vacancies in the middle of 2016.\nAnd I think if you go back, you'll see that actually admission growth from about the middle of 2016 to the middle of 2017 really did increase pretty ratably and steadily, which I think, now, I think, is where your question is more valid. It stalled a little bit in the last couple of quarters because of this length of stay pressure. I think what keeps us or why we remain confident is that when we look at the number of patients that are being presented to our facilities, who sometimes we're unable to treat, either because we don't have all of the clinicians we need, or we don't have all the beds we need, or because they're medically compromised, as I was recently just alluding to, I think we think the demand is there, and that's why we continue to talk about being able to get to that 5% number.\nNow, again, I'll be the first to acknowledge that this has been kind of a greater slog and has taken more time than we originally anticipated. But I think we believe firmly that the underlying demand remains strong and is sufficient to get us back to that 5% growth."]], ["Just moving to the UK knowing I know it's small for you, but there has been talks from the peer around a shift in local governments and some \u2013 that demand going to the competition and others perhaps, I don't know whether they're getting treated or is it kind of creating a pent up demand situation. ", ["Well, I think it's worth reinforcing your first comment, which is that our footprint in the UK is extremely small in comparison to our public company peer. And therefore, I'm not sure that our experience is necessarily indicative or their experience is necessarily indicative of ours. I will say that 2017 was largely a transition year for us.\nAs I mentioned in a previous response, we did the Cambian acquisition at the very end of 2016 and spent most of 2017 working with the CMA in the UK on the outcome of that acquisition and what facilities would have to be sold. We were very pleased with the outcome of that process. We had to sell a single facility with less than a $1 million of EBITDA. And so, I think we felt like that work and that interaction with the CMA was worthwhile.\nBut part of the outcome of that process is we were not able to combine our two businesses really until very late in 2017. So, we really weren't able to share best practices or achieve any synergies, et cetera. So, I think for us, 2018 will be a much better gauge of what we can do in the UK. Look, we would acknowledge that like in the U.S., it's a tight behavioral market, but I think Cambian in particular has had historical success at really minimizing the use of temporary nurses and registry. And we're hoping to use their best practices in our legacy facilities.\nAnd I don't know that we've seen the same pressure on our volumes that our public company peer has seen. And, again, we're in a much smaller number of markets and in different markets. But I think we've said pretty consistently, we haven't necessarily experienced those same issues."]], ["And I guess one of the things that is still interesting to me, I guess in response to my earlier question, is that you're still looking at the same kind of rebound and reacceleration in the business. ", ["Yes. I mean so I think that in Q3 we did actually see the length of stay decline, diminish from the rate at which it was declining in Q2. So I think sequentially we made some progress. I think our point of view that we articulated last quarter was we certainly feel like there are some things that we may be able to do to impact length of stay where that's clinically appropriate. But then if we couldn\u2019t, that we had a point of view that the underlying demand was strong enough and the reservoir of unmet demand of patients looking to be admitted to behavioral hospitals, was strong enough that we just needed to improve the efficiency of our throughput, so that if beds were being vacated earlier because of length of stay pressure, we just needed to increase the throughput and fill those beds sooner, again always where clinically appropriate. And I think that's our point of view and why I think we had the perspective that this 5% same store revenue growth target that we've essentially set for the behavioral division, because that's what we were running back in 2000 when we started to see some diminution in that number, is achievable. It\u2019s really the confidence that allows us to say that is this the metrics that we continue to see internally that demonstrate a there's a significant reservoir of unmet demand."]], ["Because again in general, we're hearing companies talk more about labor pressure rather than less about it, but you seem to be thinking that this is something that's going to get better over the next few quarters. ", ["Yes. I mean so I think, and it may be - look, I think these trends tend to be relatively market specific. And while I think more companies are talking about it today, I think we were probably one of the earliest companies to really highlight this issue back in the middle of 2015. And honestly it may be a function of being in markets that are faster growing than the national average and that recovered at least at a disproportionately more aggressive pace than the national metrics would suggest, places like Vegas and Southern California and South Florida, et cetera. So I think we have a point of view that's informed by our previous experience with labor shortages that two things happened during labor shortages. One, on a macro basis the market tends to adjust for the labor shortages. More nurses enroll in nursing school, part time nurses take on more hours, retired nurses come back and work extra shifts because wage rates are going up and there's an attractive sort of economic equation for them. So I think we see that happening at a macro level in our markets.\nBut the other issue I think is that because we've been facing this issue now for I think almost two years, and we've been focused on it and we've been addressing it, I think we\u2019re finding that we're making internal improvements in our own markets, both at the rate that we're recruiting mostly nurses but other clinicians as well, and also the impact they were having on the retention of those that we recruit by implementing aggressive mentoring programs and career development programs and providing incentives for our employees, again most notably nurses who come to work for us to really want to stay in our organization and build their careers with us."]], ["The company specific side of it because I think for the last year or two, you kind of talk mostly about how things normally work out over time, and there hasn't been as many clear cut things. ", ["Yes. I mean so I guess a couple of things. I mean I think again on the acute side of the business, I think that the way that the labor shortage was manifested primarily was through margin pressures, that even though our revenues and volumes were quite robust and have been quite robust for the last few years, I think our acute care margins haven't always been where we would have expected them to be, given those revenue growth rates. And I think it's because of those wage pressures. I think that the acute margins have been improving and that's the ultimate. I can give you other statistics about the things you asked about, retention and recruitment rates, et cetera. But in my mind, the proof is in the pudding and it's the margin improvement over time that's really demonstrating our improvement there.\nOn the behavioral side, I think the labor shortage manifested itself in weaker volumes. And for the most part, I think volumes have been, particularly admissions have been increasing for the last year or so. Now Q3 was a bit of a hiccup, but I think that was impacted by a bunch of different things, including the hurricanes, et cetera. But I think generally, we feel like we've continued on this trajectory for the last four or five quarters of improving our volumes on the behavioral side. And again in my mind, that's the proof in the pudding that we're improving that labor situation and filling the vacancies."]], ["And Steve, if I could just on a different topic, as you're looking at the - all the headlines on the ACA exchange enrolment and in light of Anthem\u2019s announcement yesterday of pretty broad, not complete but pretty broad exit from exchanges, how are you thinking about that directionally in terms of impact on your plan for 2018? ", ["Yes. Look, it's difficult for us, Matt to be terribly proactive in this regard, in the sense that we really don't know in our individual markets what the level of enrollment is in the exchanges or disenrollment, et cetera. So it's a little hard for us to react in advance. Generally we have the view that in virtually all of our markets, there remain viable commercial exchange choices for those who want to enroll. And so that is helpful. I think in terms of network participation, again with very rare exceptions, we are network providers in virtually every network in every one of our markets. So I think we're already well positioned. If there is movement amongst products or amongst companies to be able to benefit from that. so I think at one level, we're just going to have to wait and see from a macro basis what level of disenrollment there is in the exchanges come next year. But I mean in terms of being in all the networks, I don't think we could really do that any more extensively than we currently do."]], ["Steve, I was hoping you could give us some detail on the bed expansion schedule over there, what will be coming on in the fourth quarter and what you're assuming for next year. ", ["Sure. So I think I'll do it in reverse order. The court ordered issue is old litigation in one of our south Texas facilities literally that goes back 15 or 16 years. A court order came through in the last few months requiring us to make the payment that we disclosed in the quarterly release. We\u2019re appealing that payment and hope to either have it reversed or substantially reduced. But because it was so old and didn't seem terribly relevant to our current operations, we recorded that item in the other segment, not in either of the two operating segments.\nAs far as, I think you were alluding to the behavioral drags, specifically I think I mentioned this again in answer maybe to Justin's original question on the call.

But we're generally keeping our expense structure in place in the hopes that we're going to rectify this relatively soon and will be able to get back to relatively normal operations.\nSo I think what I was saying in response to Justin earlier was that we assume that the drag from those facilities that we experienced in quarter three, would be fairly similar in Q4, but that as we entered into 2018, we would either rectify the revenue side of this and essentially get back to where we were. Or we would have to right size the facilities and adjust our expenses to a lower, a more permanent sort of revenue reduction. So we'll deal with that, but at least in Q4, the assumption was as we continue to work with the regulators in the States in those markets, it will be the same magnitude of result.\nAlan Miller\nAnd then I think your bed expansion question, which was your first question, we will - it's not always the most ratable sort of thing, but I think we've been adding beds at a pace of about six or 800 beds a year on the behavioral side. That\u2019s certainly been our target, and I think that has not changed for us, and we would expect something along those lines in 2018 as well."]], ["And then secondly, in terms of any other drags on the business end, on the behavioral side of the business, I know there were some issues at a couple of facilities, but any assumption about that continued drag as it relates to guidance for the fourth quarter?

", ["Yes. I don't think that's really changed, Ana. I mean again, I think from the original guidance back at the beginning of the year, the original guidance sort of was premised on the idea that we could get to that sort of 5% targeted same store revenue growth rate in behavioral by the end of 2017. And I think we really changed that view at the end of the second quarter to say now this was now more of a first half 2018 issue, either Q1 or Q2. Again, I think given some of the challenges in Q3, I guess I would conservatively say it's probably now more a Q2 of \u201818 issue. But I think it's all really from our perspective, just elongating the timeframe on an incremental basis rather than changing any sort of fundamental view we have about what the real underlying metrics of the business are."]], ["Has this been kind of a one-time thing because of the IMD exclusion and it then subsides and you kind - your comps get easier so next year you\u2019ll have a flattish number?

So I think there is quite frankly almost by definition, a limited amount of downside in terms of how much the length of stay can be reduced without really impacting the clinical outcomes and the quality of care for these patients. That\u2019s number one. Number two is I think, because we're now focused on this issue, I think we're just doing a better job of really documenting the clinical needs of these patients and the need, where appropriate, for them to stay longer where that\u2019s clinically appropriate, et cetera. So I think it's a combination of kind of a natural floor on this issue, as well as our just doing a better job representing the interests of our patients and our clinicians."]], ["And as far as - so given that you\u2019re seeing it's a natural floor, do you think you would still need to invoke mental health parity or any other kind of legal routes to pressure them, not necessarily in court?

And obviously that's the last sort of resort that we would try and avoid. But again, I think that we're going to pursue what we think is best for our patients and what our clinicians advise us is best for our patients to whatever degree we have to. And again, I think we would hope that in most cases, that can be mutually agreed upon with the payer, but if we need to be more aggressive, we'll do that as well."]], ["And I know the message has sort of been, doesn't make a whole lot of sense to pay down a lot of debt here and we're going to get more aggressive on buybacks, but it doesn't seem like you're getting terribly more aggressive.

We don't want them to be any lower. We\u2019ll continue to be I think an active acquirer of our shares at these levels. We do try and balance that and manage that against any other external opportunities that may arise. There are not always easy to forecast or predict in a precise way. So there is a bit of a struggle to manage that, but I think otherwise everything else you said about leverage and about the attractiveness of repurchasing our own shares remains true."]], ["Just I don't know, maybe just a frame of how you're thinking about the businesses generically next year, just to give us a little bit of help in framing up where we should be for 2018.

But I think I have mentioned already previously in this call, as well as at other times. Our general sense of the trajectory of the two businesses, we kind of believe that the behavioral business will sort of get back to what we would sort of describe as kind of a normalized 5% same store revenue growth rate sometime in the middle of 2018. We think that the acutes, which have been running pretty consistently, at least at the 5% to 6% range, will continue to do so into \u201918. So you can sort of I think presume the EBITDA growth that goes along with that.\nIn terms of some of the pushes and pulls that go along with that, some of the special reimbursement items are still difficult to project. We\u2019ll certainly be able to give more precise guidance on that sort of - on those sort of issues as we get closer and as we give our formal guidance.

So I mean I think what we said when this - we first started discussing this problem, which as I mentioned earlier was probably a good two years ago, we. were careful to note that this was really a market specific issue, that there were a half a dozen markets that were particularly difficult for us, maybe 20 some odd facilities. The reason that we don't necessarily sort of give these closed beds numbers or percentages of beds that are closed, et cetera is because I think those who follow the industry like to think of this as sort of a static issue, that there's kind of a number of closed beds at the outset and then you just continue to work that number down. I mean the reality, as you might imagine is, it's a fluid sort of issue and a facility that had a problem is able to solve its problem, but then another facility comes into it.\nWhat I said I think in response to an earlier question is, ultimately the way we've measured our progress, particularly on the behavioral side of this, is the continued growth in admissions over the last year or so. The labor shortage was a problem that manifested itself on the behavioral side ultimately and originally through a pretty dramatic decline in admission growth. And I think in our minds, the way that we're able to convince ourselves that we're ultimately solving that problem is through the recovery of admission growth and the rebound in admission growth. And even though as somebody asked before, we certainly track a lot of other metrics like vacancies and turnover and number of nurses in training and orientation. Ultimately the proof in the pudding is, are we able to open these beds and are we able to increase admissions? And we feel like for the most part, we've been able to do that, albeit in an incremental way. The progress has been slow, but we've been able to do it pretty slowly and steadily for the last year or so."]], ["Then I guess, stepping back, if I look at the results, it looks like maybe a little bit of puts and takes in acute, but I would characterize that as largely in line with expectations, maybe a little bit ahead, and that to the extent there was any variance, it was mainly on the behavioral side.

The 2.2% revenue growth, even when you adjust that for the negative currency swing between years, I think that number becomes something like closer to 2.75% same-store revenue growth on the behavioral side, and that's still a little bit lower than where we expect it to be at this time of the year. We probably expect it to be closer to something like 3.5% and I think you've identified the variance as the length of stay, I mean, that admission growth number which I think now has grown for four consecutive quarters, is really well within, and, frankly, probably a little bit ahead of our expectations and I think is reflective of what we have been saying all along, that the underlying demand for our behavioral services across the portfolio remains strong, but the length of stay decline that we've experienced in Q1 and Q2 is not something we anticipated when we gave our original guidance.\nI think most of the commentary that I would make on that length of stay contraction is similar to what I said in Q1, and that is that I think it's a result of really two dynamics; one is that we are seeing more Medicaid patients who tend to have a lower length of stay than the rest of our payers. We believe that probably the impetus for that increase in Medicaid utilization is the benefit of the IMD exclusion being lifted, and \u2013 but I think one of the things that's happening in the short run is, there is some adverse payer mix selection, and that increase in Medicaid patients is crowding out some of the Medicare and commercial patients who, in many cases, are probably better-paying patients, and also those with higher length of stay.\nThe other issue, I think, that we talked about, and I think you were sort of alluding to in your question is that within the Medicaid payer mix in that patient population, we're seeing some more aggressive behavior on the part of payers.

I think on the acute side, we continue to run higher than what we would consider to be ideal levels of premium pay that is over-time and use of temporary nurses, in particular.\nI think our general sense over, again, the course of the year in our guidance was that those pressures would become more muted in the back-half of the year when the comparisons became easier, and that's still our expectation."]], ["The question \u2013 the first question I had was, while your \u2013 the provision for that flip-downs look relatively stable, the charity and uninsured discounts, as a percentage of revenue trended up quite meaningfully.

We always say that we really, internally, focus entirely on sort of, the cash net revenue per admission or net revenue per day depending on which division we're looking at, as opposed to individual shifts between charity care and uninsured discount and bad debt expense, which we acknowledge, fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, and which we struggle with explaining.\nI think on the acute side, as I already discussed in response to, I think, it was Jason's earlier question, revenue per admission was relatively flat in the quarter. I think that had more to do with mix of patients and lower acuity patients than it did with payer mix, although, I did acknowledge, as many of our peers have talked about over the last several quarters, that we continue to see an uptick in uncompensated patients and a downturn in commercial patients, particularly commercial exchange patients. Those phenomena, however, I think have been present for at least the last six maybe even eight quarters."]], ["I guess how much \u2013 you sort of alluded to this, you can get to the 5% target just if you get the admissions growth to a high enough level; but I mean, what is your level of confidence that you guys can sort of affect stabilization and the length of stay versus just the payers backing off a little bit? ", ["Look. I think that this is a push and pull sort of dynamic, the payers are always pressuring providers for, in our minds, the lowest possible length of stay and again, the ultimate decision, I think, comes down to a question of clinical appropriateness and certainly on our end, that's being made by a treating psychiatrist. We hope that on the payer end, it's also being made by someone with a clinical background who has the best interest of the patient at heart as well.\nIt's difficult for me to predict. Obviously, we suggested, or I suggested at the end of Q1 that we would hope to be able potentially to impact length of stay in Q2 if it was clinically appropriate and that really didn't happen. So again, the only point that I'll make is, I think we believe we can get to our revenue guidance number; even if we don't get to it by the end of 2017, we can get to it early in 2018 through some combination of a continued increase in admissions and potentially a stabilizing length of stay number."]], ["Okay and if I could just slip one more in; on the acute care side, could you give us a sense for what type of revenue growth you're expecting for the second half of the year? ", ["Yeah, so again, our original guidance on the acute care side was 5% to 6% revenue growth for the year, and as I said earlier, kind of split pretty evenly between price and volumes. At least, that was our original assumption.\nThe notion always was, that would be a sort of increasing trajectory as the year went on because the first half of the year comparisons from a revenue perspective were quite difficult, and the comparisons in the second half of the year were markedly easier. And again, I think that remains our projections. I think the acute care performance, as in an earlier question, suggests it was very much in line; and our guidance, and our guidance both from a revenue and an EBITDA perspective, remain the same for the back half of the year."]], ["That's helpful and then Steve, the \u2013 my impression is that the \u2013 from a cadence perspective, the behavioral business, I think, you've been saying publicly in those same conferences that behavioral \u2013 this ramp in behavioral revenue looks like it was on track for most of the quarter.

It looks to me like July has bounced back some.\nI mean, I think if you step back, and again, I'm just going to return to sort of the cadence that I talked about, and I think Whit was sort of suggesting in his comments, the admission growth in particular has been on an upswing for the last four quarters and that translates to revenue growth being on that same upswing. And I think we believe that both of those trends are going to continue, albeit probably a little bit more slowly than our initial 2017 guidance implied."]], ["It sounds like it must have turned down in June relative to April and May; can you tell us what happened there specifically, and then given it did turn down so late in the quarter, if there's anything you could share with us in terms of how July is looking relative to June, that would be really helpful.

I think we take the point of view that we have seen our Medicaid utilization increase since the IMD exclusion was lifted, and we make sort of, a default kind of \u2013 or we reached a sort of a default kind of conclusion that the increase in Medicaid utilization is a result largely of the IMD exclusion being lifted, but it's difficult, with any precision, to sort of identify the precise number of patients who really are at our hospitals, are eligible to be admitted to our hospitals because of the IMD exclusion, and I apologize..."]], ["So I guess if you adjust for those two things for the leap year and the exchange rate, so maybe your kind of say, core sort of same-store revenue growth was maybe 3%, 3.5%.

I think we started to see improvement in our behavioral volumes and consequently, revenues in the back half of 2016. I think admission growth continued to improve into the first quarter, and we continue to adhere to our guidance, which is that we anticipate exiting 2017 at about a 5%, 5.5% same-store revenue growth rate in behavioral which would restore us to sort of where we were right around the middle of 2015 when we started to suffer from labor shortages, both physicians and nurses in a number of our hospitals."]], ["So what I'm getting at, and the main question that I have here is last quarter you kind of talked about your expectations for that business to come back to a 5% call it, same-store revenue growth by the end of the year.

", ["I mean, I think the fundamental issue, Chris, and I think we've been pretty candid about this for a bit now, is that with same-store revenue growth of 1.5%, it is extremely difficult to have, I think in any sort of practical expectation of an expanding margin. We think we need to get to probably 3% or 4% same-store revenue growth to even begin to sort of have the possibility of expanding margins. And if we exit the year as our guidance suggests that we will at 5%, 5.5% revenue growth, then we believe, we will return to a model where we'd have expanding margins. But I think the reason that you see contracting margins currently is simply because our current revenue growth is not sufficient to support the increase in expenses.\nAnd I think we talked about this in the last quarter or 2, the current expense load does incorporate some investment in solving the labor shortage problem. Meaning, in wage increases in certain markets that we've had to make to be competitive as well as temporary use of, or use of temporary nurses and temporary physicians, so there's some amount of what I would call extra or excessive expense as well. So until we get that same-store revenue growth up to a somewhat higher level than we are today, I think we're going to be faced with these relatively stagnant or even declining margins."]], ["And in the past, I think you've talked about making good progress being maybe like a quarter or a third of the way there, and with the goal of reopening all of the closed beds by the end of the year. ", ["Yes. I mean, I appreciate the question, Sarah. I think as I was saying to Chris, we absolutely have reopened a number of units where we had closed beds. We've uncapped census in a number of facilities where we had previously capped census. And I think again as I was addressing Chris, on a net basis, I think we have less closed beds or uncapped census today than we did six months ago or nine months ago.\nBut to be fair, I think we still have some places where we are still suffering from a lack of clinicians, whether they'd be nurses or psychiatrists. And we continue to address those as we go forward, look, I'm a financial guy, who's very objective, and I just continue to point to the admission data as really the proof in the pudding here rather than any sort of labor metric that to me, the proof that we're making net progress is that our admissions are growing incrementally each quarter for the last three quarters."]], ["For the ones that you're kind of stepping into like a Baylor or Providence, their large systems, how do you think about the time line to when you can start to have those conversations about expanding system wide?

So I think that we've already demonstrated a level of expertise and competence that has given them confidence to do further deals with us, further joint ventures. There is no sort of prescribed time line in our arrangements or in our contracts.\nI think this is as you might expect with any sort of a vendor, the notion of gaining confidence from the company that you're serving, and hoping that in doing so, they'll allow you more opportunity and more responsibility. And again, I think we've demonstrated that in the case of both Baylor and Providence, and I think we'll, we hope to continue to do that with lots of other hospitals and hospital systems around the country."]], ["I wonder, as you've drilled down, obviously, there's been some adverse publicity around the site business -- are you seeing any impact at all from that, that you can discern of maybe the facilities that have already been discussed?

There's really nothing new there. As far as your other question about have we really seen an impact on the underlying business since then, I think the most recent negative publicity began in early December, I think we've said a number of times, we've said it on the year-end call, and I'll just reiterate it today, I think the answer to that is no.\nWe really see no response from our referral sources of any measurable note. We've seen no response from our own clinicians and a change in their behavior. Honestly, the single biggest reaction, external reaction that we've gotten to that and to the media reporting has been from the investor community, not from clinicians themselves.\nI think clinicians have tended to discount that reporting as being largely anecdotal and not an accurate depiction of what it is really like to run a behavioral hospital in the U.S. So no, I mean the short answer to your question is no. And again, I'm just going to go back and say Q1 is the first full quarter we had since these articles started to appear, and our admission growth actually ticked up in the quarter."]], ["And a big part of that in my mind, I've been covering the stock for pushing 20 years now, is how disciplined and thoughtful you've been on capital deployment, whether it was the original site facility buys, the PSY deal, and also, aggressively buying back your stock, even going as far as doing big ASRs and levering up to do them.\nSo with 2 times leverage and a free cash flow, this 6%, 7%, probably the biggest question I get is how you deploy capital from here? ", ["I think that I'll reiterate that we are opportunistic. We've been in a fortunate position that we've been consistent with earnings, and we certainly have a big bank line and all the capital that we would need in the foreseeable future. So whatever is opportunistic for us, we take advantage of. Steve talked about difficulty in buying our shares in the first quarter. We think our shares, and I think the Street usually thinks that they're good values just not undervalue, but we're always looking at deployment of our capital, where we think we can do well with it.\nWe're very excited about the 2 new hospitals that we built in acute care. We're excited about our acquisition in the U.K. our latest acquisition. We've got to work our way through it, obviously. But we're excited about all of those. So depending on what appears to us opportunistically in good returns, that's what we follow. So just to reiterate, we can buy stock, we can buy a company or a small company. We can build a hospital or a number of hospitals. So we have all of those avenues open to us."]], ["The slide say the length of stay declined, I think the question has been asked about that the revenue per patient day and the mix shifting to Medicaid, I'm assuming, is a piece of it. ", ["So I think we have talked about pricing, sustainable pricing in the behavioral division to be in the kind of 1% to 2% range. So when we talk about hoping to exit the year at 5%, 5.5% volume growth in behavioral, which is sort of getting us back to where we were before the labor shortage began, we're really thinking of that being composed of 3% to 4% volume and 1% to 2% price.\nIf you look at our pricing for the quarter, our revenue per patient day, per adjusted patient day is right in that 1.5% range, particularly if you adjust for the currency fluctuation. So I think from a pricing perspective, we've been where we think we're going to be and we were in the first quarter. So I think on the behavioral side, the outstanding variable remains volume. And what will be required for us to get from where we are today to where we hope to be at the end of the year is an increase in volume."]], ["Second, I know you've gotten a way from talking about your exposure, but I think it's relatively modest you perceive to some of the changes that are being made, but any updated thoughts on -- of the acute and behavioral and what your exposure might be to some changes?

And that's really what I think has increased and made more robust behavioral coverage around the country.

Your last question, I think about the industry suggesting regulatory changes, first of all, I think we would largely do that through our industry organization.\nBut I think the second part of that is maybe why our lobbying organization has been not quite so aggressive about that is because they're really fighting the, what I think the big battle is at the moment, which is ACA repeal.

Now, let me turn it over to Peter to give some more details in terms of margins stand.\nPeter O'Donnell\nYes. Thanks Humphrey. Maybe be I'll just a step back and sort of give my view where the business is. So, yes, we have experienced a challenging environment recently with the significant uncertainty around Brexit. And as you guys mentioned it, interest rate and the exchange rate, I would say, are sort of most visible indicator of that with interest rate down below 10-year, down below 1%, and the exchange rate being under $1.30 for most of the year. Good news, it's not a $1.30 since it's pretty stable around that.\nVery positive about the election results in December, it's really good. I think for business in the UK, we spoke to most business leaders they want to see a stable government for at least 5 years. However in 2020, we expect the external environment to be very similar to 2019, as the UK debates its future relationship with EU.\nAs Steve mentioned in his remarks, I feel good about the focus we're making in many areas. We've seen good growth in products that are sensitive to interest rates, good expense, good core growth, and persistency is being good given the renewal program. However, it's on our long-term visibility product, we have seen the most pressure, both from interest rate and higher claims incidents and severity, moving away from a long-term averages. But we've been responding to again over the last two years with our rate program, which will restore margin and we are being very disciplined on pricing of business.\nWe do see volatility by quarter, and in 2018 we've averaged around 20 million, higher in the first half and lower in second half. I wouldn't worry too much about that trend in the second half. It does tend us to move around a lot. But basically, we landed about 80 million for the year; and as Rick mentioned, an ROE of just under 14%.\nIn 2020, we will continue to rerate the book and work on clients to improve claims and grow those non-interest rate sensitive products. And we expect BTOE to be broadly in line with 2019, but it can move around that $20 million NIM by quarter. It's difficult to call it by quarter.

We see that as a very attractive business for us over time and one of our biggest areas of the investment.\nSo, the overall profile of the Company that Rick was talking about, we're going to continue drive efficiencies at the macro level and that is one primary place that we're reinvesting funds back into this business. We see that as a real problem that we can solve for clients in a differentiated way. And so as we do that in the segment, as you're computing kind of an OE ratio with premium as your denominator and fee-based business are going to continue to see that OE ratio continue to drift off.\nBut I would tell you that, if you pull the fee-based businesses out of the segment, we actually saw about 50 basis points decline in the traditional operating expense ratio there. So, in some ways, you kind of look out for that segment, I would continue to expect some modest growth in that expense ratio because of the growth in fee, but you should know that underneath that, we're continuing to sort of drive efficiency on the insurance side."]], ["Want to follow up on Jimmy's question a little bit earlier about the flat sales at Colonial and I think also in Unum US there were some pressures, I think group long-term disability was off about 6%.

I think it's both.

If you recall, when we went through tax reform that had a pretty dramatic impact on the level of required capital we had down in our insurance.\nBut it was really just the stroke of the pen of change in the tax rate and how that change the RBC factors. So that created more contributions down of the subs than we had historically seen. The other thing is we did have our reserve charge last year there was a disabled life reserve impact of that, which drove some statutory capital requirement.\nSo I would say the last two years have been a bit of anomaly. I'd say that we're going to be able to navigate through this year. We do view that to be kind of a decreasing call on capital and call on cash at the holding company as we go forward.

", ["Yes, this is Steve. Thanks for question, Alex and I think there is a couple of things to think about first Unum is under kind of a traditional strict cash flow testing regime and within the New York interpretations of that, there is a couple of things that are, we believe are much more conservative than really the economics of the business. One is that they don't allow you to build into kind of your future cash flow unapproved rate increases.\nAnd as you know, that's a pretty big part of how we think about the economics of the business going forward that there are rate increases, going forward that we think we will get approved and be able to factor into the profitability, New York doesn\u2019t allow you on that New York business to incorporate that.\nI would say the other thing is they cap credit spreads, not just on your new money portfolio going forward, but they look at your existing portfolio and almost cap the yields on what you're able to factor in the economics when you do your cash flow testing and so that obviously decreases the yield, we're able to use for that evaluation and then I'd say the other thing, something I mentioned earlier for new money, they use more of a spot yield, where the best estimate perspective, we think it more as a reversion of the mean.\nAnd we talked about in our best estimate we have a 5.5% that increases over time up to 6% in a quarter for Unum cash flow testing that would be a spot rate of where we are right now.\nSo those three things just in the methodology build a much more conservative view in how we do our asset adequacy testing. I would say generally when you think about the business itself and really differences there we had a little bit more maybe individual business in New York, but by and large, it's the same type of business, same type of policy construct. So I think it's more than methodology."]], ["But I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about your current recruiting outlook as well as any other additional factors that may effect the sales growth in the quarter? ", ["Humphrey, we've got Tim Arnold here. Tim, do you want to take that?\nTimothy Arnold\nSure. Yes. Thank you, Humphrey, for the question. There were a few factors that contribute to the sales challenges that we had in the quarter. But before I get those, I know we have 1 or 2 people who are maybe new on this call, and just as a quick reminder, over the last 22 quarters, Colonial Life's average growth rate in sales has been a little bit north of 8% in an industry that's growing 3% to 4%. So a long track record of very, very strong growth. In the quarter, we did experience pressure from some recruiting shortfalls we've seen over the last few quarters beginning in the second half of 2018. We attribute that to a couple of things. First, the very strong growth that we had in 2018 caused our sales team to be very busy, producing sales, helping implement new customers and rolling significant amount of new business. I think that took a little bit of focus away from recruiting when such very strong sales activity was occurring.\nAnd then the second is, in this economy with incredibly low unemployment rates, recruiting can be a challenge. We do expect that recruiting to swing back in the second half of the year. We've made some changes in the way we recruit people and the way we on-board them, and so we do expect that to swing back up. Our a rep -- new rep production is actually not down as much as the recruiting would suggest. So while recruiting is lower, we are seeing somewhat improved productivity on the people that we are bringing on. The environment is still very competitive, especially in large case, and so we see that showing up as pressure a bit. You and Steve both mentioned the challenging comparable from last year. We launched our new dental product on March 25 of last year, that fueled extremely strong growth in the second, third quarters of last year at 13.5% in the second quarter and 13% in the third quarter. And then finally, I would say, in the quarter, we made the decision to restructure and terminate a very small number of high-volume brokerage relationships where the kind of business that we're getting from certain brokers had very low quality, low persistency, and where brokers perhaps valued compensation more than they valued a good strong customer experience and value to the customer. And so that created some headwinds for us as well.\nIn terms of the outlook, it's going to be a challenge, but our team is highly motivated to do everything we possibly can to try to get to the bottom end of the range, but it will be an uphill battle. The good news is that we feel good about the pipeline we have, including in large case right now. And as a reminder, 40% of our annual sales occur in the fourth quarter. So while it's going to be a pretty steep hill to climb, there are some opportunities for us to close the gap."]], ["I guess, maybe at a high level, can you talk about what kind of opportunities you're looking at and in terms of kind of on a P&L impact because I thought that the leave management was more of a service as opposed to an earnings generator, but maybe I was wrong? ", ["Sure. I think it's a good question, Humphrey, because leave services is very important to our business, and we've been a leader in that space and been doing it for several years. And I think you're right, it's not in and of itself an earnings generator, but it's an important part of the package as we go and talk to customers that they value those services very much. We do an excellent job at that and had for a long time, and I think we're well known to provide that service very well. So it'll be part of the package. It's part of the reason why you see good core growth across our broad package that we have out there today. You mentioned it can skew the expense ratio a little bit given the fact that those are kind of just expenses that get added on and really get reflected in the margins that we see otherwise. So it's a very good business for us. We're continuing to invest in it. We think it's a real help to the overall value proposition that we bring to our customers. It's widely talked about in the market today, and we think we do a great job of serving our customers, and we look that to help us as part of our overall growth trajectory. Mike, do you want to add anything?\nMichael Simonds\nYes. Just a couple of quick things, Rick. Humphrey, we find that in the group disability segment, the fees that we charge for that business it's not a risk-bearing product, so the expenses plus a small margin gets you to your fees charged. Rick, I think, nailed it really well. And you know just the one thing I would point to is every time that you read about another state or another municipality passing some sort of paid or protected leave law, that means complexity for employers. And so I'd say we're seeing with increasing frequency employers looking to outsource the compliance and the employee experience around those paid and protected leave. It's a complex business, but it's a really good opportunity for us to embed value. And when you look at the growth and the accelerating momentum in our short-term and long-term disability lines, a good amount of that you can attribute back to the strength of the leave offering."]], ["I know they got pushed back a year, but just would be interested to hear any kind of update in terms of the way you're thinking about the impact, the timing and when you might be able to shed more light on that, if you're not able to today? ", ["Yes. So I'll take the LDTI update first. So just to reground on that accounting change for how we handle reserving on our policies for mostly our long-duration contracts. Right now, the interpretation, as we would read, it would say they're probably the active life reserves, which is about 40% of our overall reserve level. And really for us the biggest change is going to be around the discount rate where we're going -- we'll need to go to more of a single A type rate, which doesn't really match up with a lot of our portfolios. We view it as noneconomic. It's not going to impact our statutory cash flows. So overall, feel good about that. So what has happened is there was a preliminary vote to delay and it has been recommended to delay the implementation for a year to 1/1/2022. That is pending a 30-day comment period and then there will be a final vote on that.\nSo we shouldn't have a kind of final recommendation or, I guess, final vote in the coming month. I'll tell you, we can't really speak yet to the timing of when our evaluation is going to be done because what we believe there's still some important interpretations that need to be made before we really truly understand the scope of the new guidance and are able to evaluate that. So we're really not trying to give any kind of update on when we might be able to give the results of our evaluation. What I'll say is we feel good about the process. There's a lot of process changes that need to be put into play with our evaluation systems. We're making great progress against that. So we feel good about the process, and clearly we're happy that they're going to delay it a year, it will give us that much longer to really work through it and work through the analytics on that. On the leverage side, yes, you're correct. Our leverage went up a couple of percentage points and that was due to the issuance we had in June of the $400 million 10-year note. That is earmarked for the prefunding of our maturity next September. And so we would do that leverage staying at the current rate really until we get through that prefunding. I think we'd want to manage that down over time though."]], ["But when we had the new tax legislation at the beginning of 2018, I think, across-the-board companies were saying they're going to have to give back some of that pricing to the consumers. ", ["Yes. So maybe I'll start off just on the overall pricing environment and talk a little bit about tax reform and how that has worked its way back into pricing. And I think our view on that and at the time when it was going in, we looked at that and said, it may, but it will take some time, and we'll see how it does. The more we looked at it, I think it's less of a factor. When you think about the tax rate impacts of the margins, what we see, our margins that we're getting today, which are above our competition, it's really not going to work its way back into pricing. Just the sheer level of 10% difference in a federal tax rate relative to our pricing is an immaterial input to that process. So we don't see it because of that.

And as they weighed into it, it's not necessarily price. Prices are pretty standard to the end consumer in terms of what they see there but there are ways they can package it, ways they work with, carriers will work with customers, meaning the employer to entice them into that type of thing. Tim talked a little bit about that in his comments in Colonial Life, but I think that's true in the voluntary market. So there's more competition there.

", ["Yes. I guess, I'll look at that just to go back to the process we take to file rate increases. It's a very long-term view of both our liability assumptions as well as interest rates. So if you go back to how we were looking at it when we did our reserve assumption adjustment back in September, that would've been the basis for our rate increase request. So -- and we take a consistent approach nationwide to that. So we would have reset the assumptions set. We would have factored that into rate increase requests, and then we filed those new ones through the last part of last year into the first part of this year. And again, we still feel good about our long-term view of interest rates and they'll feel like we need to reset those at this time. And so we wouldn't adjust those for the rate increase request as well. And just the timing, that varies quite a bit. Some states -- we've have some states that have approved the increases that we filed the latter part of last year and the first part of this year. They are approved, and we'll be implementing those and then there's other states that it takes longer and it may take even several years. They also may face those in over time. So the timing can vary quite a bit. But we factor that all in to how we think about the value that we can get from those."]], ["I think it's the way profits before losses accounting works, sometimes the premiums, they come in from a premium rate increase are necessarily used to build reserves the way your typical premiums would. ", ["Yes. I would say you'd get different answers depending on the accounting basis. So when you look at GAAP accounting, we factored those increases into our reserve assumptions. So there is a point where those reserves assume that you're getting the increased premium. Now the timing of that may not always match up perfectly because there is an assumption of the timing of implementation. But by and large, over time, those premiums are anticipated by the reserve itself. So there's less of that, that will fall through. On a statutory basis, your statutory reserves kind of work independent of the actual premium collected. It's -- those are kind of more locked in assumptions, and so more of that may fall through to the bottom line.\nRichard McKenney\nThanks, Alex.

Thanks, very much."]], ["Looking at Unum US supplemental and voluntary as well as Colonial Life, premium growth was good, 5%, but probably a little lighter than what you have been having and then also kind of relative to your guidance. ", ["We will start in the U.S., Michael, and head over to Tim in [indiscernible].\nMichael Simonds\nHumphrey, and yes, you did -- I'm going to start with dental. You cited a tough comp because we made the decision to exit a relatively small direct-to-consumer business. We're focused entirely on the worksite [indiscernible] unique about Unum here in the U.S. Then still, we don't have the individual sales for dental in the current quarter number to compare to. So if you kind of peel that back and look at what we're taking forward, which is the group dental and vision business, we saw sales growth over 45% in the quarter so really strong and I'd say exciting momentum building for group dental and group vision going forward, and we anticipate -- liked we talked at the outlook day that, that'll be a meaningful contributor to our overall Unum US, not just something involved but overall Unum US sales results here in 2019 and a pretty significant premium contributor in 2020.\nSo feel very good about that. On the voluntary benefits front, I guess, what was the primary dampener on premium growth was we did see a poor quarter from VB persistencies. So we reported 73% versus 77% a year ago 1Q. That's a tough comparable. 77% is at the high end of what we've seen historically, which is in the 75% to 77% range. As we dig into it, I'd say it's an average case size issue, so if you took the relatively comparable number of terms and you applied historical averages for the average size of the term, that's worth about 2 points and that puts us into the bottom edge of the range. So I wouldn't say it's as bad as it looks, but I would highlight the large case voluntary benefits market as one that is competitive. We've seen some existing competitors get more aggressive there. We've seen some new entrants. And hopefully you've come to know and expect of us is we're going to be disciplined about our approach there in terms of our underwriting and our expense profile. So I do remain optimistic in the long term about voluntary benefits. But in that large-case market, I think there's probably a little bit of weathering that we're going to have to do.\nRichard McKenney\nGood. Tim, you want to hit Colonial Life?\nTimothy Arnold\nYes. Humphrey, thank you for the question. I'll start with the overall level of premium and persistency, and we are seeing some of the same trends that Mike talk about. Our persistency this year was lighter than last year and a little lighter than our plan, and a big part of that is the large case component. And we do see some seasonality and volatility there. The first quarter typically has the largest percentage of clients who had their medical client renewals, and so much of their voluntary benefits also up for renewal in the first quarter, and so we see some volatility there. From a sales perspective, this is the 22nd consecutive quarter that Colonial Life has producing year-over-year growth in sales. So we feel good about the sales results overall, a little bit lighter than we had projected, but we saw very strong growth in our core commercial market, in the Public Sector market and from 3 of our 4 sales regions. There was pressure in large case there from a sales perspective as well, which that large-case market can be a little bit more volatile. I will just remind everyone that first quarter for Colonial Life is typically our lowest sales volume quarter of the year. So we feel good about our prospects of recovering from a little bit of a shortfall here."]], ["And some of the commentary we've heard from, I guess, peers and reinsurers and so forth, it's suggested that maybe RBC isn't the best measure of capital adequacy as it relates to LTC specifically. ", ["Yes. So, my response to that is we look at capital adequacy of the company, not at a single line. There are lines like maybe the LTC, the RBC. Ratios don't reflect the risk in long-term care, but I'll guarantee you those same RBC ratios are way overstated for the things like Colonial Life's business. They don't reflect or overstate the capital needs of the group businesses, which are way less volatile than that -- those ratios would assume. And even within long-term care, so a piece of the RBC ratio is that premium. But you're also holding risk-based capital in the reserves. You're holding risk-based capital on the assets underlying the long-term care business. So I -- so we look at it in an aggregate basis. When we look at economic capital, it reflects the fact that we are a very profitable company that we generate a lot of free cash flow, and we feel more than adequately capitalized at our current levels."]], ["Can you talk a bit about whether we should -- is there any reason I think that's not sustainable based on the trends you're seeing, meaning like was there any favorable prior year development? ", ["Mike?\nUnidentified Company Representative\nSure. Thanks for the question, Thomas. As you said, favorable quarter from group disability point of view. And to your question about drivers, I'd say, it's encouraging in that the drivers are pretty widespread across LTC. Civilian incidents behaved and I would say that it is probably a little bit even move favorable than our expectations but not dramatically. So recoveries continue to be very good and right in line despite the favorable we've had. Good experience with Social Security offsets. Our settlement practices are right in line with expectations. So pretty much across the board, it's [indiscernible] a pretty good spot. It would only cost -- but it is insurance. So I wouldn't say anything is going to stick, exactly, but I wouldn't -- there's no reason to think that at the current level that we we're at, 74.7% is very reasonable and in the range. Also within group segment, group disability segment, in the short-term disability business, they don't actually say. We saw a little bit of the opposite in terms of the lack of favorability. And so that's something that we continue to watch pretty closely and are addressing through the normal renewal process. So that may be a little bit of a tailwind to the loss ratio over the next four quarters or so.\nJohn McGarry\nYes. Tom, the underlying fundamentals were good and pretty consistent, but I'd say it's never a good idea to take the best loss ratio you've ever had and assume it will last forever just as it's never a good idea to take the worst loss ratio you've ever had and assume it lasts forever. So I would say, a good quarter. We're glad it happened, but I think our kind of the old raw level of where the disability business has been running for the last several quarters is kind of a level I would peg it at."]], ["I was hoping you might be able to talk about a little bit what are the competitive tools, maybe technologies that can make a winner in the supplemental marketplace over the next five years, let's call it?

And so -- I think -- I couldn't speak to the entire set of weathers that are going to make for winners versus, I think, your term is nonwinners. But I could tell you what our strategy is, and that is to compete on the delivery of the benefits and particularly when we're talking about employee pay and voluntary, I think, what stands out over time is making life simple for the employer and for the end consumer. So our strategy is about investing, as I mentioned, and continuing to invest in integrating our product and process into the capital management, HR technologies that our clients are increasingly adopting. And they move to those cloud-based software. It gives you the ability to integrate really once and then carry that instance across because people stay on version when Software-as-a-Service. So we see that as a long-term trend where our focus on the benefits market and on that integration gives us a competitive advantage first. And then the second piece is -- and this is an important one for us, is increasingly integrating with our group insurance business because if you think about the things that drive a leave of absence or a disability, those are very often the same sicknesses, and accidents in health-related events that are going to trigger volatility benefits. And so we're seeing the majority of our growth coming when we integrate with the group insurance, and we see a pretty significantly uptick -- significant uptick in persistency on the voluntary side when it's integrated with group insurance. So that'll be the path which, I think, over time we're going to play to win.\nRichard McKenney\nYes, and I think, Josh, it's an important point you make that, over time, if you look to the history of it, this is the business that we're in. We invest heavily to make sure we have a lead in this business. It is a very good business. So it attracts competitors, nontraditional competitors that have come in over time, that haven't done this business. Oftentimes, they find out it's a little bit harder than they might think it is, and so we're able to work through. And whether these different periods of times of competition do so in a disciplined way and what you've seen, particularly in the group space, was some of those people end up selling because they don't have the scale. They don't have the capabilities. And it doesn't fit with their business model. Will that be what the future looks like? Hard to tell, but this will be the business that we're in.

", ["Great. Thank you, Josh. We will turn over to Mike to talk about the Unum U.S. position.\nMike Simonds\nThanks, Rick and good morning Josh. I think I started with the fact that all the prior companies heading into the consolidation we are calling on the same brokers and consultants and competing for the same employer groups in the market. So post consolidation I would say we see fewer players on any particular case, but players that are more concentrated and better able and I think more likely to use their scale to invest in capabilities as the basis of competition over a strong emphasis on just say pricing and underwriting. And I think I would see that as a positive in the long run for the industry\u2019s growth and return profile. To your question, I take you back to sort of the fundamentals of the industry where we see \u2013 we are seeing demand for what we do growing, then whether that\u2019s continued change in the health insurance landscape with bigger deductibles and more exposure for employees getting filled through voluntary products. We are increasing complexity when it comes to things like leave and disability and where we could come in and help solve for that complexity for employers. We are focused on those needs. We are disciplined player. We have got market leading positions. And so as you see fewer more concentrated in the basis of competition shifts more and more towards capability, I think that\u2019s very good news for us in the long run and for the industry. To your question on new entrants, I do see that some of those barriers to entry increasing not necessarily in terms of putting product on the street that remains pretty simple undertaking, but kind of amass the capabilities around the data, the technology and the expertise. I would say the bar is going up through this consolidation cycle. And then last I think you asked about tax reform..."]], ["I am wondering if that\u2019s more of a maybe a tough comparison on a year-over-year basis or if there is something that you would like to point out and if it changes any of your expectation as you think forward.

We had approximately 10.5% growth rate in sales and over 10% growth rate in our large case segment. Large case can be volatile for us. It\u2019s a very opportunistic market. We want to serve that marketplace, but we also want to make sure that we are seeing the same returns in the large case segment that we do in other places. Despite the tough overall comparison due to large case, we had a very good quarter in our direct part of the business. Our new case business in our below 500 life market, which were all up double-digits. So we are pleased with that. We feel great about our distribution system and our reach in the marketplace. Our product portfolio continues to resonate well in the marketplace with a full suite of both individual and group products. We have what we believe the very unique set of enrollment capabilities and services. Benefits education is increasingly important in the marketplace and we have over 7,000 benefits [indiscernible] who can help us with that. Our service delivery is second to none and it increasingly includes a full portfolio of digital solution.

The types of policy forms are consistent, kind of our pricing philosophy is relatively consistent as far as the types of risks. I\u2019d say where it\u2019s a little bit different just in the conversations with regulators. For the group policies, the \u2013 just absolute premiums are much lower just because of the relative benefits that are provided in those group policies. So, there\u2019s not as much maybe sticker shock on just the absolute premium amounts. I\u2019d say, the other thing is just the funding of the premiums themselves. Majority of our group business is employer funded, and so that creates a little bit different dynamic with the states, but I would say, by and large, the regulatory framework is really consistent between individual and group.\nJack McGarry\nI\u2019d remind you as well, Tom, that this is not our initial foray into group renewals.

", ["Yes, that's a good question. If you look at Long Term Care, there's really three kind of sets of assumptions that company uses, there's their statutory assumptions underlying the statutory reserves. We do not have morbidity improvement and our statutory reserve assumptions.\nThe second basis is your GAAP assumptions we do include morbidity improvement and the GAAP assumptions. And then the third basis, which is a very important one as well as the basis we're using for cash flow testing. So it is quite possible for a company to not have morbidity improvement in their statutory reserves and not have morbidity improvement in their GAAP reserves, looks like use morbidity improvement in their cash flow testing assumptions to test the adequacy of both their stat story and their GAAP reserves.\nSo we do not have morbidity improvement in our statutory reserves we do include in our updated reserve basis on a GAAP basis the morbidity improvement, and we do use that same morbidity improvement assumption in our reserve adequacy testing. The exception to that would be in the state of New York where morbidity improvement is not allowed."]], ["I wanted to ask one on the long-term care and the benefit ratio we saw in the second quarter, again in the high 90%s, and just to kind of reflect on how that stayed at that level relative to the first quarter. ", ["So I would start looking at the quarter, compared to first quarter. In the first quarter, we did have high claims incidence. But we also had very high mortality and we had very unfavorable terminations in our active claim block, so deaths and lapses in the active claim block. I would say this quarter the incidence levels continued. However, mortality reverted more toward kind of our long-term expectations. Still a little bit above the long-term expectations, but much closer to it.\nBut at the same time the active life terminations reverted back to - more towards the long-term norm as well. And so, those two things kind of offset each other in the quarter and we were left with a very similar level of loss ratio in the first quarter related to claims incidence. In terms of looking at claims incidence, two quarters does not trend make in long-term care. We've actually seen periods where there've been four and six quarters of either very low incidence or very elevated incidence that is turned around in other periods.\nSo I wouldn't read too much into the second quarter and first quarter, it's not - we wouldn't have the expectation that this is it forever. With that said though, as we look at our reserve work and we update our assumptions, our assumptions will incorporate the current experience we're seeing. And so, post assumption review, I would not expect loss ratios in the high 90%s to continue."]], ["So first just on your guidance on the result for the long-term care review, how much of the expected amount roughly is because of these changes in interest rate assumptions versus incorporating the uptick in incidence that you have seen?

So we're not in a position to really parse those assumptions and talk about what the individual changes are. We do anticipate that we will provide more a specific guidance when we actually do finish the work and we announced the results of the work.\nBut it's important to note that that this review is a comprehensive review. It's looking at all of the different assumptions. I think it's hard to find an assumption that stays the same as opposed to thinking about what assumptions change. But in aggregate, we feel very good about the progress that work is taking. We feel good about the limit we put out in the marketplace. And we think it will have a meaningful impact on the results of long-term care going forward."]], ["And then, my second question is just on cash flow, I know, statutory impact is sort of separate and GAAP impact is separate from the amount of cash that you guys actually put down into the long-term care captive as well as first Unum, the New York entity.

We are in a very strong cash position now, we ended the quarter at over $1 billion of cash and even after having paid off that maturing note. We are still at the high-end of our cash range.\nAs we said the - if we do take a charge and there's a lot of work to be that remains to resolve that, it would be predominately a GAAP charge. We would see that potential for maybe some smaller statutory events mostly related to disabled life reserve updates that we might do. As you know, the active life reserves are locked in.

Just one thing, I'd start out with the annual claim volume is more probably in the range of 4,000 claims a year, so just kind of for level setting. You may be looking at the information that only covers one of our legal entities or a subset of our block. But I'll go back to kind of what Jack said around just the relationship between the reserves on this block and the reserve margins in our premium levels. We have about $160 million of quarterly premium on this block.\nAnd so if you equate that to a loss ratio that's about $1.6 million for every point of loss ratio. Our average claim size is around $100 million - I'm sorry, $100,000 per claim. So you can kind of do the math and see that it doesn't take a whole lot from a variance of count to drive change in our loss ratio. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of perspective based on it's probably somewhere in the range of 400 to 500 claims a quarter."]], ["So Jack, I think after you guys took the charge in 2014, you would describe that as unlikely to have to make any adjustments for probably at least another three years.

I mean, we're really feeling like we're putting together a robust best estimate of what the future is likely to hold.\nWe'll continue to monitor experience as it emerges related to that, we certainly expect without something really dramatic happening for those.

But they're not getting older as fast as you would - it's not like the block ages a year, every year, because older people die out.

So it wouldn't be a jumping off point. And if you look at our experience, again, I go back to it. If you plot our experience by quarter, it has been very volatile. There have been periods of two, three, four quarters where we've had significantly elevated experience. There's been periods of two, three, four quarters, where our incidence rates have been well below that trend line.\nAnd that's the nature of this business. It's going to be a long haul. It's going to be volatile. It's - but almost the good part of the business is that it allows you to manage it over the long haul, because things that emerge are not - there aren't cliff events in long-term care.

So relative to the growth in reserve senses, and this is actually smaller than that charge, the charge in 2014 was around $700 million pre-tax.\nAnd again, the thing I'd point you to is we haven't completed the work yet. We haven't finalized where our reserve assumptions are. We've given you a number that we are not likely to exceed. We haven't given you a number yet. And so, I'd ask for your patience to allow us to do our work, allow us to finalize where our assumptions are, make sure that we validated those assumptions and done all the quality assurance.\nAnd, I mean, hold off, we're going as quickly as possible, but I'd wait to see where the charge is."]], ["I mean, what you're saying here is that, that the recent claims experience is probably not in the assumptions that are going to be used, hopefully, to determine the charge, if there is one in 3Q.\nIs there a risk that the assumptions that you chose are inducing or are backing into the size of the charge rather than starting from the ground up of what you really have and saying. ", ["Yeah. It feels a little bit like you're assuming there is one assumption that's driving everything we do. That's not the case. We're looking at all the assumptions. And let me bring it back to the process we're going through to do this. The first step in that process is to do a thorough and exhaustive experience analysis, looking at emerging experience relative to our underlying assumptions.\nAnd so, we've made progress on the work. We've not completed that work as yet. But we've made enough progress to kind of understand the box we're playing, which is still a pretty wide box. So that's the first step. It's the underlying experience analysis. That experience analysis drives choices around what our best estimate of assumptions will be.\nAs we make those choices, we run the results through our projection models. You need to step back and analyze those results, understand what the drivers are, understand not only the underlying reserve that that generates, but also understand how that reserve will function as experience emerges, and what the incidence of earnings that's likely to produce under different sets of scenarios.\nAnd after you've analyzed those results, it's an iterative process. So you'll go back and some of that analysis will identify things that you may want to tweak in the process. So we're working through that right now. So there's not a single assumption set. But it's not an engineering piece around here's the result we're engineering assumptions to get there.\nIt's really an analysis of what we've experienced over the last 5 and 10 years, what we think that portents for the future, in making sure that we have a robust assumption set that covers that.\nRichard McKenney\nAnd I think there are two things you said, Josh, which are important. One it will include up-to-date assumptions through the point of when we make the determination. The second is you talked about being a top-down - it's absolutely a bottoms-up process as Jack talked about, down to every assumption, dataflow. And so, it rolls from the bottom up in the process and we'll see where the numbers come in.\nBut I think that it's important, as Jack said, that we've seen enough now, where Jack and the team think they can make a reasonable call. And that's what we've done. But there's still work to do. And I certainly appreciate the work, the team is, they're going to close this process 50% faster with all the quality, with more people in the process.

Bob, I appreciate the question. I mean, I think you do - maybe just stepping back even from the pure second quarter, I think you've hit on one of the primary headwinds when we think about before-tax operating earnings for group disability. And Jack highlighted it a bit.\nBut when you think about just the - based on new money, a slow decline in the portfolio yield, yeah, you look at the work we've done around looking at reserves behind the line and finding some spots where we've updated assumptions and got a bit more capital efficient. And certainly, we have experienced favorable incidents. And as importantly, very steady and strong recovery patterns, which is leading to a modestly shrinking claim block.\nAnd when you kind of take the sum total of those changes, on the one had it means less income from invested assets that's a few million dollars of pressure if you look out it on a pure quarter over prior year pure quarter basis. And I think that that kind of order of magnitude headwind is going to persist, all else being equal over the next couple.\nThat being said, a more capital efficient business is allowing us to generate a stronger return on equity. So we're now in the mid to high teens in the group disability business. It's a really healthy business. The stickiness of client retention we've highlighted across the group business, certainly true in group disability. The stability of the loss ratio just a tick over 76% here in the quarter and right in line with where we forecasted it would be at Investor Day.\nAnd then, when I look at it, I mean, I think where we're going to offset some of that headwind will be is, as we find ways to grow the business profitably. And to look at some of the trends we're seeing with growth in employee and contrib pay, in group disability. And then, as we grow our capabilities, particularly around absence management, regulatory compliance around leave, the growth in corporate leave solutions. We've added some technology in helping individual employees plan around leaves. And all those I think are contributing to a more bullish outcome for growth going forward.\nSo I'd say that's one of the general picture on group disability.\nJack McGarry\nYeah, Bob, this is Jack McGarry.

And so, we have to stand here today and look forward, and so it is not beholden to that path in 2014 that we picked. It says we sit here and look forward and what\u2019s the path that we choose for the future, and so I think that\u2019s what goes into our assumptions every year as we go through it, we kind of give you a track as to what we saw then, what we're seeing now that would stay flat for a period of time, and then we will start to trend up and we\u2019re hopeful that we will, but we continually look at that as we do every year in terms of what a go forward path might look like."]], ["The, just curious if you could comment on just looking through the 2017 long-term care supplements, for Unum and several others, looks like incurred claims went up a lot in 2017 both for Unum and for the industry.

It has been running around that 110%, 115% pretty consistently for the years before 2016 it returned to that in 2017. So, when I look at the stat forms, I would pick out 2016 as being the outlier. I wouldn't really pay too much attention to the increase of over 2016 because if you look at the trendline we were pretty consistent with that. I would say a couple of other things on the statutory forms.\nFirst of all, the run out of our disabled claim reserves, that run out over the entire period was about 330 million, negative. We also increased strength and reserves by 340 million during that same period, and so if you offset those two based on our current reserve level for claim reserves, things are working out pretty good and very steady.\nI think the other thing on those forms you can see the impact of rate increases are gross to net ratios.

", ["I made those statements, you know we're going to have to go through the work, what I would reiterate is there is good margin between where our GAAP reserves are right now in the statutory front and that comes from three different places. One, we\u2019ve exceeded our interest rate assumption. So, our portfolio rate today is well above where we expected it to be in our reserve assumptions at this point that creates margin. The second one is, we have, we still have room in our rate increase assumptions both in terms of expectations of the rate increases that have already been filed as well as the opportunity to refresh and refile new rate increases based on any new set of assumptions that we might come up with.\nAnd we have, you know expected at year-end $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion difference between our stat reserves and GAAP results. So, I can\u2019t tell you right now what the answer is because we\u2019ve got to go through the work, but I would reiterate that there is a lot of margin between where our current GAAP reserves are and where our stat reserves are."]], ["And then just in terms of the price increases, I'm assuming that what you've asked for so far was assuming in the 85% to 90%, so if we are elevated 90% to 95%. ", ["I'd say it's more complex than that Suneet, the - you make assumptions in reserves that it's not purely a one-to-one like price hits the loss ratio. There are a lot of factors around, how the incidences of things emerge and how they hit you reserve factors.\nSo I want to say it's a direct tie. I think we're comfortable that with the dry powder we have on rate increases given emerging experience and the buffer we have between gap and stat that we wouldn't see the remedy to this causing any impact on our capital plans. But if - in long term care it's a long term thing, it's not what happens this quarter you're predicting things out over the next 40 and 50 years. Really that has to do with how a lot of different assumptions interplay."]], ["I mean the reason I asked the question, if I thought that some of the larger state approved some price increases in the recent past, but one of the deal they struck with that that carriers wouldn't come back for five years or so. ", ["Well, some of those large states, we still have outstanding, so we haven't heard back from them. I'll give you an example of New York gave us a long term care rate increase. Several years ago they did put do not return sign on it for a while. That's expired at this point. And we will go back to New York going forward. So the fact of the matter of five years is a drop in the bucket in the long term care business. And really that trade off we would hope that any reserve assumptions we built into requests for a rate increase would survive a five year period."]], ["First one just on capital generation, uses of capital I mean it sounds like even though the cash taxes are a bit higher than GAAP taxes, there's still incremental free cash. ", ["Yeah. So fortunately, we've entered this period in a really strong capital position we do have $864 million of holding company cash. At holding company, even after our DTA write-off, our RBC ratios are still comfortably in our 375 to 400 range. And actually we've entered this period with lower leverage than we've had in quite a long time. So we do see the impact of free cash flow we purchased a Polish company. Just recently, I think we will continue to look for merger and acquisition opportunities either to expand our reach, or frankly also capabilities that help to sort of support and complement our offerings in the marketplace.\nBut the other thing is, we're being understandably cautious at the moment, because it isn't clear yet how the NAIC is going to react, what they're going to do with their capital formulas whether it's going to be a phase-in or an immediate impact and what the follow-on on the C1 factor changes would be.\nIt's also unclear how rating agencies are going to react S&P, and A.M. Best have come out and said, we use our own capital formulas that are not tax adjusted and don't expect to react to RBC formulas, Moody's still kind of a wild card out there. That will have to wait and see. And the one that's really unclear, is how you and other investors are going to react. Are you going to feel comfortable with RBCs, dropping as a result of the formula changes or not, so we're going to. stand around, we're going to maintain a strong balance sheet, irrespective of what happened we're really confident that we can respond to it quickly without necessarily impacting our - the strength of our balance sheet as a company.\nAnd so I think we're in a wait-and-see moment, but it's great to be coming into this with such a strong capital position to start."]], ["Just a follow up-on long term care, Jack, your comment on old age mortality, I just want to get a better sense for what's happening there from what I gather at least, but what I'm just guessing is that that would be something like Alzheimer's patients living longer. ", ["No. I didn't talk about old age mortality extending, I don't think there's a ton of evidence of that happening. What I said is it's volatile. And so you can't judge old age mortality, but what - by what happens in one or two quarters, you need to go through full cycle, judge it on annual and quinquennial kind of looks at it. And what we saw particularly in the - we had - the way of it would pretty good mortality in the first quarter of 2017. We had very poor mortality in the following three quarters one of the top comparisons between fourth quarter 2017 and fourth quarter 2016, is the flu season hit earlier in 2016.\nWe saw an uptick on mortality and that resulted in more favorable results. But you're going to go through the cycle. You have to see how the years unfold it's not something you'd react to on a quarterly basis. And again kind of the improvements in mortality that doesn't happen one or two years, that's something that happens over decades."]], ["But nothing there seem dramatic.\nSo with Jack's comments, so is that - is it more like a premium production challenge from Brexit kind of in the southern part of England or is it - are you seeing shades of what we saw when there is financial pressure there last time around, where you see a little bit higher claim incidents? ", ["Yeah, Randy, let's go to Peter O'Donnell in the UK to get our Brexit update. Peter?\nPeter O'Donnell\nGreat. Thanks very much, Randy. So the way I describe it is, the UK is doing well in a tough environment. So actually our results as you say, there's nothing dramatic happening where we're sort of performing recently well. If the market was better, I think we'd be forming a lot better. And, of course, the relativity to the US world is one of the things I guess that influences that commentary.\nIn terms of what we're seeing, really going back to what were the implications of Brexit, so there's three things I'd point out to you. One is those lower interest rates, interest rates are lower for longer, which means for us our interest rate sensitive products we've been putting right through in 2017.\nI think there is some chink of light there in that. We are seeing the market begin to move as well. So, some of the competitors are starting to put rate through, which gives me some confidence going into 2018 that that will be a slightly easier environment to be more competitive in. But in saying that, our sales numbers and our premium numbers were pretty good last year.\nThe second thing is this political uncertainty and economic uncertainty. So what we are not seeing is that natural tailwinds you get from wages and you get from sort of employment growth, particularly at the large employer end. That's been muted in 2017. And I think that will continue in 2018. The uncertainty is continuing and until we have a clear plan that companies can plan for in terms of the exit, that's just a headwind for us.\nAnd the third thing as you pointed out, we have seen slightly higher incidents across the industry on our income protection side. That's something that we are factoring into our pricing. So we're putting more rate into sort of rectify that. But that's been something that's been a little abnormal in 2017. We probably think that will continue good in 2018, but nothing dramatic in terms of what we're seeing.\nAnd I think if you remember our guidance, flat to slightly up earnings is where we're positioning our numbers."]], ["And then, just on any of the other products where you're filing with regulators that you - do you have any thoughts on how taxes if - I realize cash taxes are going down less than GAAP. ", ["Mike, go ahead.\nMichael Simonds\nYeah, it's Mike. It's very little. And for the reasons that Jack and I talked about earlier on the call. For most of the products we're talking about, pretty de-minimis impact on the actual percentage of premium that might be impacted. So anytime, we're going to take a new product or a rate filing on active business to department of insurance. Much more important is going to be what the trends on the underlying risks are, how expenses have emerged, then the tax rate.\nJohn McGarry\nI'd say, Jimmy, too I don't think there's any place in our company other than the Closed Block, where we're filing for increased rates."]], ["I think earnings in this segment, $108 million, that's the highest level you've had as far back as I can see in your history, and it's significantly higher than it's been in the last few quarters. ", ["Great. Thanks, Jimmy. We'll have Jack.\nJack McGarry\nSo the earnings were higher than we've seen in a while. Two factors that, I think, are drivers, the growth in the business. It's growing 7% a year. So of the 17% growth, that would be 7% of it. We did have a favorable quarter from an expense perspective, favorable from risk and favorable from DAC development. I'd say those factors were kind of pretty consistent levels. I think they may settle back.\nEven though we had very favorable expenses in the third quarter, we've been on a good trend as a company with our expense ratio, and we'll continue to actively manage expenses going forward. So I'd say, it's probably a little higher than the go-forward rate. But we're really pleased with the performance of the line."]], ["First, just if you can talk about your view on your long-term care, there is, I think you've been earning yield relatively close to what you'd assume but you are assuming a ramp up in the next few years in interest rates. ", ["I\u2019ll start out Jimmy. Jack, you want to talk about\u2026\nJack McGarry\nSo, from long-term care perspective we've actually exceeded our new money rate bogey in every quarter since we took a reserve charge at year-end 2014. You know that help build some margin relative to the initial reserve assumptions we do have interest rates increasing beginning soon and increasing over time where we\u2019re still hopeful. We will see that happen but time will tell in any case, we feel very comfortable with where we are right now.\nWe would also note as we said many times that we have a good buffer between our statutory reserves and our GAAP reserves and so even if interest rates don't rise according to that projection. We feel comfortable that any of that would be a GAAP event as opposed to a capital event.\nRick McKenney\nMike, you want to take on stock op.\nMike Simonds\nSo, we officially entered the medical stop was market as of 71, taking proposals for 11-18 affective. WE are taking a slow entry into that market. But we do like it overall it\nSo about $14 billion industry. It\u2019s growing at a low double-digit clip and importantly for us a lot of the same underlying fundamentals of understanding the data that goes into actuarial pricing translating that into good discipline case level underwriting having a field force that understands the importance of balanced growth and profitability.\nWe feel like, we've got some capabilities to bring to bear in that market. Also, importantly it gets us insight into what employers planning to do with their overall employee benefits program earlier in the cycle. So, we get a good look at what the employee base looks like from health perspective as well as what we are planning to do with health plan design/\nMany if we not most of our products wrap around that health decisions. So, it\u2019s a good strategic insight at a case level. So, I don't expect we\u2019ll be talking about large impact to our P&L here in the next 12 to 24 months. In the long term, I think it's got the potential to be a nice business for us."]], ["So, Jack, in terms of thinking about capital management, you\u2019ve been generating more, more than you been spending on buybacks and dividends, building whole co-cash and I know you mentioned short of taking a wait-and-see approach based on tax reform et cetera.\nBut if we sort of fast-forward to next year's plan and assume you keep building at a similar rate issued in the first half would that be enough of an offer where you could then at least commit to 2018 higher cash flow being committed to the higher buybacks and dividends.\nIs that sort of the way to think about that you\u2019re -- the reason for accelerating the buyback now is more building a bluffer in case there is tax reform. ", ["So we have a buffer now, but we\u2019re extremely pleased with statutory earning that we\u2019ve been generating 225 million this quarter. That's been consistent \u201816 and \u201817 that builds free cash flow generation. We\u2019re not in a position where we think we\u2019re going to build a cash buffer forever.\nSo, we need to decide you know and understand. We need decide what to do with that capital. We expect to make that decision at the end of this year. And so, we have excess capital and we will we will put that to work. We\u2019re not going to save it forever."]], ["I think you were talking about the portion of the block that had not renewed had them I guess it's the margin -- I'm assuming it's a margin of about nine points lower than the portion that had renewed.\nCould you just dive into that a little bit more? ", ["So, if we look at what's the terminated premium and where did that business run relative to the active, that comes through the renewal cycle and process. There is a ninth point spread between the two and let me just add a little color.\nWhere we feel that most acutely is in, I would describe the midmarket, I would say 100 employees up to 2,000 employees that's where we see the most competition. You have carriers that focus at the small end that are trying to move up into that midmarket, carriers that have traditionally been in a very large employer space investing to try to move down and gets pretty choppy there in the middle.\nIt was nine point spread in total, but the business that we lost in that midmarket was actually at a loss and a notable loss. So those are typically being taken at enforced rates. We're looking to move them up and someone's willing to take them on where they're sitting currently."]], ["The only other question I have is Jack, this is about 10 quarters now since the long-term care charge at the end of '14 and an update on the next several years pass of targeted new money yields and then the increase thereafter.\nCan you just -- I know you've said you've exceeded the 5%, but what's the actual number that you guys have achieved over the last 10 quarters or so? ", ["I would say we haven\u2019t shared the actual number. We're not going to get in the business of sharing our actual quarterly new money rates against our portfolios, but it's been a reasonable beat and so we feel good about where we are.\nIf you look at our history over the last 10 quarters. The good news is our actual results are a little bit further up that curve than the 5% and so we have a buffer, but in the next one, two, three years, we're certainly going to need to see an upward movement in interest rates or we're going to have to look at the reserves."]], ["Alright, and then just another question so, obviously one of your big competitor has announced that they're looking to strategic alternatives for the employee benefits business, has that announcement created any impact on the marketplace in terms of competition or pricing? ", ["I will let Jack talk about the competitive landscape?\nJack McGarry\nSure, thanks Humphrey. So, generally our policy isn\u2019t to comment on any specific transaction that may or may not be in the marketplace but maybe to take your question more generally and talk about competitive trends. The group insurance market in particular remains a very competitive marketplace with a number of carriers I think looking to take some share. I think we -- I wouldn't call it abnormally competitive though, I\u2019d say probably the one place that stands out is what we would term the middle market. So that I think employers between 200 and 2000 employees. We have seen over the last couple of years carriers that typically play in the small end of the market look to move up as well as some carriers that play at the very high end of the market look to move down. They sort of all converge in the middle market and it's gotten a little bit choppy there. But on balance I'd say it's a pretty typically competitive market and we see plenty of opportunities to find ways to distinguish ourselves and grow over time."]], ["as a whole sort of in line with the trends you set out at the guidance call but good disability looks like it suffered as we saw a little bit of a tick down in persistency. ", ["Hey Seth its Mike, I\u2019ll take it. Appreciate the question. You are correct, persistency dropped by about a point but I think it's important to keep in mind that that's from a historical high that we've enjoyed over the last couple of years and in the high 80's across both groups segments. We feel really good about where we're situated and the care we're taking of our clients that they're staying with us at that rate. But that tick down in persistency paired with relatively flat sales year as we stayed disciplined on the new pricing front combined to put a little bit of downward pressure on the group disability earned premium line for sure.\nLike I said I am optimistic on the new sales front as we sort of look forward into the pipeline. So I don't expect the premium trends to change dramatically. I think the mid-term outlook is a positive for some improvement there and I do think it is important to take one step back to and maybe look at the business in total. It is very good to see such strong both sales in our premium growth and voluntary benefits. It's really exciting to see the early days momentum in the dental and vision benefits business. And if you take all those lines together sales were actually up 11% in the quarter which is really encouraging and we're generating solid earned premium consistent with the optimism and the long-term growth story here."]], ["Just given how high the margins have been in that business should we be thinking in the next couple of years that you'd be lowering prices at all because I assume, just taking the midpoint of your range on group LTD in the high 70's that, that would imply like a very high ROE, if we kind of overlay that kind of result. ", ["Thanks Tom, yeah it is Mike. Appreciate the question and I think you went to a productive place which is the returns on the business are really strong and they're in line with what our expectations would be for group insurance. So we are probably more in a mode of maintaining those returns versus looking to expand those. And I think that does present the opportunity for us on a relative basis and the market continue to focus on growth. I do think there's a constant, it's important to keep in mind there's constant work in your renewal program that even on average the block overall is performing. We're always working through the inventory of clients and looking at where each individual client's risk is performing. So there's always going to be that work that happens and it's sort of a critical component that's been successful in this business. But in sum total I think you're accurate, we're at or right within the range of targeted margins and don't see the need to further expand that."]], ["First just a question on long-term care and if there's been a change in the reviews on reserve adequacy I think you\u2019ve said in the past that if given where rates were and given your success in getting price hikes you don't feel the need to potentially take a charge this year on long-term care. ", ["I mean rates are a little bit lower, remarkably the third year it has bounced back up to right around that 3% range. And so that's off less than the tenure is. The first quarter as we said we exceeded our 5% target. We continue -- as a result we continue to build margin in our asset base and build margin in our reserves. I would view our position as having a lot of flexibility as to when and how much of a long-term care charge we may take. I don't think there's anything pressuring us at the moment to take a charge in 2017. But again we're going to look at it holistically around how we manage the block and what we think is in best interests of shareholders."]], ["And then, Scott as you talked about the shaping for 2020 and kind of the components, the guide you did talk about your planning for ongoing investments, how should we think about 2020 level of investment? ", ["Yes, Erinn, so a couple of things that are I think behind your question. So first of all, if you look at our implied guidance it says modest SG&A leverage And so I think that's part of your question. So let me answer that more broadly. As we think about our long-term algorithm it is absolutely still in place. We\u2019ve talked about high single-digit top line growth, gross margin expansion both through mix and also some of the -- frankly some of the moves we've made from a portfolio standpoint, all those thing and innovation and all the other things we talk about pricing, power, all those driving gross margin and operating margin expansion. As it relates to our investments, we\u2019ve said consistently that we are going to continue to opportunistically invest around those key capabilities and strategic priorities that we think are giving us a separation from our competitive set and really driving some of the growth of our brands and I would point backwards and say one of the reasons we think we are ahead of our long range plan is because of some of those capabilities that we've been investing in. Some areas, I mean, we\u2019ve talked about them, D2C, digital, in particular, which by the way drives both gross margin and also as an SG&A component that comes with it, insights analytics, advanced manufacturing, demand creation. It's the same things that we've been talking about, Erinn. Now as -- the other thing I would just point out is, listen, this is the first guidance for the year. As you can imagine, we are giving you guidance that we have strong confidence in. As we see opportunities from margin expansion, we are going to make sure we're delivering our commitments to the street. Don't forget our earnings are up 17% to 19%. I will say that again, 17% to 19% earnings growth. But we believe the investments back into our business are one of the reasons why we\u2019re seeing the success that we are and that is an area once we fulfill our commitment to the street that we\u2019re going to continue to make those investments."]], ["And then, I guess the other question I have is when you take a step back over the last few months just at retail including some of the reports recently from your wholesale customers, the environment is definitely -- gotten a little bit tougher and you guys are outperforming, but can you just talk about how the order books for your businesses have materialized on a wholesale basis? ", ["Yes, Bob. Scott here. I guess the big picture is we\u2019ve seen -- we see strong order books and at least in our brands and our key partners the general sentiment has been positive. Now part of that too is inventories at retail are pretty good shape, I mean, not universally, there's always exceptions out there. But as a general rule, it's been a good year. With -- sell-through has been pretty got, at least in where we play and we are in pretty good shape. So we see confidence. I wouldn't say a big change, frankly. Better or worse, we see continuation of the support that we've seen coming out of the second half.\nSteven Rendle\nAnd Bob I would add the result of the portfolio moves that we've made over the last 24 months, we have navigated our way away from that middle portion of the marketplace and where we have wholesale penetration is in the better parts of the market.

Also one of the things going on within Timberland is a focus on improving profitability, you see some of that drag in the outdoor results and you'll see that improve as we go next year. Some of that's at the cost of top line. For example, some underperforming stores which are at the end of their lease are going to be close. So when you put those two factors together, there's about a point of growth that is hidden in the implied guidance. So again, zooming out of click, I think you should say modest improvement as we're focusing on those fundamentals, that game plan is very similar to The North Face plan over the last -- looking back several years.\nSteven Rendle\nAnd, Michael, I will try along a just a little bit here. I think we\u2019ve said in last couple of calls, we're in that low single-digit growth place for the Timberland brand. We are a little bit behind where we'd like to be, but the diversification strategy that we've been talking about it's working. We are seeing double-digit growth across all regions with our non-classic styles. And as those continue to grow, we will change the waiting and dependence of the classics business that this brand had for such a long part of its history. We are seeing good growth with our peril. You also mentioned how we\u2019re elevating the brand and the trial that we did on, the pop up on Fifth Avenue has informed a new brand prototype that you'll see us continue to rollout thoughtfully, testing and learning this fall. But the team continues to work on elevating the brand, focusing on taking that that brand focus into the design and merchandising aspects of the business. We\u2019ve talked about the addition of Christopher Raeburn and elevating all elements of design and create -- creativity. We are still a little bit behind where we'd like to be, but we remain very optimistic with where we intend to be at a mid single-digit growth potential in the out years."]], ["I just wanted to follow-up on the G&A question and just may be to tie in the dyssynergies as well as the investment piece, but I know couple of years ago now and the 21 plan you put out a goal for 35.5% on the G&A ratio. ", ["Yes, Jonathan, so -- obviously, many of those factors are changed because of the -- exactly what you mentioned, the Kontoor spin, the acquisitions and disposition. So, for example, we\u2019re way ahead on gross margin from what we said and we bought some businesses with lower operating margins and all those things. I guess, two things I would point you to. Number one, think of the general algorithm with the gross margin mix driving our ability to invest in the business and we will continue to see leverage in SG&A and operating margin over time. And the other thing I'd say is I\u2019d point you to this fall, we recognize the need to reset our long range plan and we intend to do that at an Investor Day that we will host this fall and given the new shape of the business we will reset all those parameters. But you shouldn't take away from that that's a big change. The basic model is the same that you've been used to in terms of the growth rates in the general way that this is going to function. For example, I don't see any change in our gross margin trajectory. We are going to continue to see operating margins expand over time. We will see gross margin or SG&A leverage. We just need to reshape that in light of the new business model that we have, and that's what this fall will be about."]], ["But if I look at the results for fiscal '19, I know you beat the original earnings target by pretty significant amount, almost close to 10% and that's even with the incremental investments. ", ["Yes, that's a hard question to answer because we don't look at it from a formulaic standpoint. The first thing I want to reiterate, we are going to expand our margins, we are going to deliver our commitment to the shareholders. And where that is a firm commitment, Steve and I are rock solid on that. And as we look at investments, incremental investments, it's really about -- we look at these, we rack and stack them literally, and we look at what are those opportunities, what do we think the payback is going to be, is this going to create a true meaningful impact on the business or create a point of difference. And that's how we make those decisions and I would just say they're not all perfect. We haven't made a 100%, but we've done a pretty good job looking back. Again, I just point to the return on capital of 22% over the last year. That gives us confidence and you look at where we\u2019re at on our overall growth trajectory, that gives us confidence that in general we're making pretty good decisions and we will continue to feed the fires that we think are burning, propelling these brands. I will give you a couple specific examples that's implied in our 2020 guidance around demand creation. For example, we brought $1.4 billion of growth in the Vans business over the last two years, and on top of that we are still grown within our long range growth plans. So consolidating all those new consumers into the franchise around innovation products like ComfyCush, we think that's a really good idea and this is a moment in time where we want to really consolidate that growth. Think about that three years stack just from a minute, I\u2019m just going to back up. Think about the 3-year cumulative growth rate on that business, that's a pretty high bar and on top of that we continue to grow. So where we see opportunities, where we think we have a meaningful point of difference like ComfyCush, which is a brilliant innovation that the Vans team brought, we are going to invest in that. I\u2019d give you another example, FutureLight as in the TNF business. We think this is a moment in time and taking advantage of this moment in time, we are going to invest around that because we think it's a game changer. We think it's disruptive in the industry. So where we see opportunities like that, we're going to take those advantages. Now I don't know if that same thing is going to be if we should do better this year, I don't know if they'll be that type of investment available or not. So I can't say per se what we would -- whether we would invest or not, it depends on the situation."]], ["So you continue to deliver the very strong growth rates in Vans, but the implied growth rate for some of the other brands in that division has been reasonably weak and I think that\u2019s expected going forward. ", ["Yes, so one thing that's in the guidance is, remember, we sold Reef and that's not a discontinued operation, it's not material enough. So that really is weighing on the impact of the sector, particularly in the first couple quarters because that business was very spring oriented. So you're comping the majority of their business, but if you look our packs business, it's in the mid to high single-digit. A couple of call outs, our Eastpak and our Napapijri business which have really put several years in a row of high single-digit growth even into the double-digit along with really nice profitability growth. And we don't talk much about these brands, but they are real jewels and they continue to do well. They're not that large in the scheme of VF, but they grow and they\u2019re profitable and we think that these are exciting brands that you\u2019re going to hear more about in the future.\nSteven Rendle\nAnd to that point, I mean, these are brands where we're able to really test and learn many of our new brand building ideas and things that we're doing around creative vision work. And that that growth that\u2019s got mentioned for both Napa and Eastpak are really a result of greater clarity of what these brands stand for, a rationalization of the styles and the elevation of big stories and focusing on a few markets and really driving strong outsized growth. So think of these as certainly smaller, but good growth drivers, but they're important parts of our portfolio for our ability to learn, test and scale and they\u2019re certainly receiving the benefit themselves as they do that work."]], ["I wonder if you could spend just a moment on some of those brands and the trends that you\u2019re seeing there, Eastpak, JanSport and I think that Napapijri has been a growth spot there.

", ["Wow, okay. So let me try, Michael. So let me attack it a little bit differently and see if I answer your question. So if you look at Q2, the mix is about 60 basis points, a little better than what we've said over time. And rate has been a bit favorable, and that's true to the first half, right? But remember what we've said there, cost is a little favorable in the first half, turns a little unfavorable in the second half, and for the year, it's not a material impact. So you'll see a little of that first half, second half dynamic on the cost side. Mix moderates a bit in the second half as well, and some of the reasons for that we've talked about. You think about the Vans, we are full year 18-ish. 18% to 19% growth implies that in the second half, the growth moderates. Again, that we know that both from a DTC standpoint and just the absolute margins of Vans, that has an impact on the mix.\nSo \u2013 and then lastly, acquisitions in the first half, we start lapping WD. So for example, in the second quarter, acquisitions was negative 70 bps. As you know get into the second half, acquisitions are essentially a push, actually modestly accretive as you start getting into that lap as Altra and Icebreaker have margins that are at/ or above VF average. So again, big picture, you have your mix moderating a bit in the second half for the reasons that we talked about. That's implied in the guidance. You have you're rate, going from a little bit of a tailwind to a little bit of a headwind in the second half. But remember, the big picture there, pricing overall is moderating that. You have a little bit of timing quarter-to-quarter. And then acquisitions, for the full year, about 20 bps. Essentially, all in the first half of the year because as we start lapping in the second half, you don't see that impact. I don't know if I got you there, Michael, but hopefully\u2026"]], ["And maybe if you could go back to the last time you did, I think it was last year, where \u2013 when did you see the effect of that, the benefit of that materialize? ", ["Yes. I would think of it more as a flywheel. We laid out the \u2013 and declared, I think pretty specifically, what those areas we were going to invest in and we\u2019re continuing to invest in. And when I say opportunistically, things like demand creation. If we have \u2013 there are times when we want to lean in a little heavier based on what we see as an opportunity, but those areas of investment really aren\u2019t changed. Digital, holistically, analytics, insights, our DTC broadly in terms of capabilities and brick-and-mortar as well as in the digital and how those work together. I mean, these are the areas where we\u2019re focusing our investment. So I wouldn\u2019t say what we\u2019re doing now is just a specific finite amount of time for the payback. We're looking at this as developing, consistent, defendable points of difference over a period of time. And we will sustain that investment at a certain level. With my comments again on opportunistic typically are more around specific initiatives where we see an opportunity to really lean in and accelerate."]], ["And if I look more on a trailing 12-month basis, the outdoor segment margin is quite a bit below active, and I think in the low teens in terms of the margin rate for the outdoor. ", ["Yes. So, there is no doubt. We can and will be more profitable in this segment, first of all. I'll just put a little historical context here. If you go back a couple years, as we've really focused on, quality of sales, cleaning up the marketplace and reducing the discounting on off-price, we've walked some volume. We have not seen the kind of leverage we've typically seen, and we've also been investing in the future of these businesses. So if you think about where they are now compared to historic capability and what we see as the future capability, we see a lot of room to run here over time. The other thing I would say is The North Face, within that, it's relatively more advanced, right? And it is more profitable and more \u2013 and contributing more. Think about Timberland, as we've said consistently, a couple of years behind in terms of its evolution. So if you \u2013 as you look forward, I would think of this category continuing to grow, both from top line and leverage as well as margin expansion. And you should think about The North Face being slightly ahead of Timberland in terms of its profitability evolution."]], ["I just wanted to go back to Vans and what your outlook is for just specific franchises within Vans as we kind of go through the back half of the year. ", ["Yes. So, maybe, I\u2019ll start with that. You\u2019re right. Old Skool is about actually less than 25% of the total franchise. If you go back to the \u2013 probably the best way to answer that would be to refer you back to the Investor Day materials, where I think we unpacked that reasonably well, talking about the different franchises. But I'll give you \u2013 the short answer to that is we see broad-based growth. And we always, within this brand, see certain franchises that are trending a little higher than others. But over time, that's kind of the point, right? It's not just one thing. There's a product life cycle management, which shows as one is relatively stronger within where you're moderating in other areas. And over time, we've seen this engine continue to consistently deliver. For example, apparel, which is only about 20% of the entire Vans, is growing at a rate faster than the total brand growth, right? So you should think of this as being very broad-based and not really driven by just one franchise.\nSteve Rendle\nAnd I know specifically, in the footwear area, as you come into this time of year, this is where you'll see that MTE collection that we spoke about, more of the water resistant, more winterized versions of not just Classics, but you also see the Altra series continue to grow and its importance and scale. And the brand did a really good job talking about their whole focus on newness and being able to cycle new ideas through their DTC platform to find those next big levers of growth. Everything that they laid out really is just they'll be very methodical and maintain the rigor to keep that discipline in place."]], ["But you are also using digital technologies and consumer engagement really effectively and maybe you could help us think about or understand how you think about what's driving your business in terms of broad macro consumer confidence and [indiscernible] as opposed to what you're doing in your brands using digital and creating stronger connections with consumers in greater excitement around the product etcetera. ", ["Yes. So, I will take a first shot at this, Omar, Scott here. I'd say this is really much more about our brands and less about macro. I mean, the macro from what we\u2019ve seen macro conditions have not really changed that much over the last 18 months as it relates to our consumer now. Obviously, there's many things going on at the macro level that we\u2019re keeping an eye on. But as it relates to our consumers, we really haven't seen that much of a change. Now at some of the -- we\u2019re keeping an eye on some of the other -- some of the things happening geopolitically, but so far hasn\u2019t baked into our business and since where we haven't really seen either an upside or a downside, where I think you\u2019re seeing is a multiyear payoff of some of the focus on fundamentals and going back to basics in a sense kind of our big franchises. And what's happening in Vans has been a long-standing pattern, the TNF we\u2019ve been talking about for a couple of years, we are seeing the payoff. I think it's just a focus on fundamentals that\u2019s paying off more than anything that\u2019s happened on a broader basis.\nSteven E. Rendle\nAnd, Omar, let me -- I would add to that. Last year when we spoke to everybody in Boston, we talked about the work we've done on what we like to call the forces of change. And really diving into the changing consumer mindset and how should we be thinking as a portfolio of brands. And it's really putting the consumer even further forward in our thinking in every aspect of our company. And the integrated strategy that we rolled out in March that we continue to talk about guiding our decisions, we\u2019ve narrowed our focus on those things that we see being most important to putting our brands at the forefront of the consumer's mind. And as we\u2019ve continued to reshape our portfolio, we're focusing our portfolio on those brands that we can drive in our most connected to consumer for us on this long-term journey. So it is -- I think its intense focus on a very -- focused set of choices, building stronger capabilities within our brands, and even more deeply connecting our corporate functions to service and help enable the growth of our brands, you\u2019re starting to see the momentum build based on that focus.\nScott A. Roe\nYes, Omar, just one other factor I think that\u2019s relevant here is the portfolio actions that we\u2019ve taken, right. In terms of bringing and focusing on new growth factors such as Work, such as our Icebreaker, Altra platforms moving away from some of the more disruptive parts of the market where we saw a little bit tougher sledding. And you're starting to see that that mix and improved mix also shining through, I think as you look at our performance."]], ["So to that end guys, maybe you could also as a follow-up talk a little bit about what you're seeing -- what were you developing, technologies and capabilities you\u2019re developing that are scalable across the portfolio. ", ["Yes. Omar, I think that is the right way to think about it. I think VF is always been focused on looking for those leverageable capabilities that we could bring to our brands. But through this integrated strategy focus, a couple examples, certainly would be our digital platform and the advancements that we're making there on how to use that technology more productively, how to begin to use o the consumer data files that we have to more thoughtfully connect with consumers to drive that one-to-one relationship. That\u2019s so important and you see that really coming to life in the Vans results. Part of our strategy, we don't talk a lot about is act vertical work the we're doing in really tearing down our go-to-market processes and product creation and with the expectation of improving speed, improving quality through lesser SKUs and more focused merchandising. That work is going on within the North Face and Timberland and you are starting to see the results come to life there. I think the capabilities that we're bringing in to our portfolio, the Icebreaker acquisition was very intentional. That was a purpose led acquisition to bring in natural fiber expertise that we can scale beyond just Icebreaker and Smartwool across multiple brands in our portfolio with even stronger connection with our consumers. And then the last one is our increased attention on insights and analytics, taking what has been a strong consumer insights capability and now marrying that to an analytics capability for better decision-making not just on the consumer facing side, but on merchandising and supply chain decision-making to just improve the quality and efficiency of the work we do."]], ["And then for last year's Investor Day, I think you guys guided for Vans longer-term to grow 8% to 10% with wholesale guided to be low single-digit, but then D2C to a high single. ", ["Yes, on the first part of your question, Laurent, you had it right. I mean, kind of high single digits is where the second half is. And again, I think as I\u2019ve consistently said, hardest thing to predict in terms of the pace of this business, honestly we really haven't seen it slowdown. We know we\u2019re comping really big numbers. A lot of this is digital and D2C, essentially half of the business go-to-market is in the D2C area. So we know it will moderate at some point and that\u2019s we\u2019re at this point, although, frankly, we haven't seen that. We haven't seen that occur yet.\nSteven E. Rendle\nI would -- and Omar -- I mean, Laurent, I\u2019m sorry, what I would say, what you see going on right now is in our opinion is Vans is seeking its natural level as a top provider of active lifestyle footwear. So this growth, though exceptional, this brand has been growing in the teams since we\u2019ve acquired it in 2004. And they\u2019re focused on franchise management, bringing new products offers. We are seeing really good results with items like the Altra range, some of the new apparel offer as the brand expands and offers more choices to the consumers that have been with the brand for a very long time and the new consumers that are coming. We are looking forward to our September meeting in Costa Mesa, where you all can meet Doug and his team more personally and hear from them on what is driving this growth and what we believe to be that resettable long-term strategy that is very well-founded in a strong understanding of their consumer and a very disciplined approach to managing that brand."]], ["And then, I guess, the more fun question is, as we think about the line of sight on Vans, and I\u2019m sure you guys spent a lot of your time answering this questions, but obviously as we look across our coverage, it seems like we\u2019re in a bit of a fashion cycle that would very naturally include brands like Vans. ", ["So, Michael, let me take a stab at that. As I mentioned earlier, Vans has been growing at a mid-teen rate since VF acquired it in 2004. So this brand has been on a very strong solid growth trajectory.

But honestly, the way we look at it, we are resetting the rightful level of penetration that this brand has with the consumer and within the wholesale channel and as you -- as we do our channel checks, you can see the brand has just taken a larger footprint both on the footwear wall, the tables in the footwear section, but we're also now starting to place really relevant assortments of apparel.

", ["Yes, you will see growth this year in wholesale. And again, it's really even -- what you will see reported is it's going to be even better when you consider the quality of that growth. Another way to say that as you reduce stock price and obviously that puts pressure on the overall growth rate, but the underlying quality of that growth rate is better. So when we grow low single-digits, we have visibility to that from a wholesale standpoint given the order book we have and -- so that would be an inflection point of what we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters. Remember our overall algorithm, too, if you think about North America and this would be true with North Face as well as we're actually expecting overall big picture wholesale in the U.S to be down from a brick-and-mortar standpoint. We are growing with the digital wholesale partners, , those like Amazon and others as well as they click through, the digital component of our retail customers. So, again, where I think we have a realistic view of the marketplace as you look forward or not -- we are not ignoring the trends that we see out there, but it's important to distinguish and remember, they\u2019re not all created equal and as we see some very driving solid customers, and they\u2019re the great partners to us and we are working really well with them as we will grow our business with them over this period of time.\nSteven E. Rendle\nAnd, Ike, I would add, the focus on -- at wholesale specifically for the North Face, it's deeper focus on the key accounts that where we\u2019re able to really have strong in-store presentations. We are focusing on those specialty retailers that have particularly strong positions in specific communities. There continues to be ups and downs. And if we found the right partners, we know the right partners, and this is where we feel so confident about being able to place better assortments on a more frequent basis based on the lower excess inventory across those channels. The digital wholesale piece is very, very important. On a global basis, partners like Zalando in Europe, Asos. We talk a lot about Amazon as an up-and-coming integrated marketplace option for our brands, but you\u2019ve got key players like Dick's Sporting Goods in Nordstrom, you got the Moose Jaws that we focus on. But you also have a new strategic key account for us in Europe coming to the United States in JD Sports. We are excited to partner with them and find the right level of assortment to add value for our brand here in the U.S marketplace. So really understanding who those key accounts are, understanding what the right assortments are is really the basis of that comment around just the improved product merchandising decision-making and how that flows into an integrated marketplace set of decisions."]], ["And I know if I look to the past few quarters you were trending close of the high single digits and then in the first quarter accelerated to 10% organic growth. ", ["Well, I think we laid out all of our growth rates in the top brands. So you can see what our assumptions are. Obviously, in the first half our guidance implies relatively slower growth with acceleration in the second half first quarter as Steve said at the very beginning we did a little bit better albeit, on a small quarter. So should we do a little better, we might. But at this point one quarter end and a small quarter is that -- this is where we\u2019re at. So I think what we said specifically is organic guidance -- our organic top line is greater than 5%. So we said mid single digits here in the [indiscernible] top and the mid single-digits."]], ["I want to ask kind of big picture how much is based on backward looking actions that you've already taken and how much might be based on kind of the forward vision for any additional portfolio reshaping, especially since when I look at the Active segment, there are seven brands included, but Vans dominates that category, that segment today. ", ["Yes, I would caution you not to get to prognosticate too much based on our segments. The rules are pretty clear in the guidance and you could even argue whether they\u2019re always logical or not, but they\u2019re what they\u2019re. So we -- the justification for the new segments I think it's pretty straightforward. Our Outdoor Action Sports business has become so large that we felt it was good for you the readers to have one click down one more level of visibility rather than having at one giant segment, especially given some of the different financial characteristics of the two as you can see, right. And really that's the driver in the guidance is companies with like characteristics are grouped together and it's really no more or less than that."]], ["wholesale business, this is a matter of cleaning up distribution and I think, Steve, when I saw you in Denver, you mentioned like some of the better guys are starting to come back to you. ", ["It's a couple of those. I might characterize it slightly differently. Yes, we put a tremendous amount of effort in pulling down the promotional part of the brand that we've seen the last two to three years. That's not only in the wholesale channel through tighter inventory, but also within our own D2C environments, all to really put the brand back onto a much higher quality and we're seeing the results in not only our profitability, but in our partners' profitability.\nI think it's fair to say that we did have some dealers kind of moderate their assortments with our brand, but I would tell you it was as much what was going on in the broader marketplace, which we were part of, we weren't the only issue within the promotional environment that hit the outdoor industry.\nBut I would also tell you, and we've been pretty honest about this, is our product offer wasn't necessarily giving those better specialty dealers all of the reasons to invest their open buy with us. We're seeing that turn. I think you saw that energy in Denver, and it takes time to kind of refill that pipeline. But I think that is exactly why we remain confident and are putting that 6 to 8 percentage growth for 2019 out in front of you all today.\nScott A. Roe - VF Corp.\nSo, Sam, if you just put some numbers around that, it would be 1 to 2 points higher base if you normalized for reductions in off-price, lower promotional activity, the cleanup of Amazon that Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks. So the underlying trend is a bit better. But we're really seeing that payoff in our margins. You see that in our results, and also really focusing on our dealer and customer profitability as well, because that's really the key to the long-term growth for our business."]], ["Scott, if you could, just provide a little bit more color on the Nautica impact to the quarter, because by my math, it's about $0.03 to what the fourth quarter would have been. ", ["So your $0.03 is about right in the fourth quarter; about $140 million of revenue. And I've got Joe sitting right next to me here. We're going to clean this up. I think in the restated \u2013 since we're going disc-ops, in the restated numbers you can see where we were and where we are now. So the impact of that should be transparent by quarter. We can take that offline if you want to clean that up a little bit. But I think we provided everything you need in order to get the answer by quarter. Joe, you're welcome to add anything to that if you want.\nJoe Alkire - VF Corp.\nNo, that's right."]], ["Is it fair to say that you're getting a new consumer into the brand as opposed to your existing consumer that's buying multiple pairs relative to what they had been buying before?

We spend a lot of time understanding our consumer, our investments behind data and analytics specifically in the consumer area, being able to evolve our messaging from broad-based to now very individualized conversations, to really make that consumer feel unique and special and being able to offer up what we believe through our data science what that next appropriate item is for them to add to their collection of Vans product."]], ["My question then is that would be about 11% growth, which I know is in line with your long-term targets, but you will be having the Dickies contribution plus I think maybe some favorable currency margin impacts.

But I would say when you look at the underlying organic growth, you're right. It is right in line with our overall long-term growth plan. And we'll give you more visibility into what exactly the contribution is from Dickies when we come back in April.\nI would just point everybody back, remember where we are point in time on this five-year plan, right? We're one year in, and this is a period where we talked about relatively modest growth, which we're tracking a little bit ahead, and that's true both from a top and bottom line. So that really is what's shaping our long-term view. We're taking a long-term view as we think about the evolution of both our earnings profile, as well as the decisions that we're making, and that will give you a pretty good guidepost as you think about what to expect going forward."]], ["Is there anything to note by brand or collation that could be lasting going forward that we should watch for?\nAnd just lastly for the incremental investments any color on where that\u2019s going, how are they seasoned and your outlook on it. ", ["Yeah, good morning Dana. So, a couple of things on that related to gross margin. The story on gross margin really hasn\u2019t change its mix and the mix is our fast-growing businesses are highest gross margin and you saw in this quarter results particular strength in D2C and digital which that coupled with international and particularly Europe really have popped the gross margin in the quarter. But as we look forward, we expect those same drivers to continue, right. So, it was a little exaggerated in the third quarter also because our wholesale business for all the reasons we\u2019ve talked at for the long time was a little bit down from the timing standpoint, but overall, we see that mix driving forward in the next year and beyond.\nSteven Rendle\nAnd then Dana on the demand -- on how we\u2019re looking at the investments, about half of the investments that you\u2019ve seen is deployed this year are around demand creation and that\u2019s very much focused on Q3 and Q4 specifically towards D2C, our digital platform, but also driving broader brand awareness that benefits not only our broader brand but our wholesale partners.\nWe\u2019re also investing on many of our strategic priorities, in the roadmaps that we\u2019ve put in place specifically around data analytics, what we\u2019re doing with our digital platform, there are investments around advanced manufacturing and some of the innovation work we have going on there and clearly pushing dollars towards our design capability within our big brands.\nScott Roe\nDana, also asked about what we\u2019re seeing in the holiday, what\u2019s our outlook from a holiday standpoint.\nSteven Rendle\nFair enough. Okay. So, I\u2019d say Dana, we saw October start a little bit slow but as we see the weather turn in our favor, we\u2019ve seen really acceleration and that\u2019s very much a North America comment. We\u2019re bullish, our order book really reflects how our wholesale partners are thinking about setting up their floors more in line with consumer demand, that\u2019s here in the United States, but it\u2019s also true that how we\u2019re working in Europe and Asia and you really think we\u2019ve got good assortment sitting on the floors at the right time, inventories that are good check, and really now it's about driving sell through and that\u2019s where that demand creation investment has been put forward to help to drive that."]], ["And then maybe tie in digital and social media, if that an important element to what\u2019s going on with that brand and if there are learnings that you\u2019re developing around Vans that you can apply to some of the other assets in your portfolio? ", ["Great, Omar. Vans' performance is fantastic and the congratulations you put out to our team. So, I think know what the primary -- one of the primary reasons this brand is doing so well, it is the team that works on this brand across the globe and their intense focus and deeper understanding of who their consumer is. And we talk a lot about our expressive creator and who they are, what's important to them and how to reach them with our demand creation, and that really is about the social media in the digital platform.\nI think key things that are driving these results, Omar, it starts with product, the way our business team there, it really manages franchises and really things through the integrated marketplace, lands, placing the appropriate products in the right locations. And then the appropriate amount of newness, be it, new [color ways], the collabs that we do season to season, or the Ultra range that we launched this fall that are completely new product, higher price point, is continuing to move the brand further down its path.\nI would tell you, I think probably our single strength natural product, it\u2019s our D2C and how our brands stories are told within our own environments. You can see that here in the U.S. and across the globe and as we start to really mature and improving that area, we are starting to see us bring a segmented approach to boutiques that come and meet around The New General in Brooklyn to how that complements our street front and mall-based stores and how that all links together with our digital platform. It really is a well-oiled machine, very focused in deep understanding of the consumer and it really is about the digital connectivity and the storytelling that we tell to the digital platform that we think, is one of those key strategic advantages.\nSteven Rendle\nYeah. I will just add-on Omar that -- when you think about our investments and where we're making our investments, a lot of the digital platform inspiration has come out of Vans team, not all, but a lot of it. And as we make our investments, we're investing in [via applied] platforms, so that that learning and that capability can be -- that we can take advantage of that across the entire enterprise.\nIt would be hard for any one brand individually to fund this kind of investment and that's where we think the power of the portfolio when we have this is kind of how we approach these things. And this is one of our key strategic choices that we've made as we outlined in Boston. A close relation to that is also the customs platform, again piloted in Vans, but absolutely applicable for the wider enterprise and we see, this as continuing to grow throughout the organization."]], ["Seems like there was a pretty large swing from last quarter to this quarter as it relates to the overall guide for the year since it gets about 150 basis points swing to positive. ", ["Yes. So obviously, first of all, we don\u2019t try to get cues as it relates to currency. We got a basket of currency we\u2019re looking at and best of our knowledge, we call that, essentially where it is for the balance of the year and that\u2019s reflective and the outlook that we just talked about. As you look into \u201918, I guess couple of things. Number one remember that we had with a pretty long tail here, so we\u2019re going out 12 to 18 months. So, a lot of this has already been baked at slightly different rates as you look into next year, so you just got to remember that. Also from a translation standpoint, of course wherever the currencies are right now, that looks like, that\u2019s a tailwind, hopefully that will be the case. I would also just caution you to not focus too much on one factor, right. As we look into next year, cost is up a little bit in the fourth quarter, for example, we\u2019ll see that knock into next year. Yes, currency looks like, it\u2019s a tailwind, but you got to look at the balanced picture and we\u2019re not at the point of giving guidance for 2018 at this point."]], ["On the North Face, I guess the first question is, can you give us an update in terms of the trial that you're planning within a zone sort of where that stands today.\nAnd the second question on the North Face is. ", ["Great. Bob, so take your Amazon question first, it\u2019s early. And I would tell you, we\u2019re being very thoughtful. How does Amazon fit into that integrated market strategy, this brand has, what\u2019s the right segmented offer that can be used within that environment to speak to the consumer and sell-through at the rates that both of us would like to see.\nEarly, it looks good. We\u2019re having significant progress in helping clean up the unauthorized dealers that are on that site and in many ways, have been some of the market pricing dynamics the brands dealt with. So, it\u2019s early, we\u2019re confident, they are a long-term partner, they\u2019re an important partner on a global basis for sure.\nTo your inventory at retail, it\u2019s relatively clean. And the outdoor industry specifically for the North Face has been on this venture for a little over 12 months, we exited last year better than year before. Retailers have really focused, along with ourselves on really bringing product to floor based on where the consumer is shopping for those particular product categories and ways of product.\nSo, we\u2019re very -- feel really good about, where the inventories are. We\u2019re feeling good about the flow of merchandise and it\u2019s really -- are looking at this year in a very positive manner versus last year.\nI think if you were to contrast North Face, which is very seasonal and we\u2019re paying a lot of attention about the flow, contrast out with Vans, which is really a year round business, there is a lot of earnings from them, as well as Jeanswear on how we should be flowing specific to consumer demand that our North Face team has been tapping into and really now designing through these four territories specific collections based on each of the season and the given need and environmental conditions where the brand can really succeed."]], ["And there's a quick follow-up, Scott, I think you commented today, AUC was higher in the quarter, I think it's the first time you said that in a while, I think it was a tailwind to the first half. ", ["Yeah. So, if you remember, just zoom in back to the beginning of the year, we talked about -- we had some tailwinds from a cost standpoint through the first half, that turned to a headwind, starting in Q3 and going into Q4, we said Q4 would be the relative largest of the year. But, on balance, it was net zero and cost frankly isn\u2019t a real big factor for this year. So, also remember that we make commitments in arrears. So, when you're thinking about things like leather or cotton [loose], those commitments that we are seeing in the P&L today, commitments that were six months or so previously committed.\nSo, based on where costs are today, hard to predict. I wouldn\u2019t expect cost to be a major issue from what I can see right now going forward. But again, I caution you not to hover too much on those factors.\nJust, it\u2019s a good reminder, as you think about currency and as you think about costs, we\u2019re looking at -- we\u2019re making longer term commitments, we\u2019re hedging, where it\u2019s appropriate and we\u2019re balancing all this into our merchandising and our pricing discussion. So, as we\u2019re balancing that mix, we don\u2019t see any fundamental change in the trajectory of our margins. And I would suggest that\u2019s the way you should look at it."]], ["I guess, the two questions, the first one is more on when you look at the third quarter expectation in some of the detail, on like the order book or the changes in the order book, have there been any material changes to the total number or it's just a shift into the third or the timing of it? ", ["So Bob, I will take the first part of that. First of all, our visibility versus what you guys can see is really what we tried to bridge here, right. We -- there is really no change in what we see for the full-year relative to the order books. It's -- we\u2019re just talking about a little bit of a shift in timing. And just to put that in perspective, we are literally talking about a couple weeks. But that's the difference between Q3 and Q4. So, absolutely no change in the big picture. Just a little bit of timing between Q3 and Q4. That's why we tried to zoom out and say if you look at the second half, it's kind of in that mid single-digit range and normalizing, but you\u2019re going to see a little of noise when you compare to last year when you specifically look at just the third quarter.\nSteven E. Rendle\nAnd Bob your Jeanswear question, really there is little new news and little change to what we\u2019ve talked about in the past. The big room -- big picture remains the same, but our visibility is not great and we expect variability as we continue through the year though. We do see a line of sight to an uptick coming back in the fourth quarter. And it's important to remember, in our Jeanswear business our international business continues to be strong, especially in China where we see our Lee women's business continue to grow at double-digit great growth rates behind the two innovations, Body Optix and Jade Fusion. I think once we get through the destocking phase, velocity will increase and that's where I think, we, VF really comes into play and our ability to respond quickly with the strength of our supply chain and the quality of our team that works on that business not to be able to really read and react quickly to be back -- right back in the game."]], ["Is it more recent stuff that you\u2019ve seen as an opportunity, you decided to dial-up $40 million or is it just extending things from the Analyst Day and then -- obviously, how do you think about the payback on dialing that up, as you\u2019ve already gave an initial plan? ", ["Yes, Michael. This is Steve. So, really it's based on our confidence. As we look at where we are year-to-date and what we -- line of sight to what we have for the balance of year, we just have confidence in what we'd like to do, and what we've chosen to do is thoughtfully invest behind a select number of our strategic choices that we outlined in Boston to get us moving into 2018 where we talked about maintaining and building continued momentum. So about a quarter of that $40 million is going against demand creation within our big three brands in D2C and digital. We expect that to have an impact this year and into next year, but half is around specific strategic priorities. Design and innovation, data and analytics, our digital platform, absolutely continuing to move on advanced manufacturing and innovation projects we have in play there and then talent. Talent really is the great driver for us long-term and we are continuing to look at acquiring as well as developing key talent to help us grow long-term."]], ["I would love to check in on that, how you guys are feeling about innovation for the year and then also just a little bit more on some of the strength you're seeing in Europe? ", ["Yes, and I would love to talk about that. I think you remember, in Boston, we introduced you to Arne Arens, who at that point had been the leader of our European business and we are moving him to be the GM of the Americas business. He has since been appointed the President of the Global North Face business and just bringing that, that strong leadership presence and vision that he had in Europe to our total global business. And you just really see that in very short order, the confidence, that -- now sits within that broader North Face team, the clarity of focus against their strategy and you\u2019re starting to see the momentum in our D2C business, specifically. I will answer your point on what -- as we think about year and innovation. The Apex Flex jacket, which came out in the spring was a really good beginning to seeing new products move into the marketplace. This fall you're going to see dramatically updated Summit Series collection and there is a jacket in their called the Ventrix, that we're very excited about that not only plays into the Tier 1 aspect of the marketplace, but also into our -- into some of the broader market partners. We also see some new ski lines coming in conjunction with the focus on mountain sports. And then urban exploration, more of that North Face lifestyle presentation that just gets us into a broader set of usage occasions. I think what you see going on in Europe, really is a much tighter focus. If you remember couple of years ago, we went through a reset there as well and Arne led the -- the return to growth through a much, much more focused integrated marketplace management and significant segmentation tailoring and merchandising line, specifically to wholesale partners as well as our own D2C. And as that momentum builds, you\u2019re seeing those results not only in our first half, but in our expectation of getting that mid teen growth through the balance of 2017. So this speaks to the benefit of quality leadership, clarity of vision, and focusing on creating products and brand experiences that consumers can be drawn into."]], ["I guess, just to follow that really quickly, is -- we can see as it go through your stores, in the U.S now some of the bigger ones starting to get segmented harder between the four different North Face segments. ", ["We absolutely do, Michael. I mean, I think you remember at Boston we talked about a brand that would grow, 6% to 8% on a five-year CAGR. We just raised our guidance this year to the high-end of our mid single, which is at the low-end of that 6% to 8% growth CAGR that we posted for the five-year. So we have great confidence. Just move into these four specific brand territories, just allows our product team and the marketing team to focus on these key usage occasions for our core consumer. Speaking to the core consumer, but also attracting new consumers and you see that in Europe, you see that in Asia, and we have great confidence that that will absolutely work here in the domestic market."]], ["As you think of the digital wholesale business and the growth that you\u2019re seeing there, how do you think about your strategy with the Amazon's in the world -- of the world? ", ["So Dana I will start here. So how we -- I think it's more about how do we think about really those the digital wholesale partners that we have across the globe. And there's major pure plays. There's also key customers that we've been with for years and they are part of that integrated marketplace that have choices that we have and they\u2019re very important part. We talked about that in Boston, that our digital wholesale partners is a significant part of our growth in the next five years. Amazon is an important customer. And just we have -- some of our brands that have 1P relationships, we have some brands that have 3P relationships and we have some brands that have chosen to continue to look at and measure just how they could successfully work with Amazon more importantly here in the U.S marketplace long-term. I think it's fair to say, you will see The North Face open up a 3P partnership and have a trial going into fall '17 or you might even want to call that a pilot as we look at how to integrate Amazon into the long-term integrated marketplace strategy for The North Face here in the United States. We are working with Amazon in Europe and we will look at how we can do that here. But I\u2019d remind you there's a number of great players around the globe, AliBaba's, Orlando [ph], all of those are key wholesale partners for us long-term."]], ["I was actually a little surprised to see that it was still just a 2% estimate in your \u2013 the way that you're modeling it for the year on the impact to revenue for the year.

And yeah, some of them are positive like the euro and others not as much. But what we've done is we've looked about at the last 90 days and gone \u2013 projected that going forward.\nSo if the currencies, if the dollar continues to weaken, could that be a tailwind for us? Yeah, it could. But based on what we're seeing right now in our forward projections, we're not counting on that trend continuing. And it's slightly beneficial, but it's not material to the overall results.\nThe other thing I'd just remind everybody is about 80% of our transactional exposure is hedged. So from an in-country profitability standpoint, there is some variability, but not a lot."]], ["trends in the business here versus in Europe and Asia, where there seems to be a growing kind of separation.\nDo you feel like that some of the challenges in the U.S. ", ["I'll try to answer that question, Omar. Some of that is looking at a crystal ball. But what I would say, what we see in our international business, where really things are not necessarily that much easier, our brands are doing extremely well. The thoughtful approach to segmentation and really placing the right product collections in each of these distribution channel partners' doors. And how we're using our retail and digital platforms to build our brands' breadth and depth with consumer is helping us outperform the marketplace.\nHere in the U.S. it's clear that we've got ourselves in a really uneven and inconsistent performance. But there are retailers and there are brands that are doing well in this marketplace. We're going to settle through retail closures. We all read the same reports.\nBut I think the thing that we all need to really remember is that strong brands that have a very authentic connection with consumers, that are delivering unique products that provide consumers the opportunity to enjoy the experiences that they look for, position brands to succeed in this marketplace.\nWe'll navigate this because of the strength of our portfolio. And it's really the learnings that we take in our European and Asia markets that are helping us fine tune our approach to segmentation and the use of the various product collections in those channels that's giving us confidence that we'll navigate it.\nScott A. Roe - VF Corp.\nYeah. I'd just add on to that, Omar. There are some fundamental differences. The U.S., we all look at the same numbers, right? The U.S. is over-stored as a general statement, much more than what you would see in Europe and Asia. So that's one issue.\nAlso remember the relative time in market and maturity of our brands are less internationally. So we have a lot of room to run there, just from penetration and an expansion standpoint. So if you think about our business vis-\u00e0-vis those markets, that's how we look at it.\nAnd lastly, in the U.S., while its macro trends are certainly true, and again we've tried to say we will see disruption and choppiness as certain contractions and consolidations happen. There are clear winners out there, too, right? And we are winning with those winning retailers. And that's another reason why from a strategic standpoint, we've really pivoted and focused on our D2C and particularly our digital business.\nAnd you might remember from the Investor Day, 85% of our growth is coming from digital and digital partners. And of that 15% that's essentially in international.\nSo in the next five years, we're not expecting much on a net basis from wholesale in the U.S. We will be winning disproportionately with some vendors. And we're also expecting that there will be continued consolidation that's going to occur over the next five years"]], ["Where that kind of active lifestyle has shifted away maybe from that rugged outdoor aesthetic to more of the athletic, athleisure aesthetic and you just kind of have to wait for that cycle to play out? ", ["Omar, I mean, there's clearly a cycle that we're all seeing right now with the retro athletic. But to the point on Timberland, we absolutely believe we have the right strategy. And the proof point is what we see going on with our European business, who was much quicker to diversify across multiple franchises, specifically SensorFlex and the launch of AeroCore and have really brought down the percent to total of the boots, the total boot collection.\nWe were slow to do that here in the United States market. And that work is underway. Jim [Pisani] did I thought a good job really of being able to explain that at the Investor Day. That work is underway.\nConcurrently, we've really elevated our apparel product creation, sitting now in our Stabio office, leveraging the strength of our apparel machine there. We're really seeing that investment pay out in our European marketplace. As that starts to come here to the U.S., we have confidence that that will be a growth driver.\nBut we're also unlocking women's growth. And you'll remember the three focuses for Timberland are their men's business and the diversification across new franchises, women's and apparel. And again, the women's business and the strength that we're seeing with products designs in Europe that we're now bringing back into our Americas marketplace gives us confidence that we have the right product as we begin to be more diligent around segmentation and really diversifying those collections appropriately."]], ["I guess if sales in the second half \u2013 you're obviously planning for a big acceleration as well.\nSo if, whether it's environment or further bankruptcy, the sales weren't as high.

So we said about 14% operating margin. And with the margin expansion that would imply an increase in SG&A. And you see that's relatively higher in the first part. And we see \u2013 we leverage that in the second half, and it comes down.\nFirst of all, I'd say we have a pretty good line of sight to the second half of the year. Right? And so we're not expecting a tremendous volatility. We see our order book. We see the trends. Now there's always some variability possible. But we have a lot of confidence in the second half. So that's the first comment I'd make.\nSo secondly, we're also \u2013 we outlined a strategic plan in our Boston meeting. And we are investing behind those priorities. So the point I was trying to make by significant leverage is, obviously as the top line accelerates, we're going to see leverage, right, in the second half.\nWe're also taking a lot of \u2013 a hard look at all the nonstrategic SG&A. We have a transformation project that we're going on \u2013 that we're undertaking here. And I'd call it more of a philosophy than a project actually. And we're challenging every spend item that we have in the P&L and saying, if it's not directly related to bringing our strategy forward, then we're empowering our leaders to take a hard look at that.\nAnd the fruits of that labor are, we're going to \u2013 we're seeing and will continue to see leverage in those nonstrategic areas. Our thought is that is a fuel that we put right back and reinvest against those strategic priorities.\nSo again second, relative as the top line grows, we're going to see second half leverage. Remember in the first half we have a bit of a perfect storm. Right? We're opening our D2C \u2013 we're opening D2C stores. We see relative low wholesale growth for all the reasons that we detailed in our prepared remarks and some of the questions. We see that accelerating in the second half, and that's where you start to see that leverage."]], ["So like with wholesale revenues being down 4% and inventories I think were up 2%, can you talk about how like wholesale inventories are for you guys heading into the remainder of the year?

So from a Vans standpoint here in the U.S. \u2013 but it, really it applies to how the Vans businesses is managing itself across each of the regions \u2013 is just a really strong, broad, diversified set of products, starting first with footwear. And not depending on a single style but really leveraging the Classics and then there within Old Skool, bringing new innovations in their Pro Skate collection.\nWe're looking at new launches in apparel, launched a new Authentic Chino this spring, helped brought to market through our innovation platform. Just how we use the different franchises that we have across each of these apparel and footwear collections in their segmentation strategy. And how we bring those to life in our stores and digital I think really separates Vans from the rest of the marketplace.\nAnd it's their intense focus on their consumer and the focusing on those emotional elements of music, art, and street culture. And how we are connecting digitally with our consumers. Our customs platform, which we launched last year, continues to accelerate, as we expand (50:08) the offer and the means by which consumers can upload content to have us then transfer that onto footwear.\nThey're just bringing a lot of new ideas each season across each of these different categories of product. And doing it consistently across the globe and tying that to the experiences that they have through marketing and events, really separates them from the rest of the marketplace and I think kind of puts them in a category in many ways in their own right.\nScott A. Roe - VF Corp.\nYeah. And so, Bob, versus you \u2013 or kind of your inventory related question. So a couple things. Number one, we do have pretty good line of sight to the balance of the year. So as it relates to the quality of our inventory, we feel good about that. Right? We don't see any issues and from a quality standpoint.\nAlso remember that the marketplace is substantially cleaner as we look at it. Now there's a few \u2013 there's always a few pockets here and there. But as an overall statement, we would say that retail inventories are in good shape. And we don't see any issues on a go forward basis."]], ["One, within your guidance for Jeanswear and in general, how many store closures domestically do you have built in to like the current guidance and the five-year guidance?\nAnd then secondly, what gives you the confidence that the European influence will move appropriately to the U.S.?

But just generally, just to reorient the comments I made earlier. We're really not expecting in the five-year plan any net wholesale growth in the U.S.\nAnd within that we will see growth for sure, but we know it's going to be choppy. We may have a year where we see a little growth. Then we may see continued bankruptcies. And we're sure that's going to happen. We have modeled it behind the scenes. But that's not \u2013 for reasons I think you can appreciate, that's not something that we're going to talk about, what we're assuming on some of our customers in a public forum.\nJust know that again when you think about where is our growth going to come from? It's going to come from our D2C, our digital, and that includes our digital partners as well, and our international wholesale. That's what's driving the next five years from our standpoint.\nSteven E. Rendle - VF Corp.\nYes. Sam, we absolutely see further consolidation here in the U.S. market. And really we've built our plans with that in mind. And to Scott's point, that net neutral number wholesale here in the U.S. market.\nThe comment around Europe and the influence that we see from our international business, it's not necessarily style or designs that we have in those marketplaces. It's more the discipline around thoughtful segmentation, elevated product, really strong experiential marketing within our own environments and our wholesale partners, and the way our leadership teams, in specifically Europe, are driving the business in a very methodical, professional way. It's those disciplines and the need to elevate product, our focus around design and innovation, and what that means to product and brand experience, that's what I'd ask you to take away.\nAnd those disciplines being utilized across our business. It's the disciplines that sit within our Vans North America business here. It's one of the reasons they're so successful in putting together quarter after quarter positive results. It's taking that discipline, making sure it's well placed in each of our large brands, and just having the disciplined conversations to give us confidence in the long term sustainability of our growth.\nBut this is \u2013 to be honest with you, Sam, this is one of the reasons we made management changes, is to really get that leadership in place. The movement of Arne to our U.S. business, just bringing that focus, that leadership presence to these key brands gives us confidence that everything we've been talking about from a longer-term standpoint is absolutely within our line of sight."]], ["I mean you were very early to get on this trend of returning a significant amount of cash to shareholders and it\u2019s paid part in the fund.\nBut it has paid dividends in both the credibility of the business model as well as the relative performance of the stock, but why not more dividends over buybacks? ", ["Do you want to take it crack at it?\nDonna Titzman\nSure. So look we have told - we\u2019ve explained to the market that we do consider that dividend to be part of the nondiscretionary piece of our capital allocation. So when we look at that we look at it in the context of it being [attentive] [ph] to the market with our peers and the market in general, but also more importantly sustainable through market cycles. So again, we regularly review that with those objectives in mind.\nJoseph Gorder\nDoug, what I would - and Donna is exactly right. What I would add to what she said, you\u2019ve got the sustainability aspect in a down market cycle which is something that we spend a lot of time looking at to be sure that we don\u2019t find ourselves cutting the dividend. And you reinforce that by having a very strong balance sheet.\nBut if I think about it longer-term, okay, and this is really where my brain goes, it goes to the sustainability of the growth of the dividend going forward. And we want to continue to be able to grow.\nWe want to give our owners more every year. And the way that you go about doing that is tempering it a little bit. I think we started talking last year about moderating the dividend a little bit more, which I think you saw we did this year.\nAnd the other thing that\u2019s really encouraging from my perspective is it, we\u2019ve got these capital projects that are coming on stream. They are providing significant future earnings potential. And some of them are longer cash flow cycles, which we haven\u2019t done a lot over the last bunch of years, but I mean, we got another renewable diesel plant, we\u2019ve got the Coker.\nAnd then if we end up doing the Port Arthur renewable diesel plant in the future. These are huge EBITDA producing projects, which are going to really reinforce our ability to go ahead and continue to deliver dividend growth going forward.\nNow, I\u2019m not making you a promise, because Lord only knows what might happen, but that would be our objective. And that\u2019s kind of the way we look at investing our capital.\nThe component part, the percentage of the total payout that\u2019s made up of the dividend, that the dividend comprises, that\u2019s not formulaic. It\u2019s more us looking at all of the factors involved. And there\u2019s a lot of sausage-making that takes place there that we won\u2019t get into here.\nBut I always want to be in a position when we do something like this to let you know that we feel fairly assured that this isn\u2019t going to be an issue going forward."]], ["But certainly your capture suggests that\u2019s not the right direction to be looking in.\nAnd furthermore once you\u2019ve hopefully helped explain how come you\u2019re running at the levels that you are right across the system, could you - and this is a follow-up to the previous question.

So, Paul we\u2019ll look - we\u2019re kind of looking at each other let us give -- take a crack at this and then we\u2019ll give you the opportunity if we\u2019re not answering your question to follow-up. Okay.\nLane Riggs\nHey, Paul. This is Lane. I\u2019ll start. We\u2019ve had a long strategy really dating back to 2011 to work in a very organized way on our reliability projects and what we\u2019ve seen is our refining system has gone from say 95% to 96% availability all the way up to sort of over 97% availability and that\u2019s helped us. We\u2019re available when the market\u2019s right and been able to perform better.\nAnd in addition to that we do believe that we\u2019re the best in the industry in terms of understanding what feedstocks go where in the systems that we\u2019re in and we\u2019re highly adaptable to that. So, I think that helps us versus some other people in terms of our capture rates."]], ["I mean I guess further to a previous question, we\u2019ve seen big mega oil so you would think have a similar structure in terms of the refining footprint to you guys wildly underperforming against what you guys are achieving. ", ["Well, we appreciate you saying that Paul.\nLane Riggs\nYes, thank you.\nJoseph Gorder\nAnd then the follow-up question was on capacity?\nLane Riggs\nYes. So, I think the situation in the Far East is just developing. And it\u2019s really too early for us to be able to judge the magnitude of the impact that\u2019s going to have and whether it leads to refinery shutting down or not.\nJoseph Gorder\nThe reality of it is we\u2019ve got capacity coming on stream. We\u2019ve also got capacity that isn\u2019t running well and that in the foreseeable future probably won\u2019t be able to run well. And so - and Paul if you assume at some point it\u2019s a zero-sum game, there\u2019s going to be a lot of capacity that shouldn\u2019t run.\nCertainly - and I have a post-IMO world it\u2019s going to have an effect on that. And so if you got poorly performing assets today, turning them around is a lengthy process. And then if you\u2019ve got a marginal asset due to economics, you\u2019re going to be the guy that has to bow at some point in time.\nSo that\u2019s why we look at it. I mean frankly our tendency is to focus a whole lot more on our business and what we can do to make it better and more efficient than kind of what\u2019s happening more broadly."]], ["And at the time when we were at that peak, it seemed obvious why but in retrospect IMO is having more of a feedstock effect than a product effect.\nSo do you have any updated thoughts about that period just three months ago when diesel cracks were peaking in retrospect. ", ["Yes, Sam. So I think as we got to the back half of the fourth quarter, obviously fall turnaround season winded down and we started to see refinery utilization ramp up and with higher refinery utilization of course distillate production increased.\nAnd then overall, demand has been weaker than what we anticipated. So a lot of that\u2019s been due to warmer weather. The warmer weather is somewhat offset, a lot of the demand increase we thought we would get as a result of IMO.\nIn addition to that, certainly in the U.S. Gulf Coast we\u2019ve had a very heavy fog, which has limited our ability to export the diesel to some of the export markets. In addition to that we\u2019ve had very high freight rates, which again hinder our ability to export. Of course, South America is a big export market for us. They\u2019ve had a lot of rain in South America, which has delayed the harvest. So again having a hit to demand.\nAnd then I think the final thing is there was a lot of pre stocking of very low sulfur fuel oil that happened in the industry. And so, so far it\u2019s muted the impact that IMO will have. We certainly are confident that that demand will show up but it would be more of a second quarter type demand increase than what we\u2019re seeing so far in the first quarter."]], ["But there were some headlines recently around the court cases around RINs exemptions and a small waiver, the waivers for some of the smaller refiners from a couple of years ago.

And what it did was vacated SREs for three refineries, two of all the frontiers and one of CVRs. And the EPA has several options, including appeal, expect they will probably will appeal, like neither appeal and have the Tenth Circuit that - hear the case as a whole or go straight to the Supreme Court and we know they\u2019re evaluating their options to see.\nSo court took a reading of the statute a fairly constrained view that as far as I know has been done by court in the past but it\u2019s definitely not in keeping with the view the judge had at the way they\u2019ve interpreted the statute in the past. So we really have to see what the judge does with it to get an idea of how impactful this is.\nOne important point is because it was at the circuit of the DC circuit, which is a decision the clients made and when they filed it, it\u2019s only has legal effect within the circuit. So it only binds the EPA within those six states that are covered by the DC circuit. So let\u2019s see how it evolves.\nJoseph Gorder\nYeah, we\u2019ll see how it plays out.

And so our focus really has been to make sure that we\u2019re connected to all of these lines coming out of the Permian and we can take barrels to Corpus or Three Rivers.\nAnd then we\u2019ve also put effort into expanding our dock capacity from our Corpus Christi refinery. So part of that project is completed. By early second quarter we\u2019ll have that project 100% completed and essentially double our export capacity that we\u2019ll be able to put through our system.\nThe second part of your question, yes, I would expect it to really affect the MEH posting first.

Outside of that, I don\u2019t know what else I would add.\nLane Riggs\nRoger, I want to add one line. I\u2019ll just add one thing. I think what you\u2019re really seeing is as we alluded to; we\u2019re marketing for low sulfur VGO and low sulfur ATV into the low sulfur fuel oil market. And then what that does is that really is constructed for SEC - for gasoline because SEC are going to be cut.\nI mean, we\u2019ve sort of talked about it over the past really for the last two years when we were talking about IMO and that part of it is certainly playing out. I mean you\u2019ll see as the gasoline season rolls in, you\u2019ll get a - essentially that market is going to have to compete for feed that\u2019s into the gasoline market. So, it should be supportive of both really sort of both gasoline and diesel."]], ["And I know there\u2019s been some changes in the consolidation of VLP and all that.\nBut I was just curious is that something that can be a help on the OpEx side that we should see?

That\u2019s sort of our large turnaround timeframe.\nAnd so I would just sort of say that\u2019s flat year-over-year. But when you look at the longer term, certainly, we\u2019ve had realignment reporting structures. We moved the renewable in the Diamond Green Diesel out and we\u2019ve taken all the MLP stuff which would have been in our sort of cost of goods and it came into our OpEx. And so as we realigned all that stuff it sort of resulted in a little bit in terms of our OpEx a little bit higher.\nAnd then overall there are - obviously there\u2019s some inflationary pressures in the world.

", ["Yes. Well, those are two very different questions. One is do we think it matters from an ES&G perspective and I think it definitely does. We have a very clear view of what -- where things are going and what the world is demanding now. And we really believe renewable fuel is a key component of that. And the good news is that they both happen to be great businesses and we\u2019ve got great assets and good teams.\nSo, I think as time goes on, people will see that Valero somewhat differentiated perhaps from others out there because of these investments. As far as separating them off, my view is they are producers of motor fuels and different types of motor fuels, very low carbon intensity motor fuels, but they\u2019re motor fuels and Valero produces motor fuels.\nThat\u2019s what our business is and we do it really well. And these are largely process operations and they integrate well, processes that we\u2019ve implemented on the refining side are scalable to our ethanol plants and to the renewable diesel operations. And so I think frankly being embedded in the company, it brings more value to Valero that it would just split it out."]], ["And then other factor, another question is just a follow-up on the ethanol, that\u2019s a smaller segment, but I just wanted to get a sense of how you see the next couple of quarters playing out?

What the issue has been is oversupply in the U.S. right. Inventory is just too low, which is pressuring margins. The production is trending lower, ethanol inventory now on the weekly data is 2.5 million barrels lower than this time last year.\nAnd then long-term, we\u2019re still bullish. Ethanol is going to be in the U.S. gasoline mix for the long run. We expect to see some small incremental demand in the U.S. from higher octane and fuel efficiency standards and some small incremental demand from year round E15 sales. And then we expect, really the big thing we expect is a rebound and the export growth due to favorable blend economics, just the economics to blending ethanol and then these global renewable fuel mandates.

And to the extent you could use credits, you defer the capital, but now we're getting to the point where the rubber meets the road, and it's going to be a lot of makeup activity or we are going to see this spread continue to expand."]], ["Second question would just be around the grade of crude that's going to be coming down those pipelines, a lot more of the West Texas light that everyone has been talking about. ", ["Yes. So, Phil, it's just all a matter of price. We have plenty of capacity to be able to process the barrel. Historically, we've seen a lot of the light material that makes its way to the Gulf price such that we don't have an economic incentive to run it, and it goes to the export market. Some of the WTL that's been making its way to Corpus has been pricing at $1.25 type discount to MEH. And so, we've seen some incentive to buy it. And if that's the case, we certainly have a lot of capacity to run it, but it will depend on how its prices."]], ["So, I just wonder if you could kind of give us an idea of how that's happened because it seems a little contrary to the kind of the conventional wisdom, run more lights, get more gasoline? ", ["Yes. So, Roger, what I would say is we did have the FCC down in Houston -- the whole FCC Houston alky complex was down from -- a big chunk of the quarter, so consequently, our gasoline production was off. In terms of naphtha, we are -- again, with the signal's been max reformer the whole time. So, as you increment into the light sweet, it leads to us, and I believe the industry is in the same spot, as you run more and more light sweet, more of it has to be exported, and ultimately, it clears in the Far East. And so, it doesn't go in the gasoline. Now there will be, and I'm sure part of what's happening right now with this Tier 3 is saturating the gasoline and lowering octane and there's just an abundance of naphtha, everybody is trying to figure out a way to get naphtha back into the gasoline pool. But you need octane to do that. And right now, the industry is trying to get that -- figure out that balance as again, as Tier 3 is getting acclimated."]], ["You did the acquisition -- I don't remember if it closed into the very beginning of the year or very end of last year, but it's been a tough period here in ethanol. ", ["Roger, this is Martin. Yes. If you look at the -- this is the latest corn crop really in the history of the record, which goes back 40 years. So, you've got the latest corn crop and right now, so the December CBOT price was $3.70 a bushel in early May, went to $4.70 a bushel by mid-June. Now it's back down to about $4.30. So, there's just a lot of uncertainty how big is the crop. And what really matters is the carryout at the end of this 2019 crop year. And nobody knows at this point. There's still weather that could impact it. So, it's going to be hard to have real big ethanol margins for this crop here in the U.S. Now obviously if China opens up, that helps a lot. That's a little different story, right. They have a 10% mandate, and that would make a big difference on the exports right away. Absent that, you're going to see -- you saw our forward guidance is lower than we ran. So, we're going to trim a little bit. A lot of people are going to have to trim more. We've got a great fleet. In the long term, when you're relying on a crop, these things happen, right? We've had five years now where yields have been above trend and then due for one below it. So, we'll get through this. Obviously, we're still bullish about ethanol. Long term, it's a great octane component. It's part of the fuel mix to stay, so we'll be there with it.\nJoseph Gorder\nTwo things I would add to what Martin said. First of all, the industry is just overproduced for what it is today. That's the fundamental problem here. So, what have we done? Well, we have ramped up exports as an industry, and that's where tariffs become a factor in these things. And it takes a while in the developed markets, but we have been, Valero has been very aggressive in exporting ethanol and we'll continue to be aggressive going forward. The other thing, and Jason spoke to this earlier, was the whole E15 issue. The ethanol industry broadly has this notion allowing E15, which as we said will be challenged, is going to solve some of this problem. Frankly, I think the solution to this problem is a higher octane fuel that helps with CAFE, and it could be a nationwide standard like 95 RON. It would require more ethanol to be blended into the fuel mix. It would take all the arguments out of what types of fuel we're going to produce in market broadly. And if we could just get everybody synced up. This is one of the things where amazingly, the autos are on board, the retail marketers are on board, refiners are okay with this. And in the ethanol industry, we've seen that this was a good solution to this problem that we're facing. Perhaps we could make some progress, but there is a genuine distrust, and we're going to have to get over that. But we will continue to bash away on this, because I agree with Martin. Ethanol is going to be part of the fuel mix for a very long time, and it will recover."]], ["If I'm doing my math right, it looks like you've spent about $1.5 billion so far out of the $2.5 billion 2019 target, which implies to me that your spending is going to drop off into the second half of the year. ", ["It's both. This is Lane. It's both of those. We've had a pretty heavy turnaround period, and we don't have nearly as much turnaround activity for the rest of the year. And then two, you're just not as productive those last 2 or 3 months of the year because of all the holidays. So, it's really a combination of that.\nJoseph Gorder\nYes. It's not that unusual to find ourselves in this situation. I mean, and things will move a little bit within this. Sometimes we're slightly below, sometimes we're above, but I mean, the $2.5 billion number is just kind of our nominal expectation what we're going to spend. And again, you kind of do it as you have to, so.\nLane Riggs\nWell, and to that point, I mean, when we had the tube leak at Benicia, that was the turnaround that we had planned in the first quarter of 2020, that we had to bring into this year. So, we had to bring on a number -- $80 million or $90 million of turnaround spend from one year to the next. And so, some things like that can happen."]], ["So, I wonder if it's a matter of months those imports kind of hit the East Coast, margins are going to fall back off or maybe there is somewhat of an octane shortage that could support gasoline margins through the rest of 3Q? ", ["Yes. So, this is Gary. I think our view is, if you look at the DOE stats for the last couple of weeks, it looks like demand has been down. But our view is that demand will be revised back upward and that you'll see actually net exports fall off. And a lot of that is the reason that you pointed to. After the fire and announced closure, you had a $0.03 a gallon open ARB to ship gasoline from Northwest Europe to New York Harbor. And so, its incentivized imports there. PADD 5 we saw imports even after the refinery utilization came back. And then in the U.S. Gulf Coast, with the octane strength, we're seeing some import of components into the U.S. Gulf Coast as well. And so, demand is good, but the net exports, mainly due to imports being down, is kind of what's caused the build that we've seen the last couple weeks. And it does look like that the market is cooling off some, and you're already seeing signs that that's reversing, especially in PADD 5. We've gone from seeing imports to it looks like a couple refiners are putting export cargos together, and you're seeing barrels from California flow into the Arizona market to help clear that as well. So, I do think it's a trend you'll see reverse."]], ["Is Valero thinking of kind of continuing its strategy to push its logistical reach into new markets, similar to what it did in Peru to kind of combat the potential for the Mexican market to close up a bit to the U.S. ", ["Yes. So, we currently are exporting about -- that we sell ourself about 30,000 barrels a day direct sales into Mexico. That will continue to ramp up. We're building our marine terminal in Veracruz and have a strategy in the North as well. For Mexico to do much on revamping their refining system, it involves a lot. It's not just the refineries, but it's also a lot of logistics and able to get logistics that were meant to move crude out, now to move crude in. So, it's going to be a long time coming before they can do much in terms of revamping their refining system.\nJoseph Gorder\nYes. I agree with Gary completely. And then if you look at the new plant that they have in mind, obviously, the capital cost is going to be much higher than they had originally forecasted. If you are a country and you want to do something as a matter of national pride, and economic returns aren't the primary driver to the investment, then something like that probably makes sense. But certainly, the most efficient way for Mexico to supply its shorts is from the U.S. Gulf Coast."]], ["I wanted two parts to this question, one wanted to know kind of a check on how much Canadian you were running in the quarter and what your thoughts are going forward? ", ["Yes. Prashant, good question. Gary, you and Lane want to take.\nGary Simmons\nYes. So we did just under 190,000 barrels a day of heavy Canadian, 49 of that was crude by rail that we delivered to Port Arthur with the remainder being pipeline delivered barrels. We would expect those volumes to continue in that range actually ramp up a little bit especially with the Venezuelan barrels off of the market. On the Maya formula, there's not a lot of help in terms of additional medium and heavy sour supply coming onto the market, but where we see the opportunity for the quality dips to improve is really heavy, high sulfur fuel moving weaker. And we came off the highs, where we were trading at 96% of Brent. Earlier this week, we were down to 89% of Brent. And our expectation is as you move closer to that IMO 2020 fuel spec change that high sulfur fuel would continue to get weaker and that will help the quality discounts move weaker as well."]], ["It seems like from where I'm sitting, the EPA is a little bit more moderated with headlines of them signaling took and can issue less small refinery waivers and potentially walking back the proposal to freeze their CAFE standards. ", ["This is Jason, again. And we hadn't seen them really ship their approach. They're definitely under pressure probably under constant pressure from the ethanol side. On the smaller farther waivers they have been for years, but they seemed to understand that the responsibility to grant smaller final exemptions is part of the statute, it's been reaffirmed by Congress and the court several times, have been several appellate cases on the issue. And so, we're encouraged by administrator Wheeler's comments at his confirmation hearing that he plan to follow the law. He understood how those programs are supposed to work and we hope the agency continues to act as they have in the past which is to grant the waivers where they seem to be appropriate."]], ["I mean not weak by any standard, but it was just one of you can dive in a little bit what you're seeing in terms of diesel or distillate demand both here in the U.S. ", ["Sure. Yes. I think we had a little milder winter in the North Atlantic basin than what we typically had which hurt demand a little bit. That was certainly offset by lower production with the lower refinery utilization. I think moving forward certainly you're entering a time of the year where we typically see a little softer distillate demand as you don't have the heating oil demand. I think where this year is different with the market structure and the strong carry in the market, I think the [indiscernible] market will remain supported because as it weakens the barrels will be bid into storage. And so I think you'll see diesel continue to be supportive in the short-term and then you'll get the demand kick later in the year as we approach the IMO 2020 date."]], ["And then, this is a -- it's been a recurring theme now for a while that you MidCon segments really starting to break out and capture versus historical rates are -- is up a lot. ", ["There's two pieces to that question, right. There's the -- I mean the conversation around strategic use of the pipeline. But I mean, our initial emphasis for the pipeline was to assure crude supply in a particular crude supply into the Memphis refinery. You guys want to talk about that at all.\nGary Simmons\nYes. That's gone extremely well. And we saw a stronger contribution of Diamond Pipeline in the first quarter '19 than we did in the first quarter of '18 and some of that's the water Brent TIR. The other change in our system was the Sunrise Pipeline which came online in the fourth quarter of '18. That not only improved our ability to get Midland Cushing, Midland barrels to Ardmore and McGee, but we are now able to get Midland barrels to Memphis and we certainly saw an uplift from that in the first quarter. Now, I'll let Rich handle the second part."]], ["I guess the first is, you had a number of organic projects that have come online over the course of last year and so just trying to think about what the earnings power would have been in the first quarter independent of some of those growth projects so we can isolate the growth on a commodity agnostic basis.

Well, obviously, okay, I think the refinery, we only have the Wilmington and Cajon.\nGary Simmons\nYes. So the Sunrise definitely had a material impact on the first quarter results for us as you were able to capture that Midland to Cushing differential on the pipeline was space we have on Sunrise.\nLane Riggs\nNeil, there's been a host of things though right. I mean we've got the Diamond Green Diesel expansion that we're seeing the benefits of also. And you've seen it multiple times but in the deck, we've got the fact that we believe that the projects that were completed produced another $340 million of incremental EBITDA. So, we -- if you compare year-over-year and how we performed in kind of a similar margin environment, I think you would find that the projects have contributed significantly to the earnings capability of the company.\nJoe Gorder\nOver pipeline projects and then the Diamond Green Diesel expansion.\nLane Riggs\nRight."]], ["I think, there was some perception maybe with the project sanction last year that there would be upward pressure, and we're actually seeing a $200 million decrease year-over-year, and that sustained into 2020. ", ["This is Lane. I wouldn't call it deflation, I would call that we had a -- we had a lot of sustaining capital with respect to Tier 3 and plus the reliability project at our Corpus Christi refinery in 2018. Our run rate is like what we've said is normally about $1.5 billion to sustain our assets. We had a little bit more than that in this past year. And there's obviously timing involved and all that. Whether our turnarounds get a little bit lumpy or again we end up having to do something a little bit special on some environmental, currently we don't have anything on our forward view of that."]], ["But then, I guess more importantly, I\u2019m just curious, in order to replace those barrels, are you looking to resort to more light sweet domestic crudes or just largely maxed out on light sweet to where you're actually going to have to resort to the global market for kind of medium and heavy sour replacement barrels? ", ["Yes. Blake, this is Gary. Of course, with the sanctions, we're currently not taking anything from Venezuela. But, it was about 20% of our heavy sour that we run was Venezuelan barrels historically. We're certainly hopeful that we\u2019ll see proper resolution to the crisis, not only for the benefit of the crude markets but for the welfare of the people of Venezuela. We've seen production decline in Venezuela for years, and we've also known there was a threat of sanctions. So, we\u2019ve put alternatives in place to be prepared for this. Of course, the announcement was just made Monday; we've only had 48 hours to respond.\nOur top priority really has been to get to next 30-day supply plan covered. And I can tell you we're in a lot better position today than we were on Tuesday, but we still have some holes to fill in our supply plan. We really run Venezuelan barrels at two of our refineries in the Gulf, St. Charles and Port Arthur. The St. Charles refinery did begin a turnaround on their crude and coker unit. So, that definitely minimizes the impacts that the sanctions had on our system.\nTo your point, current economics are certainly pushing us to maximize light sweet in the system."]], ["It's funny, we're 40 minutes since the call and it's got a lot less tense than probably six months ago, which is a reflection perhaps of what you've seen in the forward curve where we\u2019ve seen diesel FO; while it's still favorable, has compressed in 2020, 2021. ", ["Sure, Neil. This is Gary. I don't think our view of what will transpire as a result of IMO 2020 has really changed at all. We still see that you'll see a significant uptick in diesel demand and you'll see weakness in the high sulfur fuel oil markets. The shape of the high sulfur fuel curve is pretty much as we assumed it would be. The starting point is a little higher with high sulfur fuel oil trading 94% of Brent today, but you still see steep backwardation in high sulfur fuel oil curve. I think, the one to us that we keep staring at is the ULSD forward curve really isn't showing any IMO impact at all. And we still believe there will be significant demand increases as a result of IMO and strong diesel cracks as a result of that as you approach that January 2020 date."]], ["How do you expect things to progress in some of those things through 2019, and how different is the environment even in January compared to this very good result in Q4? ", ["So, Paul, I mean, that's a very good question. And you hit on the point. I mean, it is a very interesting market because there are so many moving parts right now. But, the thing that we always have to keep in mind is that January always stinks. Gasoline is usually weak at this point in time. If the winter is warm, distillates not too salty. A lot of times, Paul, we've been at your conference in the past in January when everybody wanted to slip their risk because things were so miserable. Right? But the reality is, is that we're managing our business for the long term. And we have been in this for a very long time and we understand the cycles in the business.\nAnd so what do you do? You make adjustments day-in and day-out in your operations to try to deal with this and to be as profitable as possible. I mean, Lane mentioned some of the things we'll do around cash. Gary has changed in the way he's sourcing crude, on a weekly, daily basis to try to get the best net-back that we can in the plant.\nThe things that we don't change. We don't change our commitment to the things that make Valero really good, which is operating safely, reliably, honoring environmental stewardship, managing our capital appropriately. Those are the things we can control and that we pay a lot of attention to. Day-in and day-out optimization based on certain market conditions, okay, we're all over that too. But, we don't have a crystal ball. And so we just manage the business for the long-term and we do our best. Lane, you or Gary, want to talk any specifics around that?\nLane Riggs\nOne thing I would add on Venezuela, Venezuela at some point going to have to put oil on the market, even if these sanctions stay in place. So, there's going to be a balancing time through here where whoever buy any alternatives, they'll build buy Venezuelan oil and oil will come to our market. So, I mean, it will also allow you just sort of in a interim time period here where that's got to play out. And of course, if something changes in Venezuela, then it's just back to status quo. On OPEC, OPEC is clearly going to be looking at trying to set the amount of oil in the market based on what are the markets and what's the structure of the market. And again, as Joe alluded to, every day we wake up and we do -- we optimize our assets around what's available out there. We have a great system better than anyone in the markets to get the most value and understand these markets."]], ["I have to apologize that first question is somewhat similar to what Roger just asked on the IMO, but I want to focus that, Jason, you guys have a lot of contact in DC and in the White House and all.

And one thing we shouldn't do is read too much into this one story with an anonymous source from the administration as being a statement of their policy. From our discussions, we don't think the administration has reached or formed conclusions yet.\nThey all understand the economic impact of the potential changes, but there is nothing yet. Now the word was, they were supporting that experienced building phase and in that context or it seemed to be that it would lead to some type of delay or lax enforcement upfront, but looks like that was very clearly shut down within the committee. Importantly, we were told the U.S. delegation actually supported this conclusion of basically morphing that proposal into something that only dealt with data-gathering. So I think it's an ongoing discussion. They don't have a firm commitment yet or firm position yet and they're just trying to understand the situation."]], ["And then maybe as a final, after the roll in of the VLP, will the reporting format of the companies be changed that you just roll everything into refining and no longer report VLP or logistic result on a separate item?

Maya question, certainly the volatility between Brent and WTI in the Midland Cushing spread along with fuel getting strengthened has wreaked havoc on the Maya formula and so we would certainly say that Maya is not priced competitively in the market today. We had several conversations with PMI. I think they are well aware that their barrels are not been priced competitively into the U.S. Gulf Coast and they will make adjustments as we move forward.\nI also think that Maya is not really as relevant of a marker for heavy sour crude as it used to be. Certainly in our system, the only heavy sour barrels that we buy that are priced off the Maya formula are the barrels that we get from Mexico. The remainder of the barrels are not priced off of Maya. Today, Canadian heavy barrel and the U.S. Gulf Coast has $8 to $10 advantage over Maya. So, we still see a good incentive to push heavy sour crudes into our refining systems but I would agree, Maya is not priced competitively today.\nJoseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.\nAnd then I guess the next question was, Paul your fourth, was relative to...\nDonna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.\nThe segment reporting question. Yeah.

", ["Sure. This is Gary. I think, basically demand is kind of where we'd expected it to be going into this year. You've had a little bit of demand growth compared to last year, about 1%. The real surprise, especially on the gasoline side is just very high refinery utilization, so. And year-to-date, we've averaged 93% refinery utilization, 2.6% higher than where we were last year. With that increase in refinery utilization, gasoline production is up about 2% over where it was last year. And even though you've had an increase in demand you've had about 2 to 1 increase in production over demand, and it's caused a surplus in the inventory build.\nAs we move into the fourth quarter, I think you've seen gasoline cracks get very weak. Some of that is typically as you move out of driving season, you see weaker demand for gasoline. And then you also have the potential to even slow the gasoline production further as you move out into RVP transition and get butane into the pool."]], ["whether they pulled out or not, does it really come down to the penalties or the enforcement mechanism which could ultimately be eased if \u2013 as one method of a kind of work around.

That's the key component and historically the U.S. has been one of the most zealous enforcers of MARPOL through the Coast Guard and the EPA.\nAnd think about how shipping works and like I said all shipping within the U.S. is already covered by the tighter sulfur spec, which we seem to be fine with the 0.1% in the ECA. The only other shipping that's involved is stuff going to and from the U.S., and if the U.S. didn't want to enforce it especially now that we have the Carriage rule in place, the flag state would have authorities to enforce it and wherever that ships, the other end of the voyage, right, where it's coming to and from, that port state would also be able to enforce it, and has the Carriage rule to help it. So, you'd say even if the U.S. chose not to enforce, which would be very uncharacteristic of us, there should still be a lot of mechanisms in place to do it."]], ["It's maybe one for Gary, but whoever wants to chime in, our understanding is that there's a broad consensus, Europe \u2013 let's face it, this is the best thing to happen to European refineries in 20 years.

I think, the only other comment I would make is that our Qu\u00e9bec refinery, the way we have that refinery configured, it makes a \u2013 have a very high distillate yield for the kind of crude that it runs. The only time you get into a market where the gasoline crack is depressed in relation to the heat crack that refinery will perform very, very well. And as we all know, I mean, the heat crack has sort of being outperforming the gas crack here of late.

We're certainly ramping up our rail volume some. We did about 30,000 barrels a day in the third quarter. We expect to get that up to 40,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter.\nAnd then it looks like there's some additional rail being dedicated to that market early next year. But I think before you see a meaningful shift in the Western Canadian differentials, you're going to have to have one of the pipeline projects done.

", ["Yeah. You bet. I'll take the first part and I'll let Donna take the second part. But if you go back to the original plan with VLP, we've used the MLP structure and its lower cost to capital to develop projects that supported Valero's core business. And whenever we did a project at VLP or at Valero for subsequent drop to VLP, it was always with a, does it benefit Valero and help integration into supply chain going forward. So that was where we started. Okay.\nWe got it out there. We have this great base of logistics assets that we could drop down and opportunities enable us to provide the MLP investor with a clear line of sight to ratable growth. We had a sub 3% yield on VLP's equity and we were executing as promised. Then the MLP markets appetite changed significantly from a drop-down driven high-growth sponsored MLP equity to a self-funded low growth model with corporate and governance rights. And the cost of capital was also higher than that at VLO. So we looked at this for a year or more. We're very patient. We watched carefully for any catalyst change that would support a shift back to our original design and we saw none. So we looked at every available option.\nWe agreed that the best outcome for both Valero Energy and the VLP owners was the buy-in. VLP unitholders get a premium to the average trading in the market and VLO stockholders get an accretive transaction. So it was a win-win, which are very hard to find and it's dealt with a problem we've got or that we had, which was that we had an entity out there that we needed to retain control over and we weren't able to grow it. So, Donna, do you to take the second piece?\nDonna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.\nYes. In regard to the other option that we've...\nJoseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.\nYeah.\nDonna M. Titzman - Valero Energy Corp.\n\u2013 we've looked at so a lot of talks in the market had been about eliminating the IDRs, you know, unfortunately that doesn't solve the underlying issue of being able to fund growth because you still wouldn't have access to the equity market. Some other options that we've seen MLP's chose are converting to C corps. As Joe mentioned these assets are key to us, and maintaining control over them is absolutely key to support a lot of our primary refineries and we didn't want to put the MLP into a structure that jeopardize Valero maintaining control over those assets.\nSo we looked at a lot of different options as Joe indicated. We took our time doing so. We have spent the last year also looking at all of this \u2013 all of the options at whether or not we really thought the MLP equity market would recover at anytime soon and we kept coming back to buying in was the best solution for both the unitholders and the shareholders of Valero.\nJoseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.\nYou know, Brad, it's interesting in that every solution that one might consider is unique to their individual circumstances. And somebody else might choose to do it differently. VLP was small enough and it afforded us this opportunity. If it was huge, we probably wouldn't have had the opportunity to do something like this or we would've had to do it differently.

I think we generally provided ranges that we thought were with our capital ranges and we're not deviating from that. So that's not going to change. I would say that the timing of these opportunities \u2013 acquisitions are always opportunistic. And so Martin and his team did a good thorough evaluation with Rich's team on the ethanol plants and we had a willing seller. And so we had an opportunity to buy at numbers that were very attractive relative to deals we've looked at over the last couple of years.\nThe VLP buy-in, it was just timely for us to do that. Again, we were patient. I mean it could have happened in June, right, but we wanted to wait and see if the market changed. When we finally concluded that we had a basically a broken equity out there and this VLP wasn't going to do for VLO what we expected it to do, it's time to move on and get out of it.

", ["Yeah. Roger, that's great. We'll let Gary go ahead and take a whack at these.\nGary Simmons - Valero Energy Corp.\nOkay. Roger, I think you know on the diesel side, much like Joe commented in his opening remarks, demand remains very strong both domestically and to the export markets. Domestically, we're seeing about 125,000 barrels a day of demand growth. So despite the fact that we've had record high refinery utilization and distillate production that's above the five-year average range, we really haven't been able to replenish diesel inventories to pre-hurricane type levels. So we continue to see very low diesel inventories, very strong export demand and very strong domestic demand.\nSo moving forward into the third quarter, I think you see some production fall off as we get into turnaround season and refineries come down for turnarounds. And then, of course, as you get later in the year, you'd expect to see some improvement in demand as heating oil season kicks in with some colder weather. So, to me, I think diesel should even be stronger in the prompt market, but when you look at the fundamentals, I think we're in for a very strong diesel year.\nOn the gasoline side, again, gasoline demand looks good domestically and into the export markets. Here with the record-high refinery utilization and increase in gasoline production, gasoline production increases are outpacing the increases in demand a little bit, so we've been able to replenish gasoline inventories to kind of a pre-hurricane type level.\nAs we move forward in the gasoline markets, like diesel, I think you'll see production fall off some with turnaround season. But assuming you don't have some interruption in supply like we saw last year with the hurricanes, I would expect gasoline to follow more seasonal trends, and once you get through driving season through Labor Day and demand falls off a little bit, you'll see gasoline cracks weaken as we get into the fourth quarter.\nOn your crude question, we continue to see good availability in crudes despite declining production in Venezuela. We continue to get above our contract levels there. Seeing good supply from Canada. North American growth continues to exceed expectations and then we're starting to see more OPEC volume make its way to the United States as well."]], ["And I just wanted to get your updated perspectives because it seems that bunker fuel associations and others around the world are starting to talk about what the real challenges are going to be of meeting the 1/1/20 date and particularly the pivot back towards scrubber options amongst other things.

Overall, we still believe that the West Coast has long refining capacity. And so as long as all the refineries are running at high utilization rates, the market really can't absorb all the production. But when the refinery goes down, you see spikes in the market and the market becomes short.\nI think longer term, the things I look to that can help that market is really the opening up and deregulation in Mexico. I think you will see exports from the West Coast that will go to the west side of Mexico. And then, you'll also see is some of the cross-border sales ramp up, in markets like El Paso you will start to see some more West Coast barrels serving the Arizona market which will help bring that market back into balance."]], ["Just wanted to get your sense or longer term thoughts in addressing that where there might be sourcing there or is that something that we should just be sort of expecting intermediate terms to still be a little bit scarcer?

Some of those grades we would push out if the Canadian was more economic.\nFollow-up, I guess, in Venezuela, we've certainly seen some issues with production and issues around logistics. But for the most part, the volumes we got for Venezuela in the first quarter were consistent with what our historical volumes have been.

We were \u2013 and the reason we were able to do that is because we were buying a number of intermediate feedstocks in lieu of crude. So that set the size.

Although production has been declining in Venezuela, our volumes have remained fairly constant versus our term contracts.\nWe attribute this to the fact that although production is declining, refinery utilization is down in Venezuela and so it's kind of keeping exports available to us.\nOn the crude dif side, we\u2019ve seen some pretty good swings. Obviously, the Western Canadian market is very discounted. WCS and Hardisty this morning is $34 under Brent. And then I think some of the turnaround activity and cold weather in the Gulf has caused the medium sour market at least in the U.S. Gulf Coast a week in some with asking operating close to 580 off of Brent.\nSo, seeing pretty good quality discounts. It doesn't seem to be quite keeping with either the Western Canadian or the medium sour values that we're seeing in the Gulf today.\nIn terms of access, we have good pipeline access really for our Houston area refineries where we don't have as good access as to St. Charles.

So that will take up a bigger piece of our 40% to 50% of the target. Now, as our taxes is reduced through tax reform, this amount of available cash flow will increase, and it will -- we'll continue to evaluate that through our capital allocation process as Joe talked about. And it will compete with growth investments and M&A and cash returns.\nJoe Gorder\nDoug, when you think about it, I mean, and this has been a consistent question that we received for several years. Are we buying back shares at 50? Is it too high? Are we buying back shares at 60? Is that too high? And here we are we find ourselves kind of in the mid-90s and is that too high.\nFrankly, I think our view would be that we remain undervalued, and the paradigm on independent refining is shifting. We are much more focused certainly Valero is on producing free cash flow and maintaining capital discipline around the use of funds.\nAnd to the extent that we continue to throw off significant amounts of free cash flow, we're going to have the opportunity to continue to buy back our shares and create higher lows and higher highs in the stock price.\nSo, if you ask me personally, if I think we're overvalued today, I would say the answer is no.

Yeah, this is Jason. You all probably saw this letter Administrator Pruitt sent to these Midwestern senators, here in the last week about potential changes to the RFS that the EPA was looking at. In the letter, he said they decided they weren't going to move the point of obligations. They weren't going to lower the biodiesel volumes under the notice they were looking at, and they weren't going to grant export RINs, which is another idea they were looking at. Of course, we are disappointed in how this went down since it looks like political pressure resulted in short circuiting the policy review process. Now, that's just not good government. It's one thing to have a full balanced review of a proposal and decide it's not the right thing for the country, and it's another to be bullied and abandoning the analysis midstream, which is what it looks to us what happened this time.\nStill the White House, the EPA and Congress have all acknowledged that high RIN prices are a problem for the refiners. This is not the way the program is supposed to work. So, they're going to continue to get pressure until we get the situation addressed. We're going to continue to pursue our legal, regulatory, and legislative options, as are others, and we're going to keep up the fight."]], ["Other big issue, if you look out there is a pretty big difference in some of the light crude pricing, particularly thinking WTI, Midland or Cushing, relative to Gulf Coast prices.

So, we're now about 1.6 million barrels a day of light sweet crude processing capability, with the addition of the toppers in Corpus and Houston. In the Mid-Continent itself, we have 300,000 barrels of refining capacity between Ardmore and McKee, and the Diamond Pipeline, which will start up in December. Then puts Memphis with competitive access to that Midland Cushing market as well, which gives us about 500,000 barrels a day of equivalent Mid-Continent refining capacity. In addition that, we've worked very hard to secure logistics to give us competitive access to Midland and Corpus, and also competitive access to Midland and Cushing at our Houston refineries. And we've also added Line 9, which gives us exposure to that Brent TIR.\nSo, a lot of this work that we've done on logistics over the past several years, we feel like puts us in great position to be able to take advantage of that light sweet, sweet differential."]], ["Valero has been a strong steward of capital over the last few years, and it just seems like the market is really starting to recognize your tight belt on spending and strong capital return. ", ["Yeah, I mean, Spiro, that's a good question. I think you understand the way we look at the use of capital. And we do have a strong cash position. We do have a strong balance sheet. Acquisitions are very opportunistic, as you well know. And we look at everything. To have an effective acquisition for Valero, it's got to be one that there's synergy involved in. And so, that's one of the primary considerations. We have a great portfolio of assets today. So, we're not compelled to do something just because of where we find ourselves. And then we always evaluate the returns that we could achieve with an acquisition or a growth project with that of buying back our shares. And, frankly, we still feel that we're undervalued at the price we're at today. So that competition for the use of what we would deem to be the discretionary cash flow, remains.\nSo, I think you'll see us continue to look at opportunities as they present themselves. I think that you can expect that capital projects will continue to percolate up, and if the returns are there for those projects, we're going to do them. But I mean, nominally, our capital budget is going to be in this, $2.7 billion to $3 billion range. That's just what we feel that we can execute effectively. And if, for some reason, we find some very interesting projects that would increase that number going forward, we've told you guys that we'll make our case with you on why it's a good idea. Anyway, I think what you should expect is a bit more of the same going forward."]], ["I think you've got refined products supply lower than it's been in a while, and as you head into winter time here, I don't think we've seen distillate this low in years. ", ["Well, I think even pre-hurricane, you saw typically during that time period, you see some pretty good builds in distillate and distillate inventories were flat or even falling even before you had the hurricane effect. So, then when you had the supply disruption, it's definitely put us in a very good position in terms of inventory heading into the winter, the heating oil season, with much cold weather at all, I think we're in for a very strong distillate season. And then I think the point you made is accurate, the last several years, distillate hasn't been strong enough to really force refineries into the max distillate mode, and it's kind of created a gasoline build heading into driving season. But this year, it looks like with the strength in distillate, refineries will operate in a max diesel mode, which will help avoid the gasoline build and should be supportive of the gasoline crack next year."]], ["I'm thinking exports, retail, other things you can do, if this is going to drag on a bit more, because it looks like the RIN guidance, the cost guidance has ticked up a little bit from what you had previously.

You look at the pipeline that will take products into the market area, we're going to own a terminal, it'll allow us to blend. We're aggressively expanding our wholesale marketing business. And then the terminal at Houston that we've announced with Magellan is going to allow us to export more product.\nWe don't have our heads in the sand on this, by any stretch of the imagination, and we will continue to develop projects which allow us to deal with this issue. Again, though, Doug that being said, I think this fight is far from over. There's a clear realization, as Jason stated, not only at the White House and in Congress, but also with the regulators, that the RFS as it is structured today is broken. And it's not achieving the objectives of the legislation when it was implemented. And so there will be changes, and we'll continue to deal with it strategically, with the things we can control, and we'll continue to deal with it legislatively and from a regulatory front, to try to come up with some type of a reasonable solution to this.

What I will say is that we deferred our McKee turnaround in the Mid-Continent for about two weeks to help get in the better contractor situation and supply situation, and so that was really just a two-week delay. We did move out a catalyst change in our LCO hydrocracker at Houston into next year. And that's pretty much the extent of our deferrals. We didn't have a lot of turnaround activity in the Gulf Coast going on or the Mid-Continent for that matter going on in the fourth quarter of this year."]], ["The last month or so, we have heard the number of countries in Europe, such as in UK and France, talking about, by 2040, they would stop the sale or ban the sale of the gasoline and diesel car.

One thing that happened recently were the proposed RBOs were released by the EPA, and they were generally what we were expecting. We're pleased to see the reductions in the cellulosic and advanced targets, which seem to be more in line with the volumes that are actually being produced. Regarding the RIN prices, the RBO really didn't change our outlook for what we foresee on the horizon.\nOn the volume side, we still have a 15 billion gallon conventional ethanol target, which has the industry butting up against the blend wall. And the blend wall is a real challenge in light of vehicle warranty, equipment compatibility and other issues. One positive note was, EPA did mention in the proposed RBO that they would be looking at possibly using their reset in the future, which is encouraging. That's a tool they have at their disposal. We also still have this broken structure with a disconnect between the point of obligation and the point of compliance. There're still very long parties and very short parties, and we think this is contributing to the high RIN prices, which are costing consumers billions of dollars a year.\nWe are still hopeful the EPA is going to address the point of obligation. Our petition is still outstanding and the docket is still open. And these high RIN prices really aren't benefiting corn farmers or ethanol producers. It's just the RIN-long parties. They're not leading to more ethanol blending because the parties who control the blending are benefiting from the high RIN prices. So they just have no incentive to push to the blend wall. So, we're hoping this is a situation we can get addressed.\nJoseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.\nWe have been continuing to work this very actively, and really the administration has been very receptive to conversations around this. They are trying to do what's right and to fix broken processes. And so, we remain hopeful that point of obligation is dealt with properly, and we also are hopeful that the EPA uses its authority to adjust the RBOs to be sure that the blend wall doesn't become a chronic problem going forward."]], ["This is kind of maybe not a follow-up, but maybe should have been a prequel to the previous question, Joe, which is about where you think we are in the cycle.

In the second quarter, we were a little below 1.4 million barrels a day, so about 88% of our capacity was utilized in the second quarter. The third quarter, we'll see that trend up a little bit more. Some of it has been, some of the domestic medium sours have still been economic to run, and that's why we're not completely at 100% of our capacity in the system.\nOn the discussions on margins, we tend to look at a mid-cycle case. And our view is that where current margins are, they're below mid-cycle. The gasoline cracks are good, slightly above mid-cycle. But the diesel cracks have been fairly significantly below our mid-cycle case. As we move forward, our view is that the diesel cracks continue to improve, as global demand growth causes those balances to tighten. And then, certainly, when you look out further, the IMO bunker spec change, in our mind, has a significant impact on diesel consumption and will cause cracks to be fairly strong as you approach 2020."]], ["And, Joe, if I could \u2013 again, speaking of people saying we seem to ask this every quarter, but if I could just roll back, you seem to be talking about cash in and cash out is how you're looking at the company.

", ["All right, I'll answer the first part, and then Lane answers the operating cost portion. Really what we saw is, when the OPEC cuts were announced, you really didn't see much of a market response to that announcement. So, the medium sour differentials and the heavy sour differentials remained wide enough that that was the economic barrel to put in front of our system. Had the cuts have gone on longer, longer, the medium sour differentials have come in and the heavy sour differentials have come in such that the most economic barrel to put in front of our refineries is the domestic light sweet. And so, that's what we've done. And the change there kind of started occurring in the second quarter. And even in the second quarter, you saw the domestic medium sour still economic. But now, if you look at the MARS versus MEH type spread, or TI in Houston; it strongly favors running domestic light sweet. And so that's where we're headed, and I think we'll be there until the OPEC production comes back.\nR. Lane Riggs - Valero Energy Corp.\nWell, Doug, this is Lane. In terms of the incremental operating cost or light versus medium or heavy, I think at a reportable level, it's not very measurable. I mean, I don't think you would see a change in our operating costs, based on our crude mix.\nWhere it would show up, if we run more or less barrels. And so, to the extent that, at some of our refineries when we go light, like at Port Arthur, we actually run more barrel, because our coker fills up later. So, on an OpEx basis, you might actually see our OpEx go down. But, it's a little bit by refinery by refinery whether it would show up. I sort of believe you wouldn't see it in aggregate. We wouldn't \u2013 it wouldn't be a reconciling item for us."]], ["Your project queue, as it relates to somewhat limited growth capital with your discipline and so on, I'm just wondering where the whole export strategy fits for products in Valero's strategy going forward.

We've talked in the past about a petrochemical strategy, and it's it really not as dramatic or as significant as you might be thinking. Currently, we produce a number of petrochemical streams. Products like propylene and BTX. And the strategy that we're talking about here is really to capture more of the margin available from those petrochemical stream where it makes economic sense to do so. The investments associated would be related to any additional processing, and then logistics to store and transport these products. We have no plans to deviate from our capital allocation framework, and decisions to allocate capital to these projects will be based on the expected project returns within our notional capital budget.\nSo, although these guys are investing in these major petchem projects, that's really not our plan or our focus. And we do continue to have a focus on improving our refinery operations. We have a focus on integrating from the wellhead into the refineries, and from the refineries out, so that the margin that's captured in the movement of products and crude is something that we capture rather than paying to somebody else. And so, I don't think that you should worry that you're going to wake up one day and we're going to be announcing that we're investing in a mega billion dollar petchem complex.

And so, half of that capital is deemed to be refining projects, which have the higher 25% return threshold. Could be 24%, could be 28%. But they're typically in that range or better. And, on the logistics side, we know that those tend to be lower-risk projects, and so they tend to have lower return thresholds. And so that's where we use kind of a 12% to 15% threshold for. And that capital is split 50/50 between those two categories.

The big change really, on the medium sours we've shifted a little bit. We've seen more of an impact from both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on the medium sour barrels we import from there, and we backfill those with some additional South American grades and Canadian grades. And then recently, over the last few weeks, we have actually started at one of our refineries to maximize some light sweet and replace some of the medium sour we're importing there.\nJoseph W. Gorder - Valero Energy Corp.\nSo, Paul, on the strategy and I mentioned it earlier. I think the things that we're doing today and they're very much focused on making us the best refining and marketing operation out there, and I believe that, based on the independent surveys that we really are the best, but we continue to raise the bar for ourselves and try to drive it forward. Again, that's not a short-term activity. That is a long-term activity that we'll continue to do going forward. Now, if you think long-term about the markets, okay, and the demand for our products more specifically, you say, well is U.S. demand going to continue to grow going forward? I think our forecast would be that in the next five to ten years you might see a slight decline in gasoline demand in the U.S. Diesel will be determined by economic activity, and so we'll just see how that goes. But as Gary mentioned earlier, we are seeing decent diesel demand, and a lot of that is being driven by the increase in activity that we've got in the E&P side of the business.\nIf you think longer term and you think about where demand is going to grow, everything we read is that, globally, you're going to have increased demand for all of our products. And so our focus will go beyond the U.S. borders and we'll take a look at opportunities to increase our market presence in different international markets, and one of the things that Rich and his team are focused on are establishing a footprint in some of those markets so that we have better access to them on a rateable basis.\nSo, I don't think you should expect us to shift the strategy materially going forward. Clearly, midstream growth is something we're focused on. Continuing to improve our refining and our renewables operation is something we're focused on. And then we've talked in the past about the possibility to take some of the streams that we're producing today and high grade them by legging into the petrochemical business. That's something that's probably a little bit longer term, but it is something that we're actively looking at these days and trying to figure out what is a way for us to enter that type of business, boiling the frog rather than diving in head first and see if we can create another earnings stream for the company."]], ["I know that includes some tier compliance and I guess I'm just wondering, as you kind of get through that this year, is there an opportunity for that to move lower into the future?

Somewhere around $200 million to $300 million is what we think normally is sort of regulatory spend that is not \u2013 we sort of put into the sustaining capital but it's not like we're \u2013 we're not rebuilding our assets or maintaining them, it's something that we're having to do due to regulatory things.

Second, I'd say overall, our portfolio is very well positioned for a value based market. So I think we've got the best portfolio, room for expensive niche products is not exactly the best position. We saw some Ethos volume and that's global, that's not U.S. impact, I want to make that point. We saw the good U.S. volume despite not having Ethos yet to sell, we don't have 510(k) approval should see it towards the late end of this year, maybe early in January and that's good. So funnel remains strong, product portfolio is great and I think the portfolio is very well lined up for the market and maybe the last thing I would add is you heard that really outstanding results of our software business both in the quarter and the year. That is very much at this point developed market growth. We are starting to see, you heard me mention the nice order in China, it\u2019s the biggest software order we've ever received in China. So we've localized that product. Yes, I mean speaking Chinese is one thing but getting the right workflow and the right interfaces and responding to the customer needs in China is a big deal as well and I really like what the team has done there. So think that product is positioned for continued growth both in developed and developing markets."]], ["So as you look at fiscal 2020, how much of the guidance reflects; one, the tariff reversal both on the top and bottom-line; and then how much is from the interventional oncology rollout? ", ["It's a good question. Anthony we will walk you through it in detail. Let me kind of start with and I'll turn over to Gary for the details. We're actually very pleased with the orders growth so the P&L starts there and the orders have been terrific as you know and I'd say they're broad based. So we're especially seeing them in accretive parts of portfolio Halcyon, software, services et cetera. The organic part of the business is booming. So when you look at the year-over-year from an operating earning points of view, if we start fiscal year '19 at $542 million, we think there's almost $100 million of year-over-year organic investment. And kind of with that as a introduction, let me turn it over to Gary to give you a complete walk on the earnings guidance.\nGary Bischoping\nYes, what I would say just to clarify that point, from a year-over-year basis there is over $100 million of organic operating margin accretion, right?\nDow Wilson\nTariffs, 100 million reported.\nGary Bischoping\nTariffs ex-acquisitions, right. And so to Dow's point that's revenue growth and inside of that revenue growth what you're seeing on the margin line is, you\u2019re seeing that software growth now growing faster than the hardware right and that's pulling through more margin dollars. You're seeing the installed base growth now pulling through the services part of the P&L whish is also at a higher margin. As we referenced on the call we've got Halcyon now banging through the P&L, 116 of them installed out there in the field. You're now starting to see the accretion from that in the margin. So that strong growth coupled with margin expansion out of the core business in addition to the fact that on the VPS side, on the proton side, we are now seeing the services business grow as we get more rooms installed in clinic and get to that one year period. So you\u2019re seeing the portfolio unveil itself in the core and really now you can see you with the tariffs kind of out of the noise you can see the operating performance of the company. And with that we also have the tariffs impact as you mentioned. So all of that stacks up to what we think is the right place to guide and deliver in the P&L. All -- we're doing all that Anthony delivering that guidance while making significant investments in ongoing innovation to maintain the growth in the company over the medium to long-term. Building out the acquisitions, further investments in China to grow, right, our ability to drive more out of the R&D portfolio that Chris is running and operating. So to summarize we think this is pragmatic guidance, the growth is being driven by the core as well as the acquisitions that are off to a good start, and we have a significant investment on the acquisition side as well."]], ["And then just Dow, you mentioned China order flow for next year that I guess I can think your comment was even the back -- the last quarter you could see some contribution but as we look in the fiscal '20 what is the expectation for order flow in China specifically off of the Class A and B licenses. ", ["Yes, on the reimbursements side, I'd say, we don't really have anything to update you on. I think we're pretty thorough. There is some posted comments on our investor website on kind of where we see things. So, I don't know if there is much of an update. Obviously, we were very pleased with the performance of the business and the portfolio and especially in the U.S. this quarter, it shows you the strength of the hardware and software businesses together. New acquisitions are also hitting in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets as well. I'd say China, we don't guide to China orders number. We do have tougher comps in that market because we have had very strong double-digit growth over 2019. I think we'll remain very strong there. So, funnel looks good. We are excited about Halcyon 2.0. So, we have got some good Halcyon 1.0 momentum in China and we should get that regulatory approval coming soon. And then of course we will have Ethos launch mid-year, next year, may be late in the year, but the -- depending on how fast we can get that through. But we -- it remains our second largest market, very important market to us. We continue to invest in the team, have an outstanding team in China that's really executing and we like what we see."]], ["Would you say there's any change in the environment in the Americas or in APAC, you called out some weakness in the number of geographies or would you chalk this up to some variability? ", ["Looking at the biggest picture, first of all, trailing 12 months growth remains robust across all geographies. Our orders are lumpy, as you know, it's also tough to grow off a very large comp. We had a very, very good third quarter last year. And, but now just kind of making around the horn on the geographies, the trailing 12 months in the Americas is 6%. We're very pleased with long term performance. The -- we had strong wins at the Veterans Hospital. I'd say, certainly here in the short term, there's no indication that CMS proposal is impacting US demand, wouldn't make that linkage at all.\nThe US product portfolio remains in a very good position to drive growth. We're seeing software, competitive takeouts, installed base growth, and a lot of folks transitioning to higher technology with SBRT capability. Asia, as I said in the script, we continue to see strong double digit growth in China, despite the fact that we\u2019re not seeing [ph] any traction yet from the licensed quota, but China remains very, very strong, rest of Asia and Japan did not grow in the quarter. These are smaller markets with lumpier businesses, but all are growing double digit on a trailing 12 month basis and it's certainly been strong for us for the last year.\nAs I said about EMEA, this is the eighth consecutive double digit constant currency growth quarter we've had, so we're continuing to see a strong environment there. I mentioned on the call, we did see the first activity in the Tata agreement. We booked two orders in the quarter. Now, we hope that will continue to grow. I think that's probably a pretty good around the horn.\nGary, anything to add there, am I missing anything.\nGary Bischoping\nNo. The software growth continues to perform well from an orders perspective as well as we continue to sell those solutions around the globe. That's the only thing I would add, Dow.\nDow Wilson\nYeah. And maybe, since I messed up the number, we did get three proton orders in the quarter. And I'd also say the funnel looks pretty good there so far after a couple of quarters with no proton activity. It's nice to see that come back."]], ["So, I\u2019ll just stick with this topic for my last question, and just thinking about this obviously just past this next quarter, I think people will understand dilution from deals, but as I think about the year and you guys having started out at 17% to 18% operating earnings, talking about getting to north of 20 and here we are, looking to end the year at 16.5, inevitably, the question is going to come and go. ", ["I think a couple of things there, I mean, great question. So, first of all, there's roughly 160 basis point impact from tariffs in that number. Okay, and so, let's add that to the top, and then that starts to get you, heading in the right direction relative to the 20%. The 20% that we gave, certainly wasn't inclusive of what's going on with the tariff environment we're in today. So that's kind of point one.\nTwo is, yes, we are seeing some nice tailwinds from hardware accretion from Halcyon. We've now got 90 of those installed in the world and good healthy backlog to pull from. So, we're seeing that nice accretion. I would say that, we are seeing dilution on the other side of that from the acquisitions, investments in Flash and other investments that we've alluded to along the way. And, I would say that software is going to continue to be a good tailwind for us. We saw it here in the third quarter, we anticipate seeing it for the rest of the year and continue to be a nice mix up from a margin rate perspective. Proton profitability has improved the last two years on a year-over-year basis and with Kolleen at the helm and the work she has underway, we hope to continue that down the path. So -- and then we'll get some operating leverage out of this portfolio, as we stabilize those investments to support the growth in the near term. So, we feel good about where we're exiting the year from an operating earnings perspective. And to remind you that even with the tariffs, we're still going to grow operating earnings dollars on a year-over-year basis."]], ["Just as we look ahead and when we start to see orders from say Tata and then also the outstanding tenders that are in China, that 1400 or so systems, I mean, how are you expecting eventually that to roll through? ", ["Let me talk India first. We\u2019re very pleased with the Tata relationship, a big piece of our EMEA growth this last year has been India. And that continues, even, it's kind of same story in both India and China, right. I mean, the core business is doing very, very well. If you look at it on a revenue basis, our five year CAGR in India is 20%. So that's kind of the India story. Our radiation therapy utilization in India is less than 20%. So there's still a huge access issue. That's what the Tata foundation really wants to get at. We booked the first two orders. It's underway, two LINACs and two brachytherapy orders, so those are kind of their pilots to get it going.\nI think there's been a lot of focus on the election and the campaign and now, the government is rolling out budgets, I think we will see, over the next few years, more engagement from the government buyers in India. So, you have kind of our core market, the Tata Foundation, and the India government getting into it. So, I mean, it's going to be a little bit lumpy and we don't guide to orders, but that's kind of the market that we're seeing in India. On China, we're seeing the historical market, as I mentioned a minute ago, is very strong and continues to be strong.\nI would maybe add one thing to it. And that is we're starting to see a private market emerge in China. And, that's good. The Ministry of Health thing as I mentioned, it's on our expectations. We had hoped to see some here in the second half of the year. I think, that's what we said earlier in the year. We do see provinces starting to kind of get their ducks in a row and line up, now what economy emerges in China and is there some fiscal restraint and how does that impact us, I couldn't look in the eye and tell you how that's going to impact us one way or the other at this point. But, maybe there would be some of that. But frankly, the core business continues to rock in China and we feel very comfortable about its growth and about our market position there, I mean, literally, that our market share has been trending up there the last eight, nine quarters and continues to be very strong position as a leader, so grateful for that."]], ["That was not a -- it didn't look like a great number to us and I don't know if services is a part of that, that looks like it wasn't growing nearly as fast as it had been in the past but software looked like it was growing quite fast and that's usually a good guide contributor. ", ["Yes. Great, Amit. And thanks for the question. And the gross margin rate, as it relates to the second quarter, there is that Proton kind of site delay as well the project costs. That cost is about -- thinking about that is kind of 80 basis points in the quarter. And then we'll continue to invest in other elements of the business. But overall, that was a big part of what we saw in the second quarter was that proton -- that proton piece and then gross margin rate.\nFrom the services perspective, trailing 12-month growth rate is just fine there. We had a tough compare. Last year, we had a 14% year-on-year growth rate in Q2 in the services side from a revenue perspective. The business is healthy, attach rates are fine, underlying to the -- elements of that are moving along just fine. So we're okay on the services line.\nAnd we had strong growth in orders over the last 12 months. And so we just have to wait, also, for those to anniversary from one key perspective and to start to see the growth rate off of those what that orders trajectories are over the last 12 months.\nAs far as going forward goes, I mean from a gross margin rate perspective, as you know we don't guide to that, however, some of what we talked about all throughout the year will start to roll through. One would certainly be our commercial efforts on the tariff mitigation side. That will start to pick up steam in the second half. As you think about that in the second half, it's still more loaded to the second part, so the fourth quarter of the second half. We'll continue -- as you saw, we invested in software deployment teams. So we'll continue to see, we think, nice, strong growth out of the software business, which will be accretive to the gross margin rate in the second half vis-a-vis the first half. And again just to tie it up, that proton issue that we saw or the challenges we saw with the site delays as well as the overall increase in cost, that we think we are continuing to the second quarter. And so that will be accretive in the second half as well. So good underlying dynamics that help us get comfortable with holding on to that range from an earnings per share perspective all while still investing back in the business.\nDow Wilson\nMaybe just to underscore the software point. Our software growth rate is about twice our hardware growth rate and our hardware growth rate is very good. So that's kind of what that investment is laying in for us in the second half. And we should see some -- both some volume and some positive margin mix out of that."]], ["I mean it just seems like a lot of things could be coming together, with China availability starting January, 2.0 having been available for 6 or 12 months here in the U.S. ", ["I would say we love the orders momentum, the socket growth is starting out nicely. Our marketing efforts are working well. Customer endorsements have been outstanding. We have really strong engagement, excellent experience with our customers. I think I said in the call 70% of the Halcyon units, we believe, are incremental. So we're -- so it is hitting. We did launch the product in the beginning of the quarter in China. And we just have a handful of orders in the quarter from China. So we expect -- as you state, we expect that to start hitting, so there should be some good growth coming in China. We have had very good customer reaction in China. Our strategy here is we just want to expand the number of sockets out there. And it really complements our TrueBeam product in the portfolio. We're seeing incremental customers come in with small vaults, resource constraint on the operating side, winning some competitive take-outs and I think we're going to have some cobalt replacements on top of that. I think we're very well positioned for continued growth with Halcyon."]], ["And is it reasonable to think that this will track as typical with Varian and talk about maybe a 12-month lag and we'll start seeing some of that order growth convert to revenue beginning fiscal '20? ", ["Yes. No, great question. And what we're seeing here is from an overall trailing 12-month growth rate in Oncology of 13%. And when you take a look at backlog, backlog grew about the same on a year-over-year basis. So we continue to move product through that, through backlog, and out into revenue at a nice clip. The conversion rate will reflect some of the nuances in the underlying mix of the product in the business. But overall, Jason, when you think about this in the long term, we still see our revenue -- our orders turn into revenue growth and convert. So the trajectory of the orders growth rate continues to accelerate. So you're going to see the revenue growth rate kind of lag a little bit here, and that's what's happening in the business. But overall, we're pleased with how the teams are operating and pushing product out the door and meeting, exceeding customers' needs and demands."]], ["As far as China, as we look toward really, I guess, quoting now 2020, when you start to see order momentum, clearly there's a larger amount of Type B licenses out there. ", ["I think it's going to be small, growing linearly. I mean the one thing about this market is it's one or two at a time. We tend not to see the big like the Tata thing or the Brazil thing we had a few years ago or even Algeria or some of the other companies that we've talked about last 2 or 3 years where we get, call it, 10 to 50 units as part of an order. China is much more linear in the way it's tendered kind of hospital at a time. So I think that's the way it's going to happen. I don't think that's the way that market is as well. There are big resource needs. By the way, I think it's one of the things that we're very uniquely positioned to do well. A lot of these are going to be going into smaller cities, more rural orientation, county hospitals. They don't need just the license, they need the people, the training, the education. We have localized the software now. We have significant education resources both on the ground and in flight, so we train everybody locally. We think we're in a very, very good position.\nGary Bischoping\nThe only thing I would add there, Anthony, is that we've got Halcyon and TrueBeam both in that category now and didn't have that over the last 12 to 24 months as we considered that marketplace. So we've got, as Dow just -- Dow mentioned, just to put a finer point on it, well positioned to go out there and execute in these rural markets with Halcyon and TrueBeam."]], ["Maybe on that last point, Dow, one of the things that you guys have talked about was bundling, if you could maybe kind of catalyze some of those customers that don't have SBRT capabilities to upgrade. ", ["I'd say at least 1,000 units. That's kind of my gut reaction. I might need to get our pencil on that a little finer. But I mean our U.S. installed base is 3,500 machines, and we've got a lot of TrueBeam out there. But there's SBRT capabilities on TrueBeam as well as -- I mean it's at least 1,000 units that we have significant opportunity on. But I think it's some of the momentum we're seeing in the U.S. now. I mean you saw the numbers on the quarter, double-digit performance in North America, and I think we're seeing a lot of nice configuration mix out of the U.S. market."]], ["It's on the top line and the reiteration, I mean obviously if we think about the order growth in the first quarter being where it was pretty high, and looking at your backlog in health and high single-digit growth there, you know kind of begs the question of why your top line guidance couldn't have been raised a little bit. ", ["Yes, sure. Thanks, Amit. I think the way to think about in terms of headwinds and tailwinds as we thought through that question is there are still some unknowns in the macro environment, and I wouldn't say the geopolitical environment is cleared up any at all either. And so, we're keeping a close eye on that and want to make sure we continue to be aware of that risk as we thought about the guidance.\nThe other thing is that no orders here in Q1 in the proton business. And so, I would say that would be a headwind as we think about the full-year guidance. That being said, our oncology business is just a fantastic continuation of the momentum of the business. China and India continue to be strong; our European business now six quarters in a row of growth, and so, I think we kind of balance it too, you know, strength in the oncology portfolio is offset by some risk in the top line. Our VPS business, our proton business and cumulative guidance of five to 18 will hold there."]], ["And then I want to come back to China, just given this is your first earnings call since that announcement, and I'm curious if you can, you've had a couple more months now since then to kind of get smarter on this, and out of the 1,400 or so, if we think about the 12 units in that tender, you know, what percent do you think are going to ultimately get consummated that's the question I often did get just given the context with the prior tender? ", ["I mean the short answer is it kind of depends. In our experience, all of them eventually get relieved. I think in the kind of timeframe that they have announced, the reality is it's probably going to be 70% to 80%, but I think it's fair to assume that eventually all 100% of - at least that's been their track record when they - when there is a license, it's going to happen. And I think that's kind of what we're seeing early on as I said in my remarks, you know, we haven't seen a material impact so far, and yet we had a very strong quarter in China, very strong double-digit quarter in China, and that is also from an order booking point of view we book them after the license are awarded to the sites and they issue a tender, so it's going to go all the way through the process for us to book an order."]], ["Just one other, one other follow-up on here and just on the Proton service revenue in this and/or the segment profitability, Gary, I think you referenced to make a delay in Proton segment breakeven, they've been no longer falling into this year. ", ["Let me just comment on that, order piece of that and Gary can take the rest of it. In 2017, we had seven orders, in 2018, two orders. And for us to achieve our breakeven targets, we need some orders. So that's where we are clearly net order in the quarter. And as we think the number of orders that we take this year is probably somewhere between 2017 and 2018 actually somewhere between the two and the seven. We feel pretty good about that that as well as probably second half loaded. And so business is little bit lumpy and that's going to affect a little bit the timing of our kind of breakeven target. And with that, Gary, you can comment on the rest of the P&L.\nGary Bischoping\nYes. I would say the teams are executing across the rest of the P&L very well from where we're spending R&D dollars to controlling expense, to the pursuits that are required to pull deals out of the pipe which by the way we think is strong and probably second half weighted, but still strong. So we'll kind of see how this plays out I'm not going to guide you beyond what we talked about already. And like we said the teams that are out there executing and we still believe in that business and we'll continue to put investment in Flash and go down that path as an option on the back of getting the rest of the service rooms up and running and realizing the profitability from that. So, we'll continue to make this play and continue to invest in the business accordingly as we go through time."]], ["Got you, and then maybe a couple of quick follow-ups; one, Dow, on interesting comment in the slide deck, right, the cash from operations down, but the drivers were really inventories sub and that seems to be signaling you guys are prepping to fulfill some orders in the back half year. ", ["I mean, you see our revenue guidance, revenue guidance was 5% to 8% we've reaffirmed that today. When you look at that revenue guidance and think about the tariff and FX hit, it's really about 150 basis points higher than that. So you're really talking about something that's more in the call it six to 10 range rather than five to eight range by the time you kind of take the revenue impact of the currency headwind and the tariff headwinds. So the revenue number is pretty big. We are building some inventory, we want to make sure we deliver on the revenue guidance and if we have a little extra inventory to take care of some upside. So be it. We see momentum continuing into 2020. So we want to build ahead here and that's what we're doing."]], ["I thought maybe I would start with Halcyon just because it was obviously such a big change just from 90 days ago and from what we've seen really since the launch. ", ["Thanks. A couple of things. First of all, we love the volume. I think that's something that we've been seeing in our funnel all along, ever since we introduced it, that the kilovoltage clearance, the 510(k), clearly had an impact in the U.S. market as well as the kilovoltage introduction at ASTRO earlier this year to go out and get that funnel going. Well, you heard the numbers. We had very good uptake in Europe on that product. As well for the kilovoltage product, along with some of the adaptive radiation therapy vision that we're talking about on the product, is really triggering the developed market. But I'd say, the other thing that we really like about this is one thing that's been consistent from the launch is 40% of these are incremental new sockets. So we really -- we really like that fact. We are very strong in emerging markets, 60% mature, 40% emerging markets on the year. So that's good, 40% new sites. So it's growing our installed base. And I think that's a really -- kind of to underscore that, 40% of the Halcyon orders we took in 2018 were for greenfield sites. These are folks new in the business. We're very excited about that. We also saw a fair amount of competitive takeouts, and I mean, we've been talking a little bit. We've had the question on the tender market.

Halcyon is very complementary-focused to our product line. We want to keep both growing. We love the quarter. As I said, we had huge uptake in incremental sockets going in the installed base. That's really been the focus. So having both of these products in our product basket is just a market-leading position. It can't be beat. In terms of kind of where does it go, we're very interested to watch what happens in developed markets. The product has had a very good reception in developed markets. And the kilovoltage introduction is new here at ASTRO. Sorry, if my voice was a little gravelly. I have been talking a lot in the last 5 days. But the adaptive strategy with Halcyon is going to give us some more legs in the developed market. And then in emerging markets, I mean, even with this big uptick that we saw in Q4, we still had 40% of the actual percentage that was growing in emerging markets, is exactly what we've seen over the rest of the year. So I think -- and a very good position. I just -- kind of stepping back a little bit from -- today, is the last day of the ASTRO exhibit here. We've got the strongest debt portfolio we've ever had. When you kind of look across hardware, software, proton therapy, vision for the future, capture the imagination of our customers, I don't -- I couldn't be prouder of the team and what the -- what we've done at this year's ASTRO."]], ["And then the follow-up on guidance would be, I guess, by my math, that's about a $0.16 impact to earnings from tariffs, but I know there's a variable there in share count.

And Anthony, you're pretty much spot on. $0.15, $0.16 is spot on to the impact. So good math there.\nDow Wilson\nYes. And then in terms of what's the likelihood of getting an exemption, we continue to have encouraging and productive conversations with key government leaders to ensure that we can bring our cancer solutions to patients around the world and especially in China. We're actively -- we filed an exemption to exclude this from the current trade dispute. We won't know until that's -- it's kind of a binary thing, yes, or no. In the meantime, we're monitoring the situation very, very closely."]], ["Obviously, what you guys kind of elected, to talk about a pickup in market growth over the last couple of quarters, can you just talk about what you think is driving that pickup in your view?

In EMEA, we were up 17%, 13% in constant currency. And then APAC, we were up 9% on the year, up 8% in constant currency. So when you kind of think about that in the context of the markets, I'd say the exceptional one here has been EMEA. And EMEA has been across the board. Some of it is emerging markets. So we've got Africa and India and Eastern Europe in those numbers, Russia in those numbers, Middle East. I think that's going to continue. We've had very good performance in Western Europe as well, Central and Western Europe. So that's been good. I'd say, we think that market's hanging in there. It's probably not a double-digit market, but it's hanging in there, and the rest continues to grow very, very well. The other growth numbers in Asia and Americas -- Americas is -- maybe a little better than we've done historically.\nAsia, arguably, we've done better. So when I kind of look at the balance, I think the markets are going to be up a little bit from what we've kind of historically talked about. We've kind of historically talked about a 2 to 4 number, and it's probably more a mid-single-digit kind of market scenario, with some upside. And we'll say this, we feel very good about our portfolio, and one of the things that we're seeing is we think the portfolio might -- the upside in the market scenario might be upgrades and finally getting people to close out, to change out, 12- to 15-year-old products to upgrade.

From a capital allocation perspective, I would say that you saw us a little more active in the market here in the fourth quarter, buying back about $50 million worth of stock versus we were averaging the $25 million to $30 million or so prior to that. We'll continue to manage to roughly a flat share count as we have included this assumption inside of that earnings per share guidance. And we'll kind of see how this plays out and go from there.

So, we don't see the service impact for one year.\nBut, yes, the product revenue was higher than the service revenue this quarter. But both were double-digit, we'll take it, so that's kind of where we are. In time, that service revenue number will catch up as we come out of warranty.

So as it relates to oncology, we really saw good progress out of Europe with the order to revenue cycle. We've seen some good quality orders there. We've seen an acceleration of revenue in the period from prior six months orders versus the prior year.

We'll communicate it then. Dow, anything else to add?\nDow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.\nMaybe just the regulatory steps have been completed. So we like that. It's progressing.

And orders in Europe were really high quality and turned very fast here that we took in the last six months versus the ability for us to turn those orders in the prior year. And that's good like I said operational execution, quality order and sales process and we turn that over pretty quick. I wouldn't read a trend into that one way or another because things are lumpy in any given quarter.

Relative to Oncology 360, it's really the kind of vision story. It describes how and where we're going. It's resonating very well with customers. We're still installing those and getting the evidence to kind of drive the enterprise sale.\nAs I mentioned on the call, we did receive Best in KLAS, kind of the third-party Gartner of our industry, for both Eclipse and ARIA. So we've got a very good competitive position. We continue to invest strongly in those markets. We did announce acquisition. It's a pretty small acquisition of Evinance, but the capability there is very important. It has clinical decision support tools that keep people on track for guidelines.

So there is very good interest there. So we think longer term that the funnel looks very good, but we had a very good quarter in Japan, it was up significantly year-over-year. Southeast Asia was also up year-over-year, we had very good performance on a number of geographies in Southeast Asia. Australia was really the only one that was kind of go the other way.

There \u2013 the from a product point of view it was all about our Edge product had very good up-tick of Edge, Gary mentioned in his remarks as well as on VitalBeam. The other thing that we are starting to see in Asia and especially in China is some very good up-tick in the software side of the business.

It\u2019s the orders are incremental, they are in new sockets, it\u2019s growing our installed base, we did surprise the market with this product, our funnel remains very, very strong. I think what we are excited about is we have tiered the product and so we really think that we can get both more aggressive, but kind of lower end price points and with the coming of kilovoltage Cone-beam CT, higher price points in developed markets. So we are very excited about where this product goes. We are seeing some activity in the tender market. Those customers try to \u2013 trying to put themselves in line and develop budgets for the product. So I think it\u2019s very much in the budget development part of the market.

Look, we continue to monitor that MPTC is showing pretty good results relative to the patient volume. They continued to work their way through driving those with multiple initiatives, maybe Dow can help chime in there here in the second, but that\u2019s a key to success. And we have seen very good markets with regard to the municipal bond market, right. The Georgia Proton Center kind of got that started. Delray kind of followed through, we have successful refinancing the CPT Center in San Diego that\u2019s now clinically moved over to a new operator as well. So, we do see strong capital markets for these assets and that combined with kind of steady to slightly rising patient counts should help us move our way through this.\nDow Wilson\nYes, I think just on Maryland, they are doing very well. Their patient count is around 100 patients a day. So, they are getting good volumes. They are doing very interesting work. I think the medical staff is very much on board with the program, have an outstanding team and are continuing to drive it forward."]], ["Go back to guidance, you are guiding to 4% to 7% after doing 13% this quarter, maybe Gary, can you kind of address the question as to whether there was some pull forward this quarter or whether you are just being a little bit conservative on the rest of the year?

And as mature markets are shorter duration to get from orders to revenue that certainly helped that revenue growth, whether that continues or not over the rest of the quarter, probably not at that rate that we saw in Q1. As it relates to what\u2019s organic, what we gave is guidance 4% to 7% is organic growth rate, right and so currency, there is some benefit here that we have seen the short-term. We will see if that holds on. You saw a little bit here in Q1, but really what you are staring out there 4% to 7% is our organic growth guidance."]], ["So Gary or Dow, I guess for you, just looking at the revenue guidance, again with the 2% to 4%, you did have 7% oncology order growth this past year, 11% I think companywide with a strong year in proton. ", ["Why don't I start and then Gary can clean up here a little bit. As we said on the call, we are guiding to 2% to 4%. When you look at 2016 and 2017, we had 1% growth in 2016 and 7% growth in 2017. We have had a good orders year in 2016. That was a good orders year. And you saw the results on the quarter were also positive. With the increased mix in our EMEA backlog and 15 to 18 months cycle time on the backlog we have taken a pretty pragmatic view on our growth guidance. And at the highest level, that's how we are kind of penciling it out.\nGary, anything to add there?\nGary Bischoping\nYes. Look Jeff, we are coming out of a transitional year as well and the spin of Varex, new product launches with Halcyon and HyperArc, our new brand. We are going to continue to watch our conversion metrics as we go through the year. But like Dow said, this is a pragmatic approach to revenue guidance at 2% to 4% for the year."]], ["And maybe I am wondering if there is any chance with Halcyon out there, are any orders kind of sitting in backlog a little bit longer than usual, hospitals reevaluating, do they want to convert from one system to Halcyon instead? ", ["Yes. We are not seeing extension in the backlog timing. We are seeing a little mix. So as we said last quarter, we are seeing a little mix to more vaults outside of our developed markets. And those, as people build new vaults that takes a little bit longer. So we might have a little bit of a geographic mix that way.\nGary Bischoping\nYes. Just to build on that a little bit and I will answer your currency question just thereafter. The market we just came out of for the trailing 12 months through the third quarter, market growth was 2.1%. And so we just guided to 2% to 4%. And then our orders growth over that same period of time is 3.4%. So again we feel like that guiding in 2% to 4% is a pragmatic approach to that number.\nAnd then to answer on the currency side is no. We assume no currency impact next year."]], ["So I am just wondering if you can give us some puts and takes to think about for operating margin and why you are not able to show additional benefits in fiscal 2018? ", ["Sure. So as it relates to the operating earnings margin rates, look, we are looking for targeting and driving sustainable improvement in our supply chain and operating expenses. This range that we gave would infer 50 to maybe 70 or even 100 basis points to the top end of the range of operating margin improvement in FY 2018 over FY 2017, when you take a look at things on a apples-to-apples basis. We are still trying to achieve that 18% to 22% aspirational target that we have got in front of us. And we also want to be cognizant of the fact that we want to ensure the ability to invest in growth options organically that we see in front of us. So that's the nature of the guidance from an 18% to 19% perspective on operating earnings.\nAs it relates to share repurchase, there will be share repurchase just like there was in the fourth quarter, right. We did $25 million to retire 250,000 shares. What I said in my guidance is that share count would be flat year-over-year. So there will be due to restricted shares and stock option exercises, there will be shares that come into the share count and we will endeavor to keep that flat year-over-year with our share repurchase activity in FY 2018. And again, the overall objective here from how we deploy capital is, one organically like I just said, two is look at inorganic options. We feel like we have good financial flexibility relative to our capitalizing on inorganic activities that are in front of us. And then third and only thereafter, we would execute on the share repurchase side."]], ["And so just if I look at where you are coming from prior year, it does imply a bit of a deceleration even though you have a new product cycle in Halcyon. ", ["So just so we are on the same page, we grew 2% in oncology for the full year, right. And we see now and we are guiding now, I am sorry, 1% year-on-year in oncology and so we are guiding now %2 to 4% overall for 2018. So we don't see it as a deceleration in the growth rate. We kind of see it at or better than what we did here in 2017. Again, we will continue to keep a close eye on conversion rates and the opportunities we see in front of us. But we feel that that's pragmatic growth given the orders growth rate we have seen historically over the last 12 to 18 months.\nDow Wilson\nAnd then for emerging market approvals, the biggest two, well one in that emerging market is Japan. We think both Japan and China, we should have approvals end of Q2, our fiscal Q2, end of Q3 next year, beginning of Q3.\nLet's start that over. End of Q2, beginning of Q3 next year we should have China and Japan. Those are the two largest approvals that are remaining."]], ["Maybe just some of the drivers there and your outlook as you look forward for Oncology gross margins and maybe overall gross operating margin goals for the company next several years. ", ["Sure. Thanks, Anthony. We were very happy with the Oncology margin rate and, honestly, the operating execution inside of that business. And given what we saw on the top line, I think we did a good job of managing through and making the right trade-offs associated with where we're investing and how we drove profitability in the quarter. So I think our execution was very good there.\nAs it relates to kind of what happened, the dynamics around it, there's about 0.6% of that 48.1% was driven by an excise tax refund. And so, that certainly was part of that over-delivery. And then the services mix increase was another 100 to 150 basis points of that. And so, you have to kind of carve those two things off.\nWe think we can execute that Oncology gross margin rate in the 44% to 45% range and we think that makes sense relative to being able to then drive our EBIT from 18.5% to, say, 19% to 20% in the near term. So we think good, solid execution in pricing, our ability to get some operating leverage post the Varex spin really make that a realistic number as we think about profitability heading into the fourth quarter.\nDow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.\nYeah. And our long-term goal remains, over the next three years, can we get us back to 22% return on sales. So, that remains our long-term goal."]], ["Just you called out China as an area of growth this quarter, but competitors that we've followed in the space have struggled I think to really gain orders in that market and it's delayed their growth in subsequent quarters. ", ["The market remains very good. I like to think of this at a very high level. And when you look at the percent of patients in China that are treated with radiation, it's less than 20%. In U.S. and Western Europe, it's between 50% and 60%. So, that's where I like to start. There's a huge need.\nAnd then when you start thinking about it in terms of kind of urban China versus rural China, that's a description of urban China and rural China hasn't even been touched yet. So we are optimistic of our position in all segments. We've worked very hard to kind of get a leading market share in both. We've historically been a leader in the private market and we're working very hard to be a leader in the public market. We're now established leadership in both markets. And we feel very good about that position.\nSo, in terms of the market, I'd say the market and long-term trends are very positive. It is a market that every now and then, what, it was two, two-and-a-half years ago, we had this reform hiccup where they went quiet for a quarter or two while they retooled their purchasing processes due to some anti-kickback issues that they had had in other sectors in healthcare, not in radiation therapy. That impacted everybody, of course.\nEvery now and then when political change happens and chairs rotate, we see a little bit of delay. But I'd say, when you kind of look at trailing 12 months, it's been strong double-digit growth and we feel pretty good about that as being the market. Might we have a quarter or two where things slow down, that could always happen, but our funnel remains very robust in China. We got a very good team over there and feel very good about where the team is, getting deeper and broader and I believe worked hard to establish share leadership in that market, and now have it and are looking to leverage it as that market builds out its cancer capability.\nAnd I think, oh by the way, this is worth a reminder.

", ["Yeah Elisha, go ahead.\nElisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.\nYeah. Jeff, so let me take the tax first. So yes, it was lower than we expected in Q1. It ended up being roughly an exact offset to the reduction in the proton gross profit that we were expecting. So we hit the high end of the guidance range for the quarter, although the geography was a little different.\nFor the balance of the year, we continue to believe that tax is going to be now we think in the 24% to 25% range, which will get you up to about call it 24% for the year. We had previously guided 25% to 26%. So we're getting about a 1-point improvement in the tax rate largely offset by the proton gross profit.\nAnd I think, we said last quarter, the biggest unknown in this whole \u2013 doing the discontinued operations and spinning out of Varex, the tax rate was kind of the cloudiest, if you will, for us to see.\nThe good news is we were able to shave out a point. And again, we think the full year closer to 24%, which should be sustainable going forward. So in the guidance, again because we got an improvement in the tax rate, the gross profit for the year for protons, we're losing somewhere around $6 million or $7 million. So that tax is an offset to that.\nThe gross profit for Oncology, right in line with what we were expecting in the call it the 44% to 45.5% range, SG&A, maybe $1 million or $2 million high, but within our expectations. So we simply raised the midpoint at this point in the quarter from $3.00 to $3.02 for the balance of the year and came off the low end of that guidance number. Does that answer your question?\nDow R. Wilson - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.\nYes, I think on the revenue side, really on the timing of protons...\nElisha W. Finney - Varian Medical Systems, Inc.\nYes...\nDow R.

For this quarter we had some easy comps so the first half as you recall, our first half of 2016 was soft so for the second half we've got some tough comps and so the 3% to 4% is what we were anticipating for fiscal year 2017.\nClarence Verhoef\nYou know second question on operating margins I'm sorry so I will take that.

Along those lines a little bit maybe one additional bit of information where you'll get more visibility to this as we will file a 10-Q for Q1 at the end of February and it's going to have a lot more breakdown of that and we'll be able to give you a little more color on the one time separation costs that are included in there."]], ["Okay and then separately I think you mentioned that you were seeing some positive signs of a market recovery in Japan and I think that's kind of the first time I've heard that in a while.

Our shares have been good there too."]], ["Good, alright, so let me ask two hopefully quick questions and then I think I'm more confused after we went through the questions with Anthony but I want go through few numbers here if I could but first Dow just on the Proton business, you write down some of the scripts business, you gave a number that you still have $131 million exposure out there, what is the risk to that exposure number one? ", ["Great questions. So the total exposure as I said is $130 million. We've got $60 million remaining to CPTC in San Diego. We've got $50 million outstanding sub debt to Maryland and we've got $20 million of sub debt to New York. So those are the three that we have outstanding. I'd say feel very good about New York and Maryland and where they are. Large centers, Maryland is coming up to speed very, very quickly, fastest ramp. We believe in Proton Therapy, they're now doing 60 to 70 patients. They've got one more BeamLine coming on next month which should reduce the patient volume again a little bit more.\nIn terms of appetite for more of these, these are all very large centers. I'd say that we don't have much appetite for large centers but we still look to use the balance sheet where there is a lower breakeven point, a smaller center, where we're a partner with reputable financing partners, where we're not the largest lender and where we're working with clinical partners who are leaders in their markets. So, for example in the case of both New York and Baltimore we are working with local leaders in their markets and that makes a big difference.\nAnd then of course we want I think the deal structure on this one was a little bit unique. We did it in 2011. So our first probing, show site, and in any case I think we want to make sure that we've got a local partner with some skin in the game. Elisha you have anything to add there.\nElisha W. Finney\nNo, I would just say we are encouraged that big banks are continuing to finance Proton Centers. Varian has sold off as indicated a 120 million of loans that we had initially put on these centers. We sold off New York and a portion of San Diego. And the Muni [ph] financing program in Georgia from what we hear is continuing to proceed well. So I do think this is somewhat of a unique situation as Dow mentioned."]], ["I think between the two businesses, the net earnings and if we take the EPS out of it just because again the share count changes with Varex and that you're guiding to about 330 million in net earnings between the two companies, if I add that to the 105 million or so you're essentially guiding combined companies all noise out of it at somewhere around 435 million I think.

Q2 through Q4 when you run through our guidance you are going to see we are somewhere between call it 280 million and 290 million of net income for Varian.

And obviously, I would say, the themes are very consistent with what we talked about last in that regard, namely the secondary markets, particularly in the fourth as in the third, continue see on a proportional basis more revenue challenge. And again, that's where we saw supply come earlier and the need to digest those units come first. So as we look into 2020, that said, second, some of the secondary markets have begun to see that turn. And as Chris was describing where, for example, we are focusing some of the capital, those would a good opportunities to spend targeted capital there. On the other hand, primary markets, so these are broad brush, you have to get of course get into specifics, but primary market is where supply came later and the digestion will come later, put it that way. And so we will expect in 2020 to see some of those primary markets having to deal with that supply. But at the end of the day, it's just timing because the trends are inexorable. We see the demand growth. We see the penetration growth. The starts trend, which has been favorable now for several years, those come together and manifest themselves in the upside that we keep talking about.

I would call it the multiplier effect that he is going to bring operationally and strategically for the portfolio. And so we are excited about that.

And even the boots on the ground as I described the operators were surprised by the nature of the change.\nAnd particularly, the occupancy trend in September, which we highlighted in the prepared remarks. And so it's really that dislocation as we then review the outlook \u2013 the entry into Q4, the outlook for the year that changed and those circumstances changes pretty rapidly.\nSo what are we doing about it, the second part of the question. Certainly at an operational level, all of the operators are actively engaged in, I'd call them, asset-by-asset recovery plans, very much focused on revenue. And we continue to engage with them on that.\nAt a portfolio level, clearly, there are different options we have, including selective dispositions of potential underperformers as we look forward and see the profile in various submarkets.

I mean the start point of where you finish as we're seeing in the fourth quarter fundamentally determines where we are in 2020 and we've lowered that start point. So that\u2019s a fundamental input obviously into 2020.\nLet's use the midpoint for easy math sequentially to the second part of the question which is a $0.96 in third quarter becomes $0.91 and $0.92 with rounding depending if you round up or 9 run down in the fourth and what's driving that and number one most notably is SHOP and property.\nAnd that is the largest driver. We highlighted in the third quarter, we also had a term fee in R&I of roughly a $0.01. And between those two things, therefore, property and that term fee, you bridge the gap.

In fact, we see as of this call last quarter, that's in the third quarter when you adjust for that, that's $0.96. As you say, the implied midpoint when we look at the fourth quarter is approximately $0.94. What's going on there? The key as we think about and this is the first half and second half conversation, but most no evidence in the fourth quarter is the cumulative impact of the dispositions that we've seen over the last year, including the LHP repayment, including the Kindred dispositions of last year, effectively using those pre-proceeds to retire debt.

So it is true that there continues to be interest in the assets and interest in developing as we talked about with the Related high-end urban developments, and that continues.

So, it's playing out pretty much as we thought.\nOccupancy has been at the better end of our guidance range both in the second quarter and trending early, very early, here in the third quarter to be the same.

We were lucky to be able to buy $200 million of the bonds, which we think is a good risk adjusted return, and also is supportive of Ardent, even though we were basically reducing our loan book total by over $500 million.\nIn terms of real estate, as you know, Ardent has doubled and they have taken on some really good opportunities in two markets where they have significant market share in partnership with the leading academic in those markets. And over time those may be potential real estate investments, but for now, the best approach is to first streamline the capital structure, which is what they did, and reduce the cost of debt. And then bring their operating magic to the two most recent acquisitions which gives us and them opportunities as those assets really get to peak operating EBITDA levels."]], ["That's helpful and then I just wanted to ask you a question on the reported core FFO, and this may just been a mistake on our part that your guidance did anticipate essentially an $0.08 prepayment fee for the Ardent loan, that was kind of baked in.

As you noted, the Kindred fees,\u00b8$0.03, expect that in the third quarter, back in February in terms of the fees year-on-year. But at the same time, back in February, highlighted the impact of dispositions including LHP and the loan repayment associated therewith, and there was as $0.10 decline that we talked about which is a net decline year-on-year, in part, netted out by those fees that we received in the quarter the $0.08.\nSo they've always been in the guidance, in that bucket if you like back in February.

And so, I do think you can make a case that it should be core asset and have cap rates.\nAlong the lines of multifamily, there is some countervailing data or analytics you could argue, but in general I feel that the resilience and the cash flow profile and the demand profile, both of which by the way are demographically driven, are very similar."]], ["And just shifting gears to the acquisitions, I know we focused a lot on the development and redevelopment pipelines and specifically that's centered around the life science and university opportunity.\nYou guys have grown significantly in that arena in the past two years I believe it's up 40%.

This is actually a beautiful inverse of that where we are getting great risk adjusted returns from really highly rated well capitalized companies.

", ["Yes, and that's exactly what we factored into, what we were talking about before in terms of there is a very specific guidance provided by Kindred, who is the leading LTAC operator of what the mitigated and unmitigated impact is and what are share is expected to be as it effects coverage and the 2018 CMS rule is perfectly in line with our projections and Kindred\u2019s expectations.\nKindred is mitigating the impact, again as we talk about how operators do this through taking more site neutral patients and that's becoming an important part of the business driving volume and then hopefully being able to contain cost. And so that is how Kindred has express visibility to mitigate the impact of those changes and again very well telegraphed and understood and it\u2019s up to Kindred then to execute its business plan within that context."]], ["Just wanted to go back to the SHOP conversation, we talked about the occupancy staying at sort of the minus 200 basis point level year-over-year, just given the flu plus also the supply coming online. ", ["Great question. Probably sound like a broken record here, but I do believe we have strong pricing power and senior housing both up and our approach as we thought about the base rent increases was looking where we had advantage positions, high barrier to entry markets with pricing power and pricing to reflect that.\nNot only in base rent but also in car provision and we did not see financial move out quote as a consequence of any material kind and that to me is really encouraging. Where we see -- clearly see pricing pressure is in the market where new supply is coming online and that's no surprise, that's as expected.\nAnd in that situation, we're a price taker and we need to make sure we're watching occupancy vis-\u00e0-vis price. And the good news for the portfolio overall and the high barrier to entry markets we compete in is that drives overall growth for the portfolio, but it\u2019s really a tale of two cities as you look at the different markets."]], ["So just thinking about same-store shop occupancy, which was down significantly 150 basis point that's more than NIC MAP Data would suggest but Bob you had mentioned last quarter you expected somewhere around 200 basis point. ", ["Yes, I think we certainly foresaw some of the impact here on the flu when we had the February call and that clearly is an unusual item as you look at the quarter and the sequential impact, there is always a softening in the first quarter sequentially, but that was exacerbated I think by the flu no doubt.\nThat 200-basis point range is really for the full year and reflects the range we've given of guidance overall. So, we're starting from a lower point. There is new supply coming online through the balance of the year and therefore that 200 basis point is part of the range of expectation going forward.\nNow I hope we can do better. I hope we have 160 now down. I hope we can tie in that gap and again that's what the operators are very focused on, but the range reflects that that gap being either consistent or slightly wider based on new deliveries."]], ["A question for you, on the SHOP portfolio, still trying to understand, it seems like you had said it\u2019s encouraging to you, it seems like it was just outright better than you expected in terms of occupancy and on the expense side, but I guess should we infer that is really just a timing issue that the flu has bled into 2Q in terms of occupancy.\nSo just trying to better understand that and then also if you can cut it through between U.S. ", ["It was a good quarter.\nBob Probst\nYeah absolutely, we were very pleased with it and let me talk about the markets a bit, thanks for asking. The Canada result continues to be really strong. 7% in the quarter, we saw similar growth last year. Occupancy is pushing 95% and we see real opportunity for further pricing there and we have a wonderful portfolio in that country.\nSo that\u2019s really powering and helping the business and similarly, I keep talking about the engine room markets in the U.S., New York, LA, San Francisco, Boston. We continue to go from strength to strength in those markets and the pricing is really taking hold there and that\u2019s really positive.\nThe other part of the portfolio continues to be the same markets and you know as well as I which ones those are and again, the competitive pressure we see there is on price. We see labor pressure there. So, all the same dynamics we expected are happening, but overall those strong markets are driving the business. So, we had a strong start. So, we\u2019re encouraged."]], ["Last question is one of the questions I get frequently from investors is what your appetite and what your view would be on acquisitions and being a consolidator in the market especially now that you\u2019ve got the ability to be a vertically integrated company outside of .com?

We\u2019ve actually made divestments in our VSS business. We are pursuing .web as a growth opportunity. We do have additional IDNs that we expect to deploy in the future. I think security and stability in our current growth plans that we\u2019ve talked about are what we\u2019re prepared to talk about. There\u2019s not anything else that I would speculate about or guide to. I would just say that as you heard George and myself comment earlier, the guidance that we\u2019ve given for 2020 does not include any provision for price increases, doesn\u2019t include any revenue from .web. So we tend to be more conservative in those areas and that\u2019s probably as much as I can tell you at this time."]], ["And then, just last question, given the results on the operating income and operating margin line for the first half, to get down to the full-year guidance would suggest some compression and operating margins in the back half of the year.

But year-over-year, our expenses are down by about $4.7 million, $91.4 million were end of the quarter. And the two big costs there of being down year-over-year, one is about $2.5 million of costs associated with VSS. We again sold that business last year. And then the remaining $2 million of that variance is really related to the timing of investments in telco and networking in our network. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks.\nAs we go forward here, we -- and as we say in our Q that's filed this afternoon, we expect that we will have slight increases as a percent of revenue for both sales and marketing, for cost of goods sold and for G&A as well, but we continue to invest in our network. We'll probably still spend some more money in sales and marketing next year, and we'll continue to invest in our cyber activities throughout the year, which falls in the G&A."]], ["And then on the vertical integration, the way that I read that if we look back through the history of Network Solutions to VeriSign to where you are today once upon a time you were both registry and registrar.

So .web or any other services that we offer technically are no longer covered with this modification.\nHow that language would apply to our business, how we would use it, how it stands today? I think is it's too early to say how that flexibility might be applied, if it's applied. But that clarification is now made and the vertical integration restriction only applies to .com.\nAnd you're right, we did have both when we acquired Network Solutions in June of 2000. And then I think it was in 2003 or early 2004 we sold off the registrar. But I think at that time the agreement read that VeriSign couldn't be vertically integrated. And I think at that time VeriSign and .com were entirely synonymous, so this clarifies that and it applies -- the restriction only applies to .com, and as I said, too early to say how or if we'll use that flexibility."]], ["So if I just do the simplistic and look at the cash taxes here for 2019, how should we think about -- actually maybe I'll just leave it to you, how should we think about the cash tax rate both in 2019 and going forward? ", ["Yeah, thanks for that Sterling. So as you know in 2018, cash taxes were about $85 million and that translates to about 12% effective cash tax rate and that's compared to our GAAP taxes of about $147 million, which if you do that math that translated into an effective tax rate of about in the low-20% range.\nSo for 2019 as you know we've guided cash taxes to be between $95 million to $115 million. And if you do that math that still would be below our GAAP effective tax rate. And that's the result because we're still using up some foreign tax credits and state NOLs. And while we don't provide a long-term cash tax rate, we do expect our cash tax effective rate to accrete closer up to our GAAP effective rate over the next few years as we fully utilize those remaining attributes."]], ["And then George, you have told us that you would spend more in marketing Q4 and did and then I know I'm dating myself here, but I would have to go all the way back to 2007 to find another quarter where sales and marketing expense grew this much in absolute dollars on a sequential basis. ", ["Sure. I mean keep in mind though on an annual basis, our total marketing expense is pretty flat year-over-year. As I talked about few quarters ago, we clearly look to execute on marketing programs, that we think drive the best returns for the company and sometimes those programs we have to pivot during the year and we had lighter marketing expenses as we've talked about in the middle of 2017 and we finally got some programs coming out. We didn't make a little bit of a shift away from some register our marketing programs to more direct marketing programs. We did some advertising for our brands both .com and .net both domestically and abroad. And so, we've been doing a little bit more direct marketing as a result of that. And those programs came out in the fourth quarter and will continue to run in the first half of 2018 here."]], ["And secondly, since we are coming closer to the Cooperative Agreement date in October, any particular update that you can give us on the process that you're having with the Department of Commerce?

", ["Yes. So I'll start with that, Manav, good morning. Our customers are in various stages of considering how they're going to manage their own technical infrastructure. I would say in general, that our company has moved faster, probably considerably faster in modifying our compute environment relative to our customers. But it doesn't really create an added burden for our customers or put more cost into the system as we work with them. In fact, if anything, the interface between us and the customer becomes a little bit easier to manage. So there is no systemic increase in cost. We -- obviously, as we've talked many times, we are adding the cloud dimension to our business even as we are working to retire the premise dimension of our business. The premise dimension comes off sort of in shelves, the cloud, it sort of grows in a linear fashion as Eric said before. But we've absorbed all that into our P&L and are just -- we continue to head in the same direction at the same pace. And so it all feels very organic. With customers; it's really nothing, but good for customers. And it doesn't add an additional burden for them.\nAnd Lee, I don't know, if you want to just talk a little bit more about the specifics.\nLee Shavel\nSure. And Manav, thanks for the question. I appreciate that. Very simply, we aren't providing an estimate of the cost savings for a couple reasons; one is that this is a multi-year project as we are rolling out these transitions across many data sets, many individual businesses. And while we're tracking it on each of those bases, and we look at each of those situations as test cases, where we can see the savings, we can see the return on capital for the investments that we're making because of the rolling impact of us achieving some savings, investing in the transition over time. We don't want to create a fixed benchmark. I think from our perspective, our view is that, this activity will generate both operational improvements, in terms of lower OpEx relative to this function.\nAnd so there will be a margin benefit that supports our overall margin improvement objectives as well as EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth as well as capital efficiencies that will boost our return over time. But given that it is deeply embedded within our businesses and something that we're managing as part of their full technology spend, it's not something that at an aggregate level we are going to provide that full estimates for that reason. But we absolutely have seen those benefits in the projects that we have executed within specific data sets in the businesses and we will expect that to kind of roll forward as we prosecute this initiative overtime.\nStacey Brodbar\nNext question?"]], ["Scott, just thinking about your strategy of getting out of the data collection in aerial imagery and also the data hosting business in Argus, it doesn't sound like your view on the value of data has changed. ", ["Yes. Thanks, Toni. So, first of all, our view of the value unique data assets is completely unchanged. And actually if anything, I think going forward unique data assets actually will be even probably more rare, not that we feel that there is any, there will be -- we will take any step back, in terms of the volume, or the value of the data that we've got. So our view of that as a part of our business is completely unchanged. Data remains the oxygen in our bloodstream and it always will. So the two changes that we made; first of all, what I would really like to emphasize around the Vexcel transaction is, that we actually put ourselves in position to have an even better dataset. Vexcel was -- as we've already described, already engaged in data capture. There are also one of the globe's leading providers of sensor technology. And so putting together our image capture process with their methods and some of the commitments they already had to creating this image library. We actually have access. We will have access and we have access to a better set of images than we had before and that substantially improved economics. So it's merely about how do we get to the data, not, are we interested in the data.\nAnd with the move with the Argus Data Warehouse, that's a little bit different, because the Argus Data Warehouse was not about our gathering of data from customers. It was really customers who would observed our facility with dealing with their data and they said, can you essentially white label your way of managing data to me. And we said, yes, as another benefit for our customers. And what happened over time is, this whole space of hosting data warehouses in particularly cloud-enabled has just sort of exploded over the last several years. And it was never founded -- the ADW [ph] work was never founded upon, providing us a data source which we then translate through our analytics. It was really more of an accommodation for our customers in their own workflows. So there's really no change in terms -- well, there is zero change, in terms of our access to data in the Financial segment. So, we view data as we always have. We have as much or better access to data than we used to and our economics have improved as a result of these changes that we made.\nLee, anything you could add to that?\nLee Shavel\nYes. Toni, to give you some sense that from a financial impact standpoint, I understand, you want to get a sense from a revenue perspective, that we would kind of roughly estimate approximately on -- in the fourth quarter there were approximately $8 million of revenues associated with the image capture business that will be moving to Vexcel. So that gives you kind of some sense of the scale. From an EBITDA standpoint there is not a material impact from the impact of those revenues. So kind of roughly equivalent level of EBITDA expense associated with that. But on a year-over-year basis, we are expecting the benefit of eliminating the costs associated with the individuals and the flight operations associated with that image capture business that we will no longer continue to bear, even though we will continue to have access to all of that data on very preferential terms looking ahead. So, it will clearly be a benefit to us from an EBITDA perspective."]], ["So a quarter ago, you'd talked about in the loss of revenue from the injunction not having enough time to really get at or reduce those costs, and yet the Insurance margin was quite strong. ", ["Yes. Thank you, Gary. So a lot of elements, I'm here, so let me try to give you a couple of components of that. So I think the statement that we made in the third quarter with regard to not being able to make substantial headway on the expense for Geomni in the fourth quarter is accurate kind of specific to the overall entity within our GAAP results. Naturally, the Vexcel transaction will be moving a substantial part of that expense, not all of it, we will have operating expenses associated with our analytics component of that business that will be retained. But in excess of the majority of the expenses will move out of the business. But the margin uplift with Insurance really wasn't driven by cost savings within Geomni. I think it was just the natural operating leverage within the business as a whole.\nAnd specific to the energy and specialized markets discussion there our market and cost intelligence business and the strong growth that we experienced within that business as well as cost discipline at Wood MacKenzie was really the primary contributor to the margin expansion within that business and for the business as a whole. And so there we are benefiting from a very strong growth in that product and relatively low associated expansion within that. So I think that is when we look at that margin strength there were certainly some component of it within Insurance. But a lot of that benefit came from those activities.

", ["Sure. So, I'm going to -- I'll take a first cut at it. And I'm sure Mark can provide some broader perspective on it. So, I think, as it relates to the InsurTech dimension, our view is that it contributes to incremental growth across two dimensions; one is that we have a group of new clients that we are serving in a traditional context with our industry-standard products and other data sets. But the other dimension is that they are bringing innovation, new ways of doing things that is putting more of the focus around our traditional customers to utilize data more intensively than they may have in the past. And that is creating new opportunities for us to develop products to support their needs. And our LightSpeed suite of products is probably a perfect example of that dynamic. And so it is -- I would describe it one level as accelerating the demand and the expansion of analytic objects in demand for platform analytics that has enabled our underwriting and rating business to generate levels of growth as you've seen in this quarter and that probably wouldn't have been expected two years or three years ago. So I think that's one dimension of it. And we've spent a lot of time thinking about the life opportunity, and I'll hand it over to Mark to describe how we see that opportunity influencing and providing incremental growth for us.\nMark Anquillare\nSo let me basically say it this way, I think, there's two types of InsurTech's. One is, I'm an insurer or probably a managing general agent on underwriting business or at least trying to find business. There what they are looking for is to get into business fast and automate. And that drive towards automation, drive towards technology has been a wonderful opportunity for us. And we have had some great sales there and it is accelerated growth across all of Insurance. There's also InsurTech, but they're trying to do some technology around data and information, and although probably on the outskirts could be competitive over time. So we certainly keep track of them.\nI guess the theme that I'll bring out, which kind of may tie together a couple of questions is, our customers are interested in content, that's King. But at the same time, they're pushing towards automation. They want is seamless ecosystem. So they can tap into any data, or any solution, whether it's their own or third-party. And they expect through a series of APIs and micro services to be able to consume that information or consume that application in a very seamless way. And I think that is a large part of why we're thinking that the fast acquisition will help us quite a bit. It is that light touch, quick implementation, low upfront cost, that life insurers are looking for. And we see the same thing, probably P&C is a little bit of ahead from an analytics perspective, but we see the same thing for our P&C customer. So, hopefully that provides a little broader color."]], ["And the question I had was to see, if we could get an update on the new product pipeline specifically around loan verifier, also some of the Life Insurance underwriting products? ", ["Why don't you take those on, Mark?\nMark Anquillare\nSure. So let me kind of walk through those. I think you were talking about loan verifier. You were talking about Life Insurance and some unstructured data. So let me start with the final two, because in some ways they're connected. So Life Insurance, we think provides a pretty big opportunity for us. We do have some solutions already available. So think about our catastrophe modeling, what we refer to as extreme event modeling. We do work along longevity models, mortality shock model. Think of pandemic, coronavirus, we do that type of work and that fits into some of the Life Insurance models that are necessary and interested. What we're also doing is, we're doing work around model that it relates to specific underwriting decisions. So that is around partnerships with the medical inspection bureau, which represents a group inside of life around, I'll call it, physicals and health. We've done some work around electronic healthcare records and doing some analytics there. The two analytics that you're most focused on, we have done some work around tobacco. We've done some work around avocation. If you're kind of like the skydiving, that doesn't make you the best risk. And kind of combining some of the technology that Eric and his team were talking about with some of the specialists we have from an Insurance perspective, we have used some voice recognition technology, which allows us to understand things about your voice and whether there is an indication that may lead to tobacco use, as an example. So, hopefully you can kind of understand one small example of how it fits into a) a wonderful technology group helping Insurance business extend into Life Insurance. And FAST provides some of that. Hopefully, that responds.\nScott Stephenson\nMaybe talk a little bit also, Mark, about using imagery to interpret damage to vehicles.\nMark Anquillare\nAbsolutely.\nScott Stephenson\nWithout having to send a human being.\nMark Anquillare\nSo, I think one of the things that we would love to do is part of automated adjusting is do a quick look. So this is a what I'll refer to as low severity type of crash, small dollars, but highly frequent. You can do a quick review and make payments. So we have some abilities to take a look at images. Just think about machine learning and understanding a couple of things. One is the image legitimate and accurate based upon time and date and stamp and things like that. Was it manipulated? But we go beyond that to do a few more things. One, we're saying is, it's eligible or not. Should it be complete loss. And then two, if it's eligible, we can do a quick estimate as to what it's going to cost to repair it. And those are the type of things that advanced analytics provide to automate this process. And it's a quick way to do things that have typically taken quite a bit of time and effort to in the past. Great.\nBill, I think you also talked about loan verifier. Loan verifier is another important idea for us. What it does, though, with any of our really differentiated ideas, it does take us time to aggregate data. But what we are working with is, working with insurers to get information access to a lot of that information behind the scenes. So that we can connect those folks who are on the loan side of things, think of the banks, with those insurers who are kind of ensuring that risk and piece those together. Some of that information we have in-house. At the same time, we have a very strong standard stewardship approach to things. And we can only use data for use cases that have been provide to us. So we are working with insurers to validate the use case and I honestly bring on customers. So hopefully, maybe a little long-winded, but a full answer to your questions."]], ["On the Insurance and energy side, maybe you could talk about the differences in the demand backdrop heading into 2020 versus 2019, either from a pipeline, or necessity on your customer part perspective? ", ["Yes. So let me just give you the perspective that really explains Verisk Analytics. We have -- and this has been true for a long period of time. Our company has grown faster than the end markets that we serve. And the reason is that our customers are rotating their own budgets in the direction of what it is that we do. They want to become more automated. And they want to become more deeply analytic in the way that they run their businesses. So you will see a lot of discussion about the level of technology spending on the part of the companies that populate the verticals that we serve. And that in and of itself is a very constructive trend. But you have to actually take that pool of spending and break that down further into sort of data center, keep the lights on, sort of spending versus the platformed analytic environments analytic objects that we provide. And even within the technology category there has been a rotation in the direction of what we do.\nSo, if you're looking for explanation, in terms of where our business is, and where it's going to go, that is the driving force of what our companies are trying to do. And the fact that because of our vertical approach, we understand their issues. We have deeply intimate relationships because we sell -- in the case of Insurance, we may be selling up to 20 families of solutions to our customers. And from all this depth of relationship and all of the data that they make available to us, it is really the perfect place from which to try to think about the next thing that they need and work collaboratively with them to develop it. And that's why our business grows. The actual macro environments inside of Insurance and energy, I mean, they sort of wax and wane, a little bit. But I don't -- those will not -- in my view have explanatory power in terms of the growth of our business in 2020, 2021 and on."]], ["So can you just take a step back for us and talk about how you see the cloud and where you are in the process number one?\nNumber two, what you see the long-term opportunity? ", ["Yes. So, we -- yes, I mean so you really had there Gary the two categories of benefit that arise from rotating our infrastructure into the cloud. So, one of them has to do with agility and that has to do with we can compute anywhere around the world literally by going to our say AWS dashboard and turning on new servers. It's that easy and it's that fast.\nSo, the ability to spin up new products I would also say that our customers are increasingly interested in being able to interact with what we provide in a whole variety of ways.\nTo the extent that what they're interested in is the sort of API on demand kind of approach then being already platforms in the cloud just makes it even that easier for them to attach to it. So, you've got all those benefits and then you've got cost benefits.\nAnd so we're very much in pursuit of both of those. With respect to where we are in the journey, so you're right.

", ["Yes. So, we -- yes, I mean so you really had there Gary the two categories of benefit that arise from rotating our infrastructure into the cloud. So, one of them has to do with agility and that has to do with we can compute anywhere around the world literally by going to our say AWS dashboard and turning on new servers. It's that easy and it's that fast.\nSo, the ability to spin up new products I would also say that our customers are increasingly interested in being able to interact with what we provide in a whole variety of ways.\nTo the extent that what they're interested in is the sort of API on demand kind of approach then being already platforms in the cloud just makes it even that easier for them to attach to it. So, you've got all those benefits and then you've got cost benefits.\nAnd so we're very much in pursuit of both of those. With respect to where we are in the journey, so you're right.

", ["Sure. So let me try to take those and you already ask them. So first of all, I think the general macro environment has been -- needs to be positive. There is a hardening in the market, especially around some of the commercial lines. Over the years, we have distanced our pricing from the actual premium. So if you have this history, I will tell you we are much more thoughtful about long-term contracts and -- but there is a little bit of a pull associated with more premium and there's more utility of the solutions.\nSo, there's a little more value on pricing that we would gain. But I think the bigger macro trend is as the markets harden everyone is kind of focused on the top line and growing it profitably. So the use of our solutions, I think continues to expand. People look to go into different lines and grow. And purchase is more easily -- it's easier to get through procurement in an environment where growth is happening.\nSo those are kind of the general trends that affect us inside the market. I would also tell you from a macro perspective the industry is very much focused on big data analytics. So we're right in the wheelhouse there. They're focused on automation. They're trying to become more efficient. There's a lot of technology projects in search of automation. That works to our advantage as well.\nAnd finally, where we're trying to play more is inside the world of digitization. They're trying to make sure that their digital engagement with their policyholders continues to grow. And we had some solutions that help them.\nI don't want to make this too long. On the sort of reinsurance side, we do see an opportunity or at least more consolidation among reinsurers. When that happens, it does cause a little bit of a challenge as we kind of renegotiate with the combined entity.\nBut generally, we have seen increased engagement with insurers and reinsurers on the extreme event modeling side of things. There has been kind of a little bit of a turn, where people are coming and moving towards our AR models and that is a broad kind of industry trend that we are very happy with and I think they recognize the power of the Touchstone platform that Scott was referring to earlier. I hope that responds to your question."]], ["I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what the second shelf that you're referring to looks like, either from a margin or cash flow perspective. ", ["Yes. So maybe, Lee, you'd like to conclude and respond to that. But I'll just open by saying that there are really sort of two discrete things that go on as we hit these shelves. So one of them is -- and I'm pretty sure we've talked about this before, there's been a mainframe intensity to the way that we compute at Verisk.\nThat's because of our long legacy as an extremely data-rich company. And when this company first got going the mainframe configuration was very definitely the logical way to try to manage large data sets. But that's not true anymore. There has been change there.\nSo one of the shelf-creating developments is when we retire mainframe capacity and that is an ongoing activity. So that's one. And then, the second is, when we close data centers and that also will contribute shelves at moments in time as we go forward.\nThere are really no trade-offs, actually. I mean, in -- as I've said before, obviously, we build in a linear way the cost associated with cloud computing. But when I say there are no trade-offs I'm really saying two things. One is, the unit economics of computing in the cloud are just superior, period.\nBut the second thing is, actually, and Lee mentioned this when he took on the topic before, we actually are taking this opportunity to think about the very nature of our platforms. Literally, how does the calculation work? And as we move things up into the cloud, we're actually sort of peeling open the applications and reconsidering, you do this, you do this, then you do that, are there ways to be more efficient in capacity.\nAnd so, it's actually a very constructive exercise. We just have to continue to be vary in touch with the way that the algorithms tool and the way that the -- the very nature of our data and how we put together our data sets. So there are no trade-offs. Actually, it's constructive microeconomically. It's constructive in terms of responsiveness to customers. And actually, we're just treating it as a journey to tighten up a lot of things about the way that we operate.\nMark Anquillare\nAnd the only thing that maybe I'll use, tiers or shelves, there's a lot of investment that's required to do it right, right? You need to make sure you tune the application, so you use the cloud properly, so you don't overuse the processing time and effort. And as you transition, besides kind of this code rewrite, you're also taking advantage of cheaper database management systems and things like that.\nSo there's a ramp-up of cost before you see the benefit. And some of those are kind of trading off inside of our P&L and CapEx. And I just want to share that perspective with you about the timing of the shelves."]], ["I would assume that, Geomni kind of continuing to be more and more profitable and the data centers shifts going on.\nAnd we're moving towards the second shelf, that the margins would naturally start to improve. ", ["Yeah. So let me try to kind of give some context around that. So, I think, what you heard in Scott and Mark's comments are, that yes there certainly is a cost savings in terms of achieving the shelves. But also it is kind of the net effect of taking on the cloud costs, and then also optimizing the business.\nAnd so, there is a complicated dimension to this. I want to underscore one thing. There clearly is a margin opportunity for us. But it consists both of greater OpEx efficiency, but also overall improvement in the operating leverage of the business itself in terms of what the applications can do and their ability to integrate other data and expand that.\nAnd again adding another layer of complexity, we have a large number of products and businesses that we are moving to the cloud of how applicable cloud is to what they do, and with different time lines.\nAnd so, it is impossible to extract what the quantum of that margin improvement is. We're learning as we go with each individual project tackling the biggest ones first. But we will see that positive margin improvement that we manage as part of our overall core objective of increasing margin over time. And then also investing that margin expansion to some level, where we are investing in future growth.\nSo, there is a lot of that. But it is clearly a very strong component of what will allow us to grow our core operating leverage further. And I know it would be great if we could provide some quantification. But it's just too large a project. And too complex for us to pin that to a specific number."]], ["I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color and maybe help quantify a little bit what the growth of the underlying businesses that are doing well is. ", ["So Lee, do you want to start with just kind of, at the results level and then I can provide a little color on the context?\nLee Shavel\nYes. Sure. So Manav, thanks for the question. We saw solid growth in that, the spend-informed analytics and fraud and credit risk management. So we described that as north of 10% year-over-year growth in that. The portfolio management was in the mid-single-digits range. That obviously is kind of the core of the business. And with regard to Enterprise Data Management, that is where we had a year-over-year decline but recognizing that, that reflects some of the implementation revenue in the first quarter. So that effect is concentrated within that sector. And it also continues to reflect across that business, the ongoing development and some of the greater choppiness associated with a new and developing business segment.\nScott Stephenson\nYes. No, that's, and all I would add to that is that's one of those parts of the business where we've given real attention to try to smooth out some of the cycle that can exist there. But it is inherently a little bit lumpy year just because it's moment in time really helping our customers improve their data analytic environment."]], ["Just trying to gauge longer term, how should we think about a step change in your free cash flow when this elevated investment spend sort of comes down to a more normalized level? ", ["So Hamzah, thanks for the question. I think there is a way to think about it and it is, it revolves around CapEx. And so a lot of our investment takes the form in, of internally developed software and so that's captured in CapEx. And as we had discussed previously, a lot of the acceleration was associated with the ramp-up of Geomni and the purchase of planes and sensors to build scale in that business. And while we continue to invest in that business, it is at a lower level on, proportionally relative to revenues than it had been in the past. And hopefully, as you saw in this quarter, the capital intensity, in other words, the CapEx as a percentage of revenue, showed a decline relative to that level. And you saw in terms of the absolute growth rate a slower level of growth. And so I think that is one way to think about the level of capital intensity within the business. Beyond that, we have OpEx expenses associated with a number of our breakout initiatives and we expect that to continue to grow as we fund these new breakout initiatives across the business. Some of them are profitable, some of them are at an earlier stage where they may be lower-margin or not profitable yet. But across the board, we would expect that investment to continue to expand at a reasonable pace and scaled against our overall operating margin expansion that we seek to achieve."]], ["So I wanted to sort of get a sense of, if you have any color on how you're thinking about -- are you outperforming the market because of the products that you're providing? ", ["Neal, do you want to take that?\nNeal Anderson\nYes. No, absolutely, Scott. I think first of all, we see modest growth on investment of our key customers over the next 5 years, Toni. As I mentioned in the introduction, folks are now starting to look more at investment rather than being prudent on the cost side, which is a great operating environment for Wood Mackenzie. And as you know, the traditional strengths of Wood Mackenzie is the credibility with the market, our unique data sets, and then we're adding to that in terms of a really intuitive data analytic platform in Lens. And as I mentioned in the introduction, the launch of that in the fall of last year, we already have 29 paying customers. We continue to see that growth going over the medium term.\nScott Stephenson\nHey, Neal, just a thought or really a question for you at the contextual level, is there also some effect in the Lower 48? Maybe it's not so much about CapEx intensity as it is about kind of operating agility and the ability to rebalance your operations very quickly in the unconventionals. I wonder if there's just a little bit of a mix shift there also. Toni is looking at macro data sources. Maybe a little bit of the rebalance towards Lower 48. Maybe that's in the CapEx number a little bit also?\nNeal Anderson\nYes. No, absolutely, Scott. Toni, I was referring to global CapEx. Scott is absolutely right. What we're starting to see is a little bit more discipline coming into the operators' plane in the Lower 48."]], ["So as I think about Lens or, I guess, previously WoodMac 2.0 and what was talked about at the time of the acquisition originally, I think part of it, and I think you were referencing this, Neal, was related to the way that data is aggregated and automating that process. ", ["Neal, your favorite topic. Have a go.\nNeal Anderson\nThank you, Scott. Absolutely a big win this year in terms of margin expansion was that automation that you referred to. We began the rollout of Lens, which is a truly end-to-end process of reimagining which data sets we want to secure, how we automate the capture and the transformation of that data and then for our analysts in turn to add their interpretation and produce the products for clients. We started an onshore U.S., Lower 48, exploration and production. And we're currently in the process of rolling that out to the global upstream this year. And the second part of the question, we're always looking for new data sets. But the wonderful thing about this automation and bringing on a new Chief Data Officer, Nabeel Azar, is he is tirelessly looking for new data sets, be them in the public domain, be them through partnerships or indeed, other routes."]], ["So in Insurance, I think we've seen investment impacting margins, seen with first quarter in Energy last year, I guess should we view 2019 as maybe a little bit - a continuation of investing maybe a little bit less so than 2018 or how should we directionally sort of think about it and then outside of scale, are there any margin initiatives across the business like efficiencies that you're looking to drive this year? ", ["Thanks Toni. This is Lee. So I think it's - I would start off by saying, certainly all our businesses, we think have superb operational and operating leverage. And so, as you know, across the organization, our expectation is that each of the businesses will demonstrate improvement in margin. I think it's a fair observation that in 2018, there was a high level of investment in a variety of initiatives, Geomni, Lens, IoT and telematics, where we chose to make those investments and that - those obviously had a negative impact on margin.\nBut notwithstanding that, I want to reiterate as I mentioned in my comments that both - for the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole, when you normalize for the storm activity, we had margin expansion on the year-over-year periods. And so from our perspective, recognizing that storm revenue and the implementation revenue for TSYS was 100% margin, and so that certainly skewed that year-over-year comparison. We believe that we delivered margin expansion, as well as substantial investment in the businesses for that period.\nIn 2019, we won't have that storm comparison and as Scott indicated, we still see very attractive opportunities to invest. But I think it's fair to say that probably in 2018, from a scale standpoint, particularly around Geomni, it was a higher level, consistent with our CapEx guidance that was acceleration. We expect to see that absolute level of investment decline as a percentage of revenue. So we feel good about the opportunity to strive towards our goal of margin expansion."]], ["Can you and I think you mentioned is one of the growth drivers, I guess, but can you give us more color on adoption kind of competition for that product at this point. ", ["Sure. So this is Mark. I think your question is directed insurance and at the same time, we have been extended beyond that. So first of all, we've been very pleased with the takeaway we've had in the market, our market share is growing. We've won significant customers and many of them that is clearly contributed to some of the organic growth that we've talked about here beyond what is our fair to it as market share. We've also continued to add products.\nSo remember in the world of I view as a complete automated solution. If I was to take use imagery in combination with some of the scoping and what we reverted image the scope, which is the exact activate tool behind our in front of all this imagery we can really automate and become more accurate and more cost effective for those claims adjusters. Literally, we think we can double the productivity of the claims adjuster field forces that our customer saving them hundreds of millions of dollars, so we're seeing that.\nWhat I also like to highlight though is that growth is extending beyond what is traditional insurance. As you think about world of contractors, if you think about the world of, I would reduce mapping and construction, as well as roofing companies, all of those found use cases in some slowing down or innovative way we view some of the technology. So that is contributing to the growth across the board. Even outside of insurance."]], ["And I don't mean new relative to various coming new relative to the market or certain another way, do you have to displace solutions from the leading incumbents that have subsurface data already. ", ["It's a combination of the two. And it really hinges upon how much analytic content we get into what we do. So there are players today that will provide observations about a number of this sort of individual parameters that apply when you're trying to understand the productivity of real-time operations. So from one place you can get data as it relates to, for example, the completion strategies that have been taken for the individual. Well, there are other sources, where you can make sure that you have completely identified the leasing --the lease holding an ownership structure of whatever patch of land, you're talking about and then other places you can go for the heavy size technology work and on and on and on like that.\nSo part of what we will do is to increasingly make those kinds of those kinds of data available to our customers. But then, over and above that, what doesn't exist so much in the marketplace today is the - is really the AI machine learned expression of all of that data in quantity across heterogeneous situations. So that in an automated fashion, you can really make predictions and drive decisioning, and there we expect, because we're Verisk, we will be distinguished. How much those kinds of solutions generate completely original revenue streams versus how much they displace, for example, some of these bespoke datasets. I would say that remains to be seen. The primary point here is, there is the opportunity for differentiation."]], ["And then on the Insurance business, there's been some underlying acceleration and there is a couple of years where maybe it was growing below trend a few years ago and you called out some various moment in time factors at that point. ", ["Yes, so, you definitely understood what I was saying upfront. All eight of those trends apply broadly across our company, but specifically in the Insurance vertical. I mean if you just step back and you say okay, this environment - this Insurance environment, what characterizes it? The customer set is relatively stable. There are occasionally some large merger transactions and there are some segments like global reinsurance brokers, where there has been some of that seasonally. But by and large, the customer demography is steady. Regulation really doesn't change that much. Energy - excuse me, technology is a constructive factor, as it relates to a company like us, because back to the top, every - virtually every one of our customers believes they can grow faster than their competitors. And so everybody is trying to behave innovatively, and so that's, that's just inherently constructive for folks like us.\nAnd then if you think about all of the - the many references that we've made this morning, they are just new things that we're doing and bringing to the market that don't exist. And so it's a constructive environment. I mean, the United States Property and Casualty Insurance industry, our home market is the granddaddy of large-scale contributory data analytics. I mean it was invented that way practically. And so we really have this wonderful privilege of being who we are inside of that very constructive environment.\nLee Shavel\nThank you, Jeff. I think we have time for two more questions."]], ["Just a quick numbers questions, Lee, what should we be modeling for interest expense this year, and also the tax rate guidance that you gave us for 2019, is that something we should view as longer term? ", ["Yes, so on tax, I think based upon what we see right now, obviously, any changes in tax legislation. I think that 19% to 21% range is a good basis. On interest expense, it's not something that we give formal guidance, we - obviously that's going to flex based upon what happens within the business and our capital allocation decisions. So I think kind of starting with the point of just stability in overall debt levels and looking at the average rates is probably a middle of the way road to go. But I wouldn't give you any specific guidance beyond that, because that will adjust based upon our capital allocation decisions over time, I would expect that we remain within this - within this leverage range, absent any other material changes.\nScott Stephenson\nOkay. Well thank you all very much for your continued interest in Verisk, and we look forward to following up with a number of you, as well as those who are taking a new look at Verisk, based upon our new capital policy, including the dividend. So look forward to our continuing conversations with you. Thanks, thanks for this morning and your attention."]], ["And, Mark, maybe just in terms of some of the new products and so forth you were calling out, I guess, maybe the one area maybe you can just update us on is the telematics initiative. ", ["Yeah, thank you, good question. I think we are very pleased with the position we're in, where we've these really exclusive arrangements with some of the larger OEMs and that has cemented us. So now it's every day we have more cars, more miles, and better data on that exchange. The early returns are really focused on two things. One, there's approach on the claims side to be easier and helpful to those driving your automobile. So think of an accident occurring, first of all, is there some safety or public safety you need, ambulance, could we get you a ride, tow truck? Also, let us quickly through a hot and warm transfer notify the insurance carrier that there's a claim. So this is a first notice, all automated that is very attractive to all parties involved, and that seems to be probably the place we lead.\nSecondly, we have found that a lot of carriers are taking the data and the information that is coming off, we call it model-ready data, but basically they're using the data to model, and they're finding great lift in pricing policies using that industry or data exchange. So, early days, I think it will continue to grow. I would say that we all think that IoT is happening, but probably at a slower pace than what we've seen in Europe and elsewhere. We remain optimistic and we love the position we're in."]], ["I think, Lee, you mentioned that there's going to be sort of $3 million lower in the future quarters in Insurance EBITDA because of the interest expense recorded from that promissory note. ", ["Yeah, thank you, Toni. I appreciate the opportunity just to go into a little bit more detail on that. And so, you referred to it as the interest expense, just to be clear on the note, it was an asset that we hold. We were receiving approximately $3 million of interest income on that note. And the reason that it's in EBITDA is that under the SEC definition of EBITDA, you take net income and you add back interest expense, not net interest expense, so it's included in that calculation.\nAnd so since this was an acquisition-related activity and we want to certainly separate out the gain and the impact of the interest income for comparability, the gain has been excluded. And then to the extent that there is any interest income in the period, we have excluded from the third quarter of 2017 $3 million of that interest income from our EBITDA and in the third quarter of 2018, $2 million of the interest income that we realized before its redemption.\nAnd so the thing that we want for all of the analysts to understand is that going forward that that $3 million, which is in all of the segments, but the bulk of it is in Insurance, I would think of it at a corporate level of $3 million of EBITDA that comes out of our future quarterly results. Does that clarify things?"]], ["What are sort of some of the \u2013 is it sort of driven by the consulting strength, and basically do you think that the positive trends should continue in the fourth quarter as well as into next year? ", ["Yeah, so maybe starting at the end of that, Toni. The performance of that segment is really pretty broadly based, and what I mean by that is that it spans the kinds of solutions that we have traditionally provided, so sort of the core look at the supply chain of the oil and gas space, but also includes the upstream subsurface kinds of analytics, which are relatively newer for us, analytics related to the renewable forms of energy. And then kind of over-the-top on all of that, the digitizing trend that I talked about probably is differentially being felt more strongly in the energy space than it is in the others, because energy actually has started further behind.\nSo we talked a lot about WoodMac 2.0 and essentially sort of changing our own technical infrastructure, which allows us to interact with our customers differently. That's a constructive movement in the business, because our customers themselves are also changing their digital methods on the commercial side of their businesses. So it's really very broadly based.\nIf you were to think of it in terms of sort of what it is that's getting delivered and looking at where we have been in 2018 and where we're going in the future, we're always encouraged when we see consulting do well, because it tends to be a leading indicator of the propensity of our customers to be thinking into the future. And that has been strong, so that's an encouraging signal for us.\nBut as those of you who are familiar with our story know, most of the revenue is related to subscriptions. And over the course of 2018, subscriptions have advanced nicely also across several of those thematic categories that I talked about. So it's not really any one thing. It's really broadly based."]], ["Because I remember in the second quarter you talked about some regs about targeting within Argus that needed changes for the customers.\nAnd my question is, have those changes been made? ", ["Thanks, Andrew. Yeah, so to your question about the models, that comment in my remarks was related to Financial Services and Argus specifically. And what's going on there, just to sort of reprieve that real quick is, that in the face of mounting regulation, the amount of documentation that is required on some of your models, if you're a bank or you're a credit card issuer, have really, really ramped up.\nAnd so we have created some offerings that were pretty popular with our customers. And that summarized a lot into what we call a wallet-share model.\nAnd so if you're going to use sort of a wallet-share model, what the regulators have said is you cannot sort of operate that as a black box. You're going to have to show us what's inside of your black box. And so sort of the burden for our customers of opening up the black box really got sort of pretty large.\nAnd so in the face of that, what we've done is we have essentially disaggregated some of those models and sort of essentially taken the attributes which build up into the overall view, and that's what we're now making available to our customers. So I just want everybody to understand that's the movement. So the insight is still useful, but the way it gets presented has had to change.\nAnd then to your question, so in the third quarter of 2018, the net effect of moving \u2013 some of our customers moving away from the wallet-share models and moving into the attributes was essentially a drag on the revenue line in the third quarter.\nSo the transition is not yet complete. What that means is actually that there is upside for us going forward. We're feeling \u2013 we have felt, over the last couple of quarters, the burden of that transition. And as we go forward that's going to eventually even out or even move in the right direction."]], ["And one of the things, I think you said \u2013 you touched a little bit on the insurance industry consolidation and, obviously, you have seen that flow-through your business for the last few years, and then I think you made some comments on perhaps reinsurance.\nI wonder if you could elaborate a little bit in terms of how the industry is changing via consolidation and what specifically you think that means to your business maybe shorter term or intermediate term. ", ["Yeah, sure. So all the way to the top, just talking about what the demography of the industry looks like. At the top-end of the market, there are a certain number of consolidations each year. My emphasis here would be on the fact that it's really not a very large number. But also bear in mind that there are new entrants into the insurance space on a consistent basis and several of these are what get referred to as the insur-techs. Sometimes they're innovating based upon the way that they segment the market. You have some innovation in terms of, say, peer-to-peer forms of insurance, which are kind of interesting, but they haven't expressed themselves yet as particularly big trends. But think of it as an industry where, yes, there is some consolidation at one end of the market, but there is also entry at the other end of the market.\nWe have done very well with the new entrants. They find it really helpful to be able to make use of our methods as they get started. They're efficient. It helps them get into business quickly. It's actually a credibility point for them as they do their business, et cetera. So, as we talk about sort of the evolution \u2013 and this is very real-time what I'm describing here, these new companies come into the market, we find that they're very inclined to work with us.\nWhen consolidations occur \u2013 and again, my emphasis here would be how relatively few of them happen, but when they do occur, it's very situation-specific in terms of what it does to our business. There may be some cases where the two companies coming together, they're very overlapping in their use of Verisk solutions. And in that case, they very reasonably expect that like-on-like there might be some reduction in the total invoiced amount for the solution that the two companies were using and now the one are using.\nBut there are frequently offsets to that also, because it's also the case that one company may be using our solutions and the other company is not. And in those cases, actually, there's a very nice cross-sell opportunity within that same account. And so when we go through these transitions with our customers where two become one, we dig in very deeply and talk to them about everything that they're using that comes from us, and the things that they're not. And there can be an effect maybe in year one, although, not particularly large, and then on an ongoing basis generally, the profile of the account going forward, the growth profile is, I think \u2013 Mark, check me on this, but I think is generally about the same as it was before two companies became one. So we note consolidation, and as I say, it's very situation-specific, but it's not a major effect on our business. Anything you want to add to that?\nMark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nI think the only thing I'll \u2013 I think you were trying to get a little feel for it. I think we feel that 2017 on the primary side of things, it was kind of business as normal. I think there were some reinsurance mergers that may have a little bit of a headwind as it relates to more of our cat modeling business. That would be my high-level, short-term view of things, if that helps.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nThere might be a few more situations, like where AXA and XL Catlin came together, and that's an interesting one, because I think that one actually represents a fair amount of opportunity for us. But I mentioned that one, because that has sort of a global geographic markets dimension and it's also reinsurance sort of being layered more directly on top of insurance inside of one specific company. So I think you may see some of that, but that's actually the most constructive kind of consolidation I can imagine."]], ["But can you help us drill down into how we should think about the growth trend within the subscription piece, the high level number in the earnings release about subscription revenue, the percentage of revenue from subscription would suggest it was very strongly driven to growth in that segment by the consulting piece. ", ["Yeah, actually, quite a bit of progress is being made on subscriptions. And again, I think you do need to look beyond one quarter to say the year or even multiple years. But since we really called the turn on the business, which would have been \u2013 just referencing my notes here \u2013 oh, I guess, about 10 months ago or so, the progression of the subscriptions from then has looked very much like what we would expect and is very supportive of our view that this is a business which can perform above the rate of organic growth of all of Verisk actually.\nSo in the quarter, it happened that the transaction revenues were particularly strong. And, yes, we are working our way through one substantial subscription agreement that went off the books in 2018. We've talked about that. But I think that over intermediate and long periods of time, subscription revenue growth will be equal to or probably even exceed the rate of consulting \u2013 or just kind of they will both be very strong contributors, but what we're focused on is subscription revenue growth. That's the heart of our business.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nScott, maybe I could add perspective. I think, Tim, that when we think about the subscription growth and kind of the core subscriptions, kind of putting aside some of the breakouts, and the breakouts are also largely subscription-oriented and research-oriented, and we have seen steady progress in the growth rate and new subscriptions in kind of the mid-single digits category before we factor in the breakouts. And then we look at the breakouts and those have been very strong growth as we penetrated those new areas, and so that gives us confidence that moves us more into kind of the higher single digits range.\nAnd then on top of that, we have the consulting revenue, which, as you point out, was strong. Now, consulting revenue and the growth that we saw this experience was clearly a significant contributor to the overall growth. But we certainly see continued progress in that strength and in that improvement in subscription growth, supplemented by the breakout subscription growths, which are at a high level. So that maybe gives you some context on relative growth rates to complement Scott's perspective.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nI guess, a last point I would make is that a lot of the subscription renewals occur in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So to a degree it's not really quite surprising that the third quarter would be relatively a little quieter with respect to subscriptions."]], ["And I don't know if you were more describing why when you started presenting segment margins they were lower than investors might have expected, but I just \u2013 I guess I wanted to confirm that there wasn't some delay in those investments. ", ["So, certainly, there has been a level of investment that we've been making in WoodMac 2.0, as well as in the breakout opportunities that we have been investing in that have an impact. Those are proceeding as we expect. WoodMac 2.0 will be an investment cycle that certainly existed in 2018 and will persist through 2019 as we expand that platform. And that we are already beginning to see some benefits of that within the business, but there will be continued CapEx investment, continued OpEx investment in that through 2019, and so that's embedded in those margin numbers. And I think one of the benefits that we saw is that we had good cost control. Headcount growth was, I think, a little lower this quarter, having brought on some of the development folks that we needed on that front, and so that contributed to the clear improvement in margin that we saw in the third quarter."]], ["And then for my follow-up, Nielsen has been talking about how the GDPR regulation has been negatively impacting their marketing effectiveness business, and I know that they're a big user of the Argus data. ", ["Yeah. So, GDPR is a contextual factor for us, but not one that I would say is really interacting with our results near-term. And as long as we protect our data assets, the way that we have and I expect we will, I do not believe it will be a material impact going forward. So I can't comment on somebody else's construal of the effect of the regulations, but where our business is concerned. The primary effect of it, as we interface with our customers, is we have an extended discussion about contracts, because we need to now talk about the assignment of liability, at a higher level we always have had to talk about it, but we talk about it more than we used to. That's really the only effect that I see. And it's not material, it's not material."]], ["So, I guess, the first question, when I look back to the beginning of 2017, pretty clearly you've had a significant investment cycle here, 20-some acquisitions and a meaningful internal step-up, things like Geomni, the new WoodMac platform, et cetera. ", ["Right. Good. So I'll ask Lee to talk about margins in a moment, but with respect to the investments that we've made, very substantially they go in the direction of putting us into new categories of solution sets that we otherwise either haven't provided or we provided in ways that haven't fully expressed what it is we can do for customers. So, for example, the acquisition of PowerAdvocate puts us in a category of spend analytics for the energy vertical that we weren't doing before. The Sequel acquisition puts us in a position to serve the London market, particularly with respect to complex commercial risks, in a way that we weren't able to serve it before.\nAnd then all the investments that we've done in Geomni, we were in the category of interpreting remote imagery into datasets, into analytics for our customers. The issue that we had was we didn't have enough high-quality raw material. And so a lot of the investment, as you heard Mark saying, on the Geomni side was basically to put ourselves in a position to have a lot of great raw material. So, again, that is very much aimed at putting us into a new and different position for enhanced revenue growth on the top line. And then other internal investments, the same. WoodMac 2.0 will carry with it some efficiency gains, but it also makes us more capable in front of our customers.\nSo very much it is about contributing to incremental growth of our business. It's not about the maintenance of things that we already do. And that is also really part of our feeling about the likely returns of these investments that we're making, which, as you would imagine, revenue ramps, most everything we do is scalable, so as these investments mature and the revenues grow, I would expect to see it be constructive with respect to margin.\nAnd also, even if you look at more than just say a quarter \u2013 and maybe, Lee, you want to pick up here a little bit \u2013 yeah, we still see constructive progression in the organic EBITDAs inside of our business relative to the organic revenue growth rates. So...\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nYeah. I would just quickly add in addition to what Mark described to develop new sources of revenue growth or enhance the revenue growth that we're generating off of our data, we are also making investments, for instance, in cloud modernization that we think will yield overall improved returns on capital and improved margins for us. So we are making those types of investments as well.\nAnd we look at each of those investments on the basis of what type of return are we generating, whether it's through savings or through incremental profitability. So, thanks, Gary."]], ["Can you just frame for us how you think about the returns to the business that this investment cycle will deliver going forward?\nAnd, I guess, I'm wondering things like should we think of this as incremental to revenue growth or really just bolstering the business so it can continue to deliver.

", ["Yeah. So, Gary, I think it's important to understand your frame of reference, because what we do try to accomplish with our organic constant currency margins is to look at the business on an apples-to-apples basis, so that the business isn't influenced by those trends.\nYou will see in the difference between our reported and our organic margin that delta reflecting the impact of some of the acquisitions before we have a year-over-year comparison. And those also include some transition costs associated with those businesses.\nSo I think perhaps what you're seeing is a narrowing of the difference between that reported and the organic margin numbers, which I think reflects what you're describing, is effectively the business is now absorbing that. We still have \u2013 I think in the fourth quarter, we still have PowerAdvocate that is outside of that. So there still will be some adjustments for that, but we are narrowing that gap."]], ["And then the second question is, without being sort of on the inside of the business, maybe you could give us the top two or three drivers of margins at this particular juncture. ", ["Yeah. So from an overall standpoint, the important driver of margin improvement is our ability to leverage our cost base in our businesses, our data businesses, across a broader customer set. And so that's \u2013 the fundamental driver of that, an additional subscription of our existing dataset, however broadly we define that, is going to have a very high margin and one that is in all likelihood higher than our overall margin. And that's the fundamental dynamic that drives our confidence in our operating leverage and our ability to achieve that.\nI'd say beyond that, we are always looking for ways to become more efficient with the resources that we have. And so, Mark has been driving an initiative on looking at how we can be more efficient by leveraging our scale internationally within the business.\nAnd so given that personnel costs represent about 70% of our cost base, we're always looking for how we can improve productivity from that base, which is something that Scott emphasizes highly in our discussions with the business. So I think that's another dimension to what we do.\nAnd then from a technological standpoint, as I talked about, investment in cloud technology is something that we think has the opportunity to improve our margins, not just by reducing our technology costs, but by facilitating our development of products and our clients' interactions with data that kind of further extend kind of the initial dynamic that I talked about. So those, I think, would be three of kind of the things that drive our margins."]], ["And then turning to your Insurance business, if you look at the organic constant currency growth rate normalizing for weather from last year, it did still step-down from second quarter growth rate. ", ["So maybe I'll try to take that. This is Mark. I think if you were to actually look back on 2017, I think the answer really lies there. We had probably a little bit of a slower start to the year 2017, and we had kind of a stronger growth at the second half, so I think we referenced this maybe a little tougher comps in the third and fourth quarter just because of the nice pickup we had, some of it catch-up with first half of 2017.\nWhat I'd just like to emphasize, and I think Lee did a nice job of it, is year-to-date we have had a very strong year from Insurance. We feel good about the direction of the business. We feel great about the relationship and the level of engagement we have with customers, and I do believe that the number of and breadth of new solutions we have provides an exciting year forward. So, I hope that emphasizes and answers your question."]], ["Lee I know you spend a lot of time on capital allocation and in terms of your analyst days investor outreach maybe just frame for us how you're thinking about that going forward, have you guys thought about a dividend. ", ["So the way - what I would emphasize is at this stage what we\u2019re focusing on is starting with understanding capital generation where we\u2019re generating it, how we\u2019re generating it obviously optimizing that. And then looking at the returns on capital within each of the businesses and most importantly on an incremental basis how we\u2019re investing the capital that we have effectively to improve those returns and to support the growth initiatives across the business.\nAnd that's where it's a combination of looking not just at acquisitions, but looking at our internal investment through CapEx, through investments in our breakout initiatives. And really just enhancing that as a discipline across the organization as a whole with the objective of trying to identify as many attractive opportunities to invest capital. And I really think at the core that's what's most exciting about Verisk. The opportunities that we have across the business and to put capital into growth businesses in the analytics and the data management sector.\nOnce we are doing that effectively I think the next step is thinking about how we manage capital and at this stage we think about all of our opportunities to return capital. We as you saw in the second quarter, we\u2019re very focused on repurchasing shares, and so you see a focus there that is determined on a quarterly basis based upon where we see opportunities, but longer term we are certainly going to evaluate all opportunities. But we\u2019re really at the preliminary stage of just thinking about how are we generating capital and how are we deploying it within the business.\nThe final thing that I will say I think that you have heard Scott and Mark in several cases talk about what we see on as the opportunities and the strength of our three verticals, insurance, energy and specialized markets and financial services. While we are always evaluating M&A opportunities that can create growth, we are very comfortable with the opportunities that exist within those three verticals. There is not an expectation at this point that there's any additional vertical that we\u2019re pursuing."]], ["Are they going to be more acquisitions, are you going to add a third leg to the portfolio just broadly speaking I know the history has been a little different where you had a healthcare business than we bought energy now you're sort of focusing in on the core.

", ["This is Mark I\u2019ll maybe try to address it. Clearly the claims area benefits from the severe storm activities occurred back in last year third or fourth quarter. I think what we\u2019ve seen is as a result of some of that storm activity. We\u2019ve had a little bit of a continuation of services to be continued and provided to some contractors. And we\u2019ve also seen insurers the most part by more.\nSo I don't attribute first quarter, second quarter results to storm activity. I see the underlying business is continuing to be strong. I see the investment that we\u2019ve made over the last several years in new products and new services and the extension into - all the parts of the insurance value chain to be working.\nAnd I just wanted to highlight that I think we have a lot of good things going in claims and personally I wouldn\u2019t back it out in the way you just did.

", ["Well, first of all, I don't at all think that things are going wrong at Argus. It\u2019s a great business, which is founded on proprietary content just like most of what we do at Verisk. So it's actually a great business and if you were to ask me which of our three verticals over the next five years is going to turn in the highest rate of growth, I think there is a very good case to be made that it could be Verisk financial services.\nI actually find it hard to handicap the three of them. I think they are all going to do well. So, it's a great business of which we and I are very proud and provides wonderful levels of value to our customers so all of that.\nThinking about the last couple of years, as we have discussed in the past 2017, there were a couple of major relationships that cycled out. One part of that was the Federal Government consolidated its use of what it is that we provide and the other was a very large plan in the financial services were it had essentially been bulked buying some of what we do on behalf lot of the banks and they stepped out of their relationship and so underneath that we have been filling in with relationships with the banks individually, but that was a one-time effect over and done.\nIn 2018, you have to look across the difference segments of the business and one of things that is at work right now is and we did call this out last quarter also is the on the median effectiveness side, I'm going to summarize a lot here in just a few words, but basically the regulatory burden on banks includes really, really requiring a tremendous amount of disclosure around methodologies, which allow the discrimination of risk on an individual customer basis.\nThe size of the report you have to write to justify methods that you're using is really kind of astonishing. The banks want to do this differentiating and they find our method as valuable as it ever was, but consuming our methods in the form that we have traditionally provided them has just become backbreaking from a regulatory point of view.\nSo, we're in the middle of rotating right now, the way we present that underlying intellectual property to our customers. And so it's a moment where that shift is occurring.\nAnd then lastly, as Lee pointed out again, in 2018, not only did he note the grow over point with respect to the implementation that we've talked about, the couple of quarter delay in terms of actually getting it productive.\nNormally -- well, I mean -- and this a truth of the business. When we establish a new relationship, there's a big surge of activity for data integration purposes, and then there's very nice annuity stream kicks in thereafter. The annuity stream is kicking in a couple quarters later than we expected because of the integration issues.\nSo, that's what's going on inside the business. But our outlook on this business is over intermediate and longer periods of time, is completely unchanged.\nLee Shavel\nAnd Manav, just to add, I think -- as Scott was describing, certainly it's an understandable question. And we understand the frustration from a growth standpoint. I do think it is important kind of starting at that level to step back and look at what the elements are that are driving it.\nIt has been a chunky and a noisy business. We have been in the process of focusing on how from a revenue structuring standpoint we can make this more sustainable growth business. I think part of the story is that early on several years ago, there were a number of large opportunities that naturally we were compelled to pursue. And that's created some of the large component noise.\nWhere we are now, is looking at each of these businesses across the portfolio management solutions, enterprise data management solutions, and the spend in marketing solutions, and focusing on how we deliver sustainable growth across those.\nAnd when you eliminate the one time elements, and in this case, we certainly don't feel, we want to apologize about the upfront revenues. But I think it's important to understand that those are licensing and implementation revenues with the value of the subscriptions accruing over time that that's the underlying dynamic that I think we see as both underlying growth and ongoing potential, given the extraordinary dataset and the relationships that we have with our clients, and the opportunity to use that data to just broaden their applications.\nI know all of that is looking ahead, but we believe that that opportunity remains undiminished despite the noise that we've experienced here over the past couple of years."]], ["I recall, like, the year after you made the acquisition, at one of the investor days you talked about how there's already been investments made in a lot of new products, platforms rolled out. ", ["Yes, it's both. And let me give you one other contextual point also, which is, the -- of the three verticals we serve. And I'm talking about customers now, I'm not talking about us. Of the three verticals we serve, the energy vertical is the one that is least transformed yet by large scale data analytics for commercial decision making.\nThe companies are awash in technical data. So it's not that they don't know big data, but they haven't harnessed it the way that insurance companies and banks have, to drive their commercial decision making. And we knew that at the time that we -- in fact that's one of the reasons why we were so excited to get into business with WoodMac.\nAnd then of course the double tsunami hit in terms of the commodity price and to brag that with hard on a U.K. based Pound denominated sort of a company. So in the middle of these storms, we basically turn the sales and pull the boat into port. Now, the sky is clear, we're back out on the seas for sale.\nSo, I just want -- if folks haven't followed our story over longer periods of time, I just wanted to make that point. Because there's a degree to which WoodMac 2.0 was what we intended from the beginning. And it's -- we just know that it's productive to have a very nicely digitally based platform for all of your data, because you can build the next generation and then the next generation after that of products if your platform done that way. And I think that the WoodMac that came in the Verisk in 2015, reflected their customers basically.\nIn other words, sort of the volume and the speed of the data sets on the commercial side, were just not, it just was not the way that environment had been behaving. It's not that WoodMac was behind. I think they were reflective of the environment they were in.\nBut then the other part of it is, yes, it is responsive to customers because their worlds have changed. Essentially what's going on in the oil and gas energy space is that, you used to have these years under unto decades planning cycles, where you would have these bespoke offshore multi $100s of millions of developments and essentially every project kind of was on to its own. And so you planned in that context.\nWhat's happened is that half of all the incremental supply has been added in North America. And in North America, the business behaves very differently. You can be drilling a well in location \"X\" and you could say, I want to move that, 1500 yards over there, and three days later you can have a 1500 foot well. And so planning cycles have reduced to weeks, and days, and that's actually exciting.\nThe other thing that has happened is, it's not so bespoke, there are lot of people in the Permian, there are lot of people in the back and your position is next-door to somebody else's position. And so the intensity of desire to sort of benchmark and use that to tune up operations and planning is much greater than it was.\nSo, in other words, to be effective you have to be bigger data, faster. And that's the conversion that's going on right now. So you can also pick up with WoodMac 2.0 as being not only the tuning up of our own environment, but it's actually creating this capability to serve the customers on these faster cycles with a greater amount of benchmarking against like activities. I mean that's fundamentally what's going on, and that is customer driven."]], ["So, my question was more like, is this 2.0 initiative sort of driven by customer feedback or is this some sort of new gen you feel like it will help down in the future. ", ["Yes, it's both. And let me give you one other contextual point also, which is, the -- of the three verticals we serve. And I'm talking about customers now, I'm not talking about us. Of the three verticals we serve, the energy vertical is the one that is least transformed yet by large scale data analytics for commercial decision making.\nThe companies are awash in technical data. So it's not that they don't know big data, but they haven't harnessed it the way that insurance companies and banks have, to drive their commercial decision making. And we knew that at the time that we -- in fact that's one of the reasons why we were so excited to get into business with WoodMac.\nAnd then of course the double tsunami hit in terms of the commodity price and to brag that with hard on a U.K. based Pound denominated sort of a company. So in the middle of these storms, we basically turn the sales and pull the boat into port. Now, the sky is clear, we're back out on the seas for sale.\nSo, I just want -- if folks haven't followed our story over longer periods of time, I just wanted to make that point. Because there's a degree to which WoodMac 2.0 was what we intended from the beginning. And it's -- we just know that it's productive to have a very nicely digitally based platform for all of your data, because you can build the next generation and then the next generation after that of products if your platform done that way. And I think that the WoodMac that came in the Verisk in 2015, reflected their customers basically.\nIn other words, sort of the volume and the speed of the data sets on the commercial side, were just not, it just was not the way that environment had been behaving. It's not that WoodMac was behind. I think they were reflective of the environment they were in.\nBut then the other part of it is, yes, it is responsive to customers because their worlds have changed. Essentially what's going on in the oil and gas energy space is that, you used to have these years under unto decades planning cycles, where you would have these bespoke offshore multi $100s of millions of developments and essentially every project kind of was on to its own. And so you planned in that context.\nWhat's happened is that half of all the incremental supply has been added in North America. And in North America, the business behaves very differently.

", ["So Toni I appreciate you remembering the slide which I\u2019ve used it every year. We actually started to prepare for this day and this Investor Day I think we\u2019ve had similar positive results. I think what we've done as you recall we kind of grouped the number of products we have into about 25 to 30 categories. And our sales team have this - kind of this checkerboard approach where we\u2019re looking to do project - account planning across all the different products.\nAnd we have a little bit of - we call the competitive chalkboard we\u2019re trying to win business every day and we have realigned our sales force in such a way that we have a team that\u2019s focused outside of North America that\u2019s progressing. We have teams that are organized like our customer\u2019s personal lines and commercial lines and being able to sell a suite of solutions to the personal lines or commercial lines has been winning.\nAnd I think it gives them a broader perspective on what customer needs, a broader understanding of products themselves and those are the type of things that we focus on. We focus on customer retention, we focus on revenue from our new products or billings from our new products and a combination of pipeline and closed sales. And we look at it basically monthly with a deep dive every quarter. So that process those metrics continue to be positive."]], ["And is it an improved product that you hope drives growth or does it have a significantly different cost structure afterwards that impacts the margins as well as where are we in terms of the \u2013 if you will, the peak investment necessary to drive that project? ", ["Yeah, so maybe in reverse order, Tim. We're kind of right in the middle of it right now, so I think that we're sort of at the investment level that is required. It has both effects that you were talking about. So first of all, there's a \u2013 as you would image, a massive amount of data that's part of what Wood Mackenzie does. But one of the things that a modern data analytic company can do is actually more highly automate data extraction, data cleansing and then data integration so that all of the data sets come together in a way that they're easily presented to the analytic layer and you can build new products. And so there is an efficiency effect there which we expect to enjoy as we move through this 2.0 migration.\nBut then the other part of it is that \u2013 and I'm now alluding back to what I said in my comments, one of the big things that's happened in the energy space is that everything has sped up. If what you're trying to do is to harness competitive intelligence and make your investments and run your operations, everything has just sped up and that's largely the effect of the United States. Basically, sort of the old form was an offshore big development which would have hundreds of millions of dollars of investment and 5- to 10-year planning and execution cycles to get into business. Now in the unconventionals and the Lower 48, you can basically move a rig and three days later have a 1,500-foot well. And so planning cycles in a world like that are measured in weeks.\nAnd so one of the things that is necessary in that world, if you're going to stay on top of competitive intelligence and have really fresh and relevant solutions, is you've just got to speed up. And that will be one of the major effects of WoodMac 2.0. The other one is actually interacting even more deeply with customers' own decisioning platforms; more melding of their data with our data with other forms of data that we don't even use today. And so the \u2013 kind of the overall point, which is to help our customers make better decisions faster, that's always been the point and will continue to be the point. But by degrees, what we put out there will actually look different and be more valuable because of data integration, plus the deeper connectivity between our data sets and the customers' data sets."]], ["And just \u2013 the follow-up on, the Insurance vertical, the growth rate, I guess, this quarter in particular because the boost from the hurricane activity wasn't really the dominant factor there. ", ["Sure, Tim. This is Mark. I just want to make sure \u2013 we've been kind of reiterating the same that we feel that we're well positioned. We have a better set of assets and new products than we ever have, and those are coming to fruition. The other thing we've been trying to emphasize over the last several quarters, back probably the earlier 2017, was there were several industry consolidations both on the reinsurance side and the insurance side, and when that happens, sometimes that put pressure on us. There was this underlying headwind that we've been a little bit free from. So there's a combination of good elements that are contributing and I think that I would be remiss if I didn't mention we're doing a very good job from a sales perspective of cross-selling and we're seeing good activity, good integration and good engagement with customers."]], ["But given how much the growth has improved, are we just at a point in time where you've had a lot of new products come to market or has the spending environment changed in your view?

", ["Yeah, thank you, Toni. I think \u2013 so, first of all, reiterating that our expectation is to grow organic revenue above 7% and that we would expect organic EBITDA margin to grow \u2013 I'm sorry, organic EBITDA to grow at a faster level than that. And so your question goes to, to what degree are we reinvesting that growth in the business. And the way I would approach that is to say we are looking at individual investment opportunities in each of the breakouts on their merits in terms of the growth potential and the return on capital for each of those and we would expect that each of those individually would demonstrate the operating leverage that we expect for Verisk as a whole and to contribute to that stronger EBITDA growth relative to our revenue growth.\nAnd so in terms of the timing impacts of that, it depends upon those opportunities and when we put capital into them. Overall, over that long-term objective, we are going to expect to see operating EBITDA growth in excess, implying that margin expansion and that operating leverage. And so I think the variances around that will have more to do with the timing of specific projects and I'll tie that to a specific example. Geomni, for instance, is clearly an opportunity that we have been investing heavily in from a CapEx and from a compensation standpoint. That clearly has an impact, as I indicated today in my remarks, on our EBITDA growth.\nWe are expecting 2018 to be the peak level of investment as we've said before on that and so that will moderate over time, and so that should demonstrate more expanded margin as that tails off. Now there may be other investments that we're making beyond that, but overall we are expecting that margin to express itself and we will try to provide some context between how the investment levels are impacting that growth. Hopefully, that gives you a little bit of clarity in terms of how we think about it."]], ["Not sure if Lisa's there or not, but just any sort of changes made to how Lisa will run the business versus how Nana was running it, how basically the plan to maybe kick start growth up again. ", ["Right. So, Lisa is not here, but I feel comfortable answering on her behalf. We, as you would imagine, spend a lot of time together talking about all this. The path to growth is going to be the same as it has been. I called out in my remarks that three of the streams \u2013 revenue streams at Argus that will be particularly meaningful are media effectiveness, regulatory solutions, and data hosting, and so to really be a function of each of those streams finding their mark.\nAt this point, 25 of the top 25 credit card issuers in the English-speaking world are in our data consortium and customers for our solutions. And so just the building of the consortium now \u2013 it's really down to additional countries, I guess is the way that I would put it, and we're having some success there. But there had been moments over the course of the last five years where a pretty good contributor to growth was more issuers coming into the consortium. At this point, that's a little more established. So, that part of the revenue stack can grow, but it won't grow quite as fast. And so those are the three components, and that's not really a change from where we've been.\nSo we're really down to execution, and I referenced a timing effect as it related to the first quarter of 2018. But as I mentioned, the long-term view is that this is a business which for five years through 2017 grew in the low- to mid-teens. The depth and the power of our data asset is greater in 2018 than it was in 2012 at the beginning of that time period. The customer demography has not really changed, so we see a lot of opportunity for this business to grow."]], ["We appreciate the bridge you had on the margins, but I guess the question is I'm still surprised that you still have another two years of investments to go before a lot of this is done. ", ["Yeah, so there are actually two things here, Manav, and you kind of put them together a little bit. So let me pull them apart for you. WoodMac 2.0 and the breakout solutions are not the same thing. Breakout solutions are things that we're presenting to customers that they find valuable, which operate in their environments and help them to run their businesses and make progress, and Lee referenced those at some length.\nThose are relatively large categories of spending. The good news is that each of those, whether it's subsurface or it's power and renewables, we actually find good growth associated with those. We're very happy. Having sort of launched these things and given where they are in their progress, the margins will improve as they grow. The margins are not as high as the other things that we do today, and so you have both of those effects at work.\nWoodMac 2.0 is something different. That's about capabilities. That's about WoodMac being a 21st century, fully-equipped modern data analytic machine. And the data analytic work that WoodMac has done historically has been very unique and the content has been very unique, but the actual data analytic methods have not really been as strong or as advanced as those and other parts of Verisk. So our thesis, even when we got started and here we are now, is that the rest of Verisk could apply methods and help make progress. It's taking a while, and I referenced that 2019 would be sort of a moment of milestones with regard to all of that, but that will be the ongoing work. So you just need to separate those two forms of investment.\nLee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nYeah. And, Manav, I want to add one thing to Scott's comments just to contextualize this for you. The breakout opportunities in the Energy and Specialized Markets are entities that are EBITDA positive. They are generating EBITDA. They are generating real revenues and revenue growth, and so it isn't a situation where we're investing and hoping the revenues and the profitability will come. We've already demonstrated product viability, client acceptance and we're now in the face of driving to a scale level where we can see that substantial EBITDA growth given the operating leverage grow.\nNow that varies from investment to investment, but I want to give \u2013 your question goes to the level of maturity of these investments and our timing, and I would \u2013 I just want to make the point that these are generating EBITDA profitability and we are generating attractive revenue growth in the businesses. So they are established and probably at a more mature level than perhaps kind of your initial impressions were.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nYeah. Actually, there's one other point I want to make around profitability levels at WoodMac and that is you can actually see our philosophy at Verisk at work if you look at WoodMac over the last several years. And what I mean by that is there was a remarkable discontinuity in the end market in the energy space, remarkable. The industry globally \u2013 meaning our customers shed hundreds of \u2013 about 350,000 jobs globally. The choice that we made was that we're in this for the long haul. So we didn't slash head counts. We didn't penalize our people by saying, okay, there was this downturn, but you're just going to get paid a lot less because we're groping for a near-term margin impact. And I think we've been rewarded for that.\nOur performance relative to referenced competitors in the space with respect to growth has been considerably better. But this is our philosophy at Verisk. As much as our business runs on intellectual capital and it does, a lot of that is tied to our people and the greatest part of our cost structure is our people. And we're going to manage for the long term and that is absolutely what we've done as we've moved through with WoodMac. And so you can see that in terms of the choices that we've made in light of a very difficult external environment. We thought long term and we remained investment-minded and that's what we'll always do at Verisk."]], ["You said you were through that, but at the same time I think so far this year we are on pace as the highest M&A year in the insurance end markets.

It really gets to what models as an example use AR (00:56:21), if there's two reinsurers that are combining the acquiring company, what models they use could drive a better or worse outcome for us. And what happened as I described over kind of 2016 into early 2017 was some of that merger activity worked against us.\nYour referenced ACE/Chubb. Those are both large users of ISO services. We worked in agreement with them that I think made both customers and Verisk happy, but there obviously, in those type of things, does come some negotiations. So I can't really get all that more specific. All that I can tell you is the headwinds that we experienced are behind us. (00:57:25) things that have been announced or pending don't seem to have that big of implication on us going forward.

Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nAnd, Mark, maybe just picking up on the point, maybe you and I could dialog about two things real quick. So one is, in the ACE/Chubb situation is it fair to say that actually we're now looking at cross-sell opportunities that could probably actually cause the combined account to be bigger than it was, maybe even materially bigger than it was before the time when they were separate entities? Is that fair?\nMark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nI think one of the benefits we've of kind of taking our insurance businesses and being holistic is we've had these more senior-level discussions as Scott highlighted, and these outcomes are positive in the sense that we think we have bigger growth opportunities to cross-sell products and get Verisk more integrated and more product into those bigger customers. So we'll continue to look forward for the future, but I think there could be a very positive outcome.\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nAnd maybe get your view on one other thing which is the announced AXA, XL Catlin put together. Kind of my view is I think that that's probably actually good news for us because AXA, a more global company, has made relatively less use of what we do to-date. XL Catlin has been a very strong, well-established customer. I think there will be flow from \u2013 or there could be flow from XL Catlin into AXA. What do you see?\nMark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nThat was my specific reference when I said the acquisitions that are pending on the horizon probably are more positive to us and we don't see a concern.\nScott G.

Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nSo, operator, I think we have time for one more question."]], ["And then my second question is just more on these organic investments you are making and sort of the time of phasing in which we should expect some of the results. ", ["Right. So let me start here. And Mark, if you care to add anything. Because -- and something that I'd like to just highlight here is that Geomni and telematics both represent a very important theme inside of our business, and that is new types of data that can be pulled in for new forms of decisioning. And one of the things I want to say from the outset is that both of those data types have application in the insurance vertical. They also have application outside of the insurance vertical. So as you think about how we're going to monetize the investments that we're making, I believe what you'll see is -- I believe what we will see is that they will first express themselves mostly in the insurance vertical, but then as we go forward, they will both expand inside of that vertical, but also find ways to grow in other marketplaces. So that's kind of the general story here. So now back to your question then.\nYes, we're seeing the fruits of the Geomni investments write down very exciting developments. And so that's really very realtime. We're encouraged by what we see on the IoT front, but it's going to be more of a progressive build in terms of the absolute amount of revenue dollars which are generated by IoT. There are reasons for that, I'll highlight one, Mark, maybe, you'd like to add some others. So we talked about the connected car movement. I feel very, very pleased with the leadership that we're showing in that category. We are the leader in that category. But the rate at the which connected cars grow as a percentage of the total population of cars in the United States, that is a longer-term trend. It will take a while for all of the automakers to essentially have turned over their existing fleets and for all cars to be natively connected. So that's kind of a long -- a big wave, but it's a slow wave or steady wave that is moving through the auto world.\nThe effect of IoT in the home, in some ways, may be a little bit faster, but in some ways a little bit slower because of the value associated with the signal that you take off of a car is, in some ways, may be greater than the value of the signal that you take off of a washing machine or a toaster. And so I think IoT -- we are seeing IoT today. It's building, but I think it's kind of a long -- it will be a longer-term sort of a build. Anything you want to add to that, Mark?\nMark Anquillare\nI think it's well said. I mean, I think the vision is that the rating paradigm will shift as to how automobiles and more importantly people are underwritten in the premiums determined. And we hope to have all that information for every vehicle and every person. At the same time, today, it's a little bit about claims, and so it's a little bit about bespoke modeling to help insurers kind of perfect their own internal behavioral scores."]], ["So, Lee, I guess, when you put it all together, the organic expansion, but also kind of the impact of investments and the acquisitions, I mean, where roughly should we be shaking out for the margins? ", ["Sure. Thanks, Alex. So the way I would summarize it, Alex, and building off of Scott's comments, is that we expect, in 2018, that, on an organic basis, our EBITDA margins should expand. And that is a combination of kind of the total organic business, meaning the core business and the growth initiatives at Geomni and the chemicals and the subsurface at WoodMac and the others that we've described. And so the function of continuing to target the 7% to 8% organic revenue growth and continued improvement in WoodMac and Argus, we believe, will enable us to achieve that EBITDA growth in excess of overall revenue growth.\nAs it relates to the acquisition impact, obviously, that's a variable that is more difficult to anticipate, and the overall net effect will end up being a balancing of what we can achieve from an organic standpoint in terms of margin expansion, offset to some extent by the impact of the acquisitions that are coming on. And so we are trying to give more focus around that organic EBITDA margin, so that you can see meaningfully the progression that we're making in the core business. And then over time, what I would emphasize is that all of the acquisitions that we look at, similar to our business, have great operating leverage. And so that we expect that they will contribute to overall EBITDA growth in those businesses in excess of their organic revenue growth. So hopefully, that answers it. I know that probably what you're looking for is what is the net impact on the acquisitions to the whole, but that becomes that net impact between the 2. The important thing that we feel we want folks to focus on is that organic EBITDA margin, which we feel confident, will expand in 2018.\nScott Stephenson\nRight. And maybe just to add to that, I write upfront and then Lee also emphasized that we have benefited from the listening tour that Lee has engaged with our investors. And one of the messages that was very clear was that our investors, in general, would like to hear us talk with increased emphasis about organic results, organic revenue growth and organic EBITDA progression. And so you're going to hear that more as a part of our presentation. But we're very excited about the acquisitions also, which are contributing in 2018 to the overall top and bottom line of the company. And we're excited about the contributions they'll make this year and the contributions they'll make in the future. But you're hearing an emphasis on organic because that's what our investors have told us they like us to have.\nLee Shavel\nAnd let me add one thing just to allay any concerns. It's not because we don't want to be focused on the financial returns or the acquisitions in -- as I've talked about with a lot of investors, the focus there has to be, \"Are we generating good returns on capital for that component of the business?\" Clearly, it has a financial impact overall, but I want to make certain that we build on the disclosure that we provided at Investor Day around the performance of those entities from a capital standpoint in addition to the financial performance. And so I think that will be something that you'll see in 2018, where we'll be working to enhance disclosure around those components. So just wanted to add that point."]], ["I think you gave some commentary at the beginning, Scott, but I think the fourth quarter -- and I think you highlighted it at Investor Day, again, was kind of like the last renewal cycle post kind of cyclical challenges in the energy market. ", ["Yes, thank you. And you got me substantially correctly in terms of the message at Investor Day. Let me tune it for you just a little bit. So there are -- it's typically the case with WoodMac that there are a lot of renewals in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So the quarter we just went through and the quarter we're going through right now always carry a fair amount of meaning in terms of the progression of the subscriptions year-over-year. So you've heard the report about the fourth quarter, which was a positive quarter overall. And we're in the middle of the first quarter, which feels, I would say, substantially the same. There are some larger customers whose renewals are being negotiated right now.\nSo we're moving through that. But you got me substantially correct from Investor Day in terms of as we round out 2017 and into 2018. And I want to emphasize that there are a lot of positive signals at Wood Mackenzie. Lee referenced one that we watch a lot, which is the progression of consulting revenues, which tend to be a leading indicator of our customers' appetite for everything that we can do. And then yes, you also heard me. I think that '19 will be even more removed from the effects of the commodity cycle that we saw in '14, '15, '16 and even into '17. '19 will just be just 1 more year removed from that. And therefore, I do believe that, in addition to all of the new product opportunities and the cross-sell opportunities, I believe that the price mechanism in '19 will be more available to us than it was certainly in the '15, '16, '17 time frame. And we're choosing to be thoughtful about how we use the price mechanism in '18 as well because we want to get these new products sold. We want to enhance the cross-sells."]], ["And then looking forward, it tells to me like 2018 is still going to be a transition year, but 2019, maybe, we'll get to the point where this can be the fastest-growing business?

So there are -- it's typically the case with WoodMac that there are a lot of renewals in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So the quarter we just went through and the quarter we're going through right now always carry a fair amount of meaning in terms of the progression of the subscriptions year-over-year. So you've heard the report about the fourth quarter, which was a positive quarter overall. And we're in the middle of the first quarter, which feels, I would say, substantially the same. There are some larger customers whose renewals are being negotiated right now.\nSo we're moving through that. But you got me substantially correct from Investor Day in terms of as we round out 2017 and into 2018. And I want to emphasize that there are a lot of positive signals at Wood Mackenzie. Lee referenced one that we watch a lot, which is the progression of consulting revenues, which tend to be a leading indicator of our customers' appetite for everything that we can do. And then yes, you also heard me. I think that '19 will be even more removed from the effects of the commodity cycle that we saw in '14, '15, '16 and even into '17. '19 will just be just 1 more year removed from that. And therefore, I do believe that, in addition to all of the new product opportunities and the cross-sell opportunities, I believe that the price mechanism in '19 will be more available to us than it was certainly in the '15, '16, '17 time frame. And we're choosing to be thoughtful about how we use the price mechanism in '18 as well because we want to get these new products sold. We want to enhance the cross-sells."]], ["Can you break out for us, looking backwards, how much of that was deal costs and short-term integration payments that maybe somewhat less likely to recur versus just dilution from bringing on revenue that had an initial lower margin attached to it that will likely persist until you annualize these? ", ["Yes. Thank you for the question. Let me take the second part of that and then bump it over to Lee. Integration costs are really not material. And this is an enduring statement about Verisk. And the reason is, if you think about the nature of the integration that needs to be achieved, back to kind of the three buckets that I gave you upfront, when you're talking about product organizations, companies that have unique products that are now a part of Verisk, there are two ways that we link them to us. One of them is getting them on our sales platform, and that integration cost is about nothing. And then the other form of integration is, if and when we integrate the solution, so we have a preexisting encoded solution and the acquired company has an encoded solution, and now you're going to find a way to blend code in order to present a new integrated solution into the marketplace. And those are moment in time.\nGenerally, those will be accomplished relatively quickly. And in many ways, you're leveraging the development budgets you've all ready got. It's now you're just thinking a different set of developments because you've now got this bigger code base and you have to bring it all together. So the literal integration is not so great. There's a different part of your question, and here now, I'll turn it over to Lee for his comment, but yes, there are deal costs, for sure. And so when you do deals in the moment, there's all the lawyers and et cetera that have to get paid in order to bring the thing together. So there are definitely deal costs, but the literal tying together of Verisk and the company that we just bought, in an operational sense, generally is not material.\nLee Shavel\nAnd so Gary, I think the thing that factors into this is all of the integration upfront costs that we're dealing with that tend to be onetime in nature are an element of this, but there are also two other elements. One is, generally, these are earlier-stage companies, and so they have ability to predict immediately in the near term that -- their immediate performance as we're going through that integration as well as across the number of acquisitions that we have. I think it creates noise that we would suggest is not as relevant to our overall organic performance. And we'd like to focus on that as opposed to trying to predict what that relatively small impact is of those acquisitions. We -- as I indicated, we think that the overall focus should be on the capital efficiency and the returns from that business, and then what they will be able to ultimately contribute on an organic basis when they get folded into the business.

", ["Yeah, so the way that the imagery ecosystem works is first of all, you need to avail yourself as an insurer or an independent adjuster or an insured, of the ability to understand the asset and how it's changed. So one of the things that matters is your understanding of the asset before the event, before the damage, and so one of the things that is necessary is sort of a view of truth, which is what is there before the damage occurs?

", ["Yes. So the reason that the growth shows that we're \u2013 or let me make a more general point as we sort of get into this topic, which is that customers often have a preference for how they buy solutions, particularly new solutions, which is that they prefer to get into it in a transaction mode rather than in a subscription mode, because they don't exactly know how much of it they're going to need. And we're happy to do business that way as we're moving into a category which is either new for them or it's at least new for us with respect to serving them. So we don't consider transaction-based revenues to be low quality revenues, because they very frequently mature, they ripen into subscription agreements. So for example, in the Geomni world \u2013 and I'm just taking that as an example, today we're transaction-priced.\nOne of the plans that we have worked on at length has been as our offerings begin to mature, one of the ways that we can offer them to customers would be in more of a subscription mode, where you would essentially sort of be kind of buying the aerial imagery platform I guess is the way I would say it, without respect to any individual property that you want to look at. So that would be an example of there would be a progressive movement of what today is booked as transaction revenue into what tomorrow or down the road would be booked as subscription revenue. And that's kind of a normal effect inside of a data analytics business. It's very common for the customers to want to start out in a transaction mode.\nEva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nYeah, and, Alex, I was just going to add to that. I think, when you look at the growth rates, certainly the transactional growth rates were higher than the subscription growth rates in the third quarter and actually, in the second quarter as well. But if you actually look at the progression in that growth, you would see the subscription \u2013 the relativity subscription growth has accelerated quite a bit as well as has transactional.\nAnd remember, because we are 80% subscription, the dollars associated with that acceleration of subscription growth are really what's meaningfully driving the growth. I don't have the organic numbers in front of me, but I would say that generally some of the businesses that we're bringing in are a lot more transactional in terms of that. So I think if you were to parse that out of your transactional growth rate but down to organic, I think you would see a bit more balance. Although nonetheless, we have storm activity and so transactions, as Scott said, is good revenue. So we'll take that."]], ["Just secondly real quick, you mentioned the hurricane or weather impact will bleed into the fourth quarter, which is good, but how should I be thinking about this more longer term? ", ["There are three things to keep in your mind. I'll touch on the first two and Mark will pick up on the third. First of all, we said that the third quarter extreme events don't bleed into the fourth quarter with respect to revenue, so just hopefully everybody heard that and heard that clearly. The second thing to just sort of know about our business and obviously, we're talking here about insurance. We are very excited about where we're going in financial services and in the energy complex and I just want to continue to put that out there.\nBut in the insurance space, the anomaly has been the amount of time that has passed since the last major event, so you can basically go back and say you have Sandy in 2011 and then you had Katrina and the unusual thing is sort of the spacing in there, actually. So when you think about Verisk, one of the things that you should think about is that part of what we do for our customers is provide a whole suite of solutions which help them to be hardened against major events.\nMajor events happen. They happen not every year. We've actually been in an extended period where they didn't really happen with any frequency but that's the anomaly and so it is a part of our business. It won't show up every year. We'll see what the pattern is \u2013 and by the way, extreme event does not necessarily mean a hurricane, so there's also a sensitivity to for example, things like major flooding events in the United States, but they may not be atmospherically driven in the same way that a hurricane is, so you've got all that. But now having said those two things, I think what we also want you to just understand is sort of the very balanced way in which our insurance-facing business is growing. It's related to a lot of things, claims and new software platforms and so Mark if you want to just talk about that a little bit?\nMark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nJust, I think to your question a couple things that typically help us a little bit in the future (54:36) is an event like these our insurer and reinsurer customers take some additional thoughts around how and what they're going to do with regard to cat modeling, so there could be opportunities for AIR down the road, to the extent that someone (54:50) wants a second model and maybe a more comprehensive suite of solutions whether it's across different perils, or different geographies, that's an opportunity.\nWhat we've also talked about sometimes with catastrophes is that it does help pricing in the industry. From a primary perspective I don't think we're going to see a big upsurge in pricing. From a rate perspective reinsurance, it should bolster maybe reinsurance a little bit. That helps our customers' customers who are growing have more of an appetite to buy things. So that's maybe just another tertiary benefit to us, but just wanted to share those other observations. I think that's what maybe you were searching for as well."]], ["I guess to start off with maybe a two part question on just insurance; how meaningful is the strengthening capacity bonds to the growth that you saw in decision analytics insurance? ", ["This is Mark, let me start out Tim. Obviously, the cap on market was robust in the quarter, we continue to be the model choice and as a result that did help us a little bit. But I just want to make sure I don't -- we don't overemphasize how much revenue we get from the cap on market, it's certainly an indicator of kind of the strength of our AIR brand but at the same time we're talking a couple of million dollars over something overly dramatic.\nEva Huston\nYes. And Tim, I would just add that if we have not seen any growth in the cap online there, we still would have seen acceleration in the DA insurance growth.\nScott Stephenson\nAnd to your question Tim about aerial imagery, we've really been on this topic for some time now and much of what we've given attention to over the last couple of years have been our analytic methods. And so our machine learned methods for interpreting image sets I think are the best in the world and we've been working on those for a few years. What we concluded was that in order to assume the position that we want to, where this market is concerned we had to complement that excellence with equal distinctiveness with respect to the image sets that are available to us. To-date we've been working with third-parties and so this we see as really the final step in order to be fully prepared to serve this marketplace. And so it's not that we haven't been here, it's that this was sort of the final piece."]], ["First question just to clarify a couple of things on the aerial imagery investment; so in terms of the revenue opportunity -- you've been working on this since 2014, you talked about $200 million TAM on the insurance side I guess. ", ["Yes, so we've accessed less than 5% of that TAM today. So we're -- this is the opening minutes of the first quarter. We've been working on our methods for a long time as I responded to Tim's question but we feel like we've put the final piece in place here. But we've accessed 5% or less actually of that TAM, so very, very early days. With respect to the CapEx profile, there will be a sustained tail of CapEx because essentially the infrastructure necessary to generate these image sets always has to be refreshed but as Eva was mentioning before with respect to CapEx, '17 and '18 are kind of this bubble and then we come down to substantially lower sustained levels to essentially keep this network in the United States operating in perpetuity."]], ["So first question for you on Wood Mac, you had pointed out that the growth -- on an organic basis constant currency up about 0.6% but it's actually little better than that because EHS was negative against it. ", ["Yes, it's -- we're very encouraged by what's happening with the subscription revenues, that's real-time business and that is as with the way that we face-off with our customers and all vertical markets, when we come to a renewal moment it isn't just a sort of a raw question of price increase on what they were using previously; first of all, our products are always sort of dynamically changing but in addition to that we sort of bring bundles. So when we look at -- what we're paying attention to Bill is the subscription amounts associated with existing customers and obviously with new customers as well. And there has been very nice progression in terms of those subscription revenues. As Eva pointed out because we signed multi-year agreements it will take a little while for the full effect of what's happening right now to show up on the revenue line but it's progressing nicely.\nAnd as I said, just to be clear about this; you know, inside of the resource and energy world we don't need the commodity to be -- for example, if we're talking about the oil commodity we don't need it to be at the record highs, it was at a few years ago, we just need our customers to be stable and looking to the future which is actually kind of where we are now. There has been a tremendous reduction in breakeven inside the industry and so it's -- we just need stability and essentially there is stability at this point; so we're enjoying what's happening in that business."]], ["And then in terms of the moderating industry headwinds that you called out, I heard Eva's comment about reinsurance, I guess stabilizing, but could you just broadly characterize your view of the insurance end market right now? ", ["Sure. This is Mark. Good question. So let me start with the reinsurance side of things. So clearly, it's a very soft market from a reinsurance perspective, which puts pressure on our customers. That remains. At the same time, what we have highlighted is there's a lot of industry consolidations. When industry consolidations happen that also commonly interacts with our contracts with what is now one as opposed to two entities. That headwind has kind of almost cycled through.\nSo that's good news with regard to cycling through. We've addressed kind of those concerns and how we want to contract with customers going forward and what we're also seeing is some volumes back into what I'll refer to as the securitization market. We see customers kind of ramping up to continue to do business as they always have. And as they look to expand and as they look to basically grow their businesses, both on the insurance side as well as the reinsurance side. They're looking at new avenues, whether it's cyber as an example. How are they going to move their books to new, what I'll refer to, is casualty-type of extreme events.\nSo that's a good, constructive approach for the industry and we're kind of on the cutting edge with a lot of that. So that's a positive. I would say to you that I don't see a lot of dramatic change inside the insurance industry, except for the ones I've highlighted in the past. There is a tremendous amount of technology \u2013 InsureTech that is happening. People are installing new systems. They're transitioning over. They're really looking to do the big data analytics thing. They're really looking to do digital engagement because people expect kind of better online engagement, like they would with an Amazon or when they're buying product on the web. All of that has created a nice opportunity for us to get involved in those \u2013 kind of those projects to redefine how they want to see the future. So, tough time, but good opportunities for us in light of the changes happening.

So naturally, as you layer in subscriptions, that layers into the growth across the rest of the year."]], ["How should we think about the relative commercial impact of the new products you're currently developing or rolling out across the insurance business, as compared to the classic products you developed and rolled out over the last three years? ", ["No. I don't feel that way at all. In fact, I think some of the newer solutions have probably above average potential. And it may \u2013 those of you who have sort of been with us for a while, if we keep saying the same things like remote imagery analytics and Telematics that may sound like there's nothing new there.\nIn data analytic land, particularly in vertical market data analytic land, it takes a while to get to the inflection point. And then you get to the inflection point. And so, that's effectively the dynamic that work inside of our business. So, don't misunderstand us going back to the same themes and as you try to interpret our growth in any particular time period, you may be trying to sort of create sort of a 1:1 equivalence.\nSolutions, when they finally find their mark, actually have an unusual inflection relative to where they began. And so, as you would imagine, day-to-day, minute-to-minute, we're working on this absolutely as hard as we can to get established as well as feeding the pipeline with additional new solutions. I don't \u2013 it's not the case that the newer solutions have lesser potential than those that maybe we developed three to five years ago. I don't know if you want to add to that, Mark.\nMark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nOnly thing I was going to highlight, too, is I think we have a preference. I'd assume our colleague from the phone do that. We would prefer a subscription-type model. So as opposed to kind of going at it from a transactional perspective, we'd like to create longer-term contracts with customers and the revenue rec on that flow (47:57). So that is a way we feel that they'll use us for all of their transactions as opposed to selected ones, if you were to try to price it on a transaction. So maybe a little bit of a patient philosophy, but that's the way we typically worked up the side of the (48:14) solutions into our revenue mix."]], ["But just as we look at technology that's making cars safer and that ultimately will even make cars drive themselves, which will increase safety even more, that could have a very negative impact on auto premiums longer term. ", ["Yes. Let me take that on. I mean clearly, that's on the minds of our personal lines of writers. The insurance industry as a whole, I think has a view that that's going to make for a safer long-term environment for people on the road. It can save a million or more lives per year. And I think there's some views out there, you can kind of do your own research that, now, the personal auto premium could be something that looks at maybe half of what it is today.\nI think those customers are looking to ways to kind of reimagine their business and I think a lot of it has to do with moving into what I'll call small commercial lines, so micro business owners work on the cyber side of things. That very much fits our model. That's very helpful. They want to try to move into what is kind of a personal lines flow, meaning just, do it in an expert way without people involved, and they want to move that concept, which is on the personal lines side, to commercial.\nSo those fit well into what we're trying to help them do that. The other thing I think we should just remember as a whole, a large part of the risk throughout the world is either uninsured or underinsured. And I think that's the biggest opportunity for the industry as a whole. There's a need there and I think the industry needs to find ways to ensure what is a very, very large market opportunity with better analytics and ways to assess that risk. So longer-term, bigger picture, but (56:17).\nScott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nI would just add that one of the things that will always be the case is, almost regardless of the size of the segment, the participants will still need to understand where they stand relative to the overall marketplace and part of what we do is we really help get a handle on what's affecting that whole space and also the relativity \u2013 excuse me, the relativities between the players. That will be an enduring need. So it's not just the scale of the market. It's also the need to pick apart what's going on in the market."]], ["And as a follow-up to that, in terms of the ramp-up that you expect from the new products in insurance, is that also a ramp up that you expect in earnings as well? ", ["Yes. So, there are a couple questions in there. So maybe just to start with, I think your first question is when you say profitability, I presume you're speaking on an EBITDA level. And what I would say is \u2013 I mean, what you see across the company is, we're managing expense growth to both fund the existing solutions as well as new ones and I would say that's the same within insurance. So I don't think you'd see dramatically different trends if you were to sort of parse apart the profitability by vertical because we are investing across all of the verticals. I would also note that in the acquisition front, there are a number of new acquisitions. In the quarter, those were essentially across all the acquisitions breakeven. Those are things that we're clicking into our existing business and we think that those margins will ramp. So you have those two effects within the margin.\nAnd then I think your second question was with regards to new products and the profitability of those as those sort of click in. Generally, similar to the rest of our solutions, the whole idea of build it once, sell it a lot of times. The more you put on the top-line, the greater the profitability expands. Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything additional about any of the specific solutions we're working on there.\nMark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.\nSo I think we were trying to address this a little bit before. I think we are seeing uptake in some of the remote imagery. I think we're seeing some uptake in our customers with telematics. I think we have good growth and opportunities internationally the way we contracted around that will be probably more subscription that it is on the transactional perspective. So as that uptake is more of a second-half story, we would also see that as hopefully helping margins because what happens here is we've already invested in or investing in a solution. So it's just the overall dynamic of the nature of our business. Yes, there is a lot of costs that are there and they'll remain because we're investing and once we start the uptake in revenues, there's not a lot of variable incremental cost sales."]], ["The principal variance in your fourth quarter results versus ours and I think most people's expectations was the higher level of spending in the business P&L and it looks it's on the wireline P&L.

", ["Thank you. Yes. As you saw that we had a strong CapEx coming into the fourth quarter, ultimately, I'm really happy about it. You can see that our pace is coming up here quite dramatically in what we're investing in right now. And the interesting thing is of course that since we launched the Verizon Intelligent Edge Network, we have constantly found a lot of efficiency in our CapEx build and that of course is giving us possibilities to continue to do more and more.\nSo, I think that our technology department have no constraints on what they need to do in 2020. This is what they have plans for in order for us to continue to fortify our 4G network to continue with strong additions in the 5G as well as continue with our fiber build.\nAnd when it comes to the monetization of the fiber build, we're already starting to do that. Of course because many of the fibers right now are going to our cell sites on air because that was a part of it. Then of course it has come a little bit later in monetization for our small and medium businesses and enterprise business, et cetera. But clearly we're already now seeing the benefits of doing that.\nSo, going into 2020, I think we have a very solid capital allocation for our CapEx. Matt and the team have worked with the technology team and we are improving every year how we do this work. And, of course, it's a lot of reallocation inside that 2017 to 2018 and if we go back three years, it's a dramatic change how we spend because of the new design on the network but also the technology evolutions.\nMatt Ellis\nYes. Thanks. So, on the monetization of the fiber, as Hans mentioned, it's a multiuse network. But you're already starting to see the impact and I'll give an example. And I think some of our network folks have mentioned this publicly in the past few months.\nYou go back to the first quarter of last year and the majority of our new cell sites were going up on third-party fiber you get into the fourth quarter of last year in the 60-plus markets that -- where we're adding fiber. It's now -- a significant majority is going up on our own fiber. So, that will have a significant beneficial -- significant benefit on you'd think our expenses going forward.\nAnd then as we continue to go, we'll add other monetization opportunities over the course of the next couple of years.

Of course, as we all know, there might come out the C-band. And we're of course encouraged about the FCC's plan of doing that. We think the C-band is an important spectrum for many reasons. I mean, first of all, it's one of the global spectrums that frequency will be global.\nSo roaming will be done on it, and that's very important for U.S. market to get into that.

Business had a more than 10% increase in phone gross adds. And as you are aware, our -- a lot of our Business customers are still on a subsidy model rather than device payment model, so I think you see the impact of that. But as I said earlier, we had great growth in the quarter in wireless. And overall margins were in line with a year ago. So we are very happy with the balance of that performance between growth and the margins.\nOn the wireline side, obviously, we still have work to do there as you look at wireline. Certainly, we see the continued effect of the revenue declines in legacy products. That's not new. We've had that for a number of quarters, and we expect that's obviously going to continue.\nThe key for us in wireline is to develop products and services that will offset those legacy products and services. And by bringing the Business segment together where we're bringing both wireless and wireline products to our Business customers holistically, this puts us in a better position to really be that partner of choice for our Business customers as we move into a 5G world. So as we develop those product and services, we look forward to seeing what comes from those segments as we go forward.\nHans Vestberg\nAnd I can only add on the wireline side there, the whole transformation we're doing with the new segments is, of course, paving the way for actually thinking about the customer. This customer extremely important for the digital transformation when it comes to private 5G networks, to mobile edge compute in the future. So the customer relationship is very important there.\nAnd secondly, as Matt said, the investment that we're doing in the network right now with mobile edge compute with fiber and all of that, that's of course things that are going to offset that all the time. It's not immediate because we have a secular decline on the product portfolio. It's known, and -- but we constantly work with the front end of it, and I think that putting together what we have done is really, really good. I mean I have, together with Tami and the team, visited, I would say the majority of all the large Fortune 50 companies in this country right now and talking about our offerings and what we can do for them in the future. I think we had a really good a good start there, but it will take some time.\nSo I think this is a very, very important asset that we have, that we need to work on it. That's why we're taking out cost to do it all the time. As I said, it will not be an immediate recovery, and we will -- but I think we have plans for the future to really do this well.

", ["Thank you very much. When it comes to the 5G Home that we launched now with the NR standard, that was an important thing for us because as you remember, we launched in 4 cities with our proprietary software. Now we have it on the global standard software. So that's an important event for us. And the second important event though of these launches, that we are now having the cell set-up. Remember, we had a North Star, how we want to do this so differently. So yes, you are right, we are launching this, and it's a lot of new experience that we're giving to our consumers but also that we are now taking as we have been working since the early launch on the first 4 cities.\nAs you rightfully point out and I said several times as well, that there's coming a next-generation chipset in the second half of 2020. That's really when we think we're going to have a more massive deployment of it. And until then, we are deploying in the millimeter wave with the ultra wideband in so many cities. So when we get that more -- the next-generation CPE, then based on the next-generation chipset, we're going to be in a very good position second half to actually come out much wider. So this is just the next step for us to get all the insights, billing, experience for our consumers, so we can really take a big step when it come to the next-generation chipset.\nWhen it comes to the smartphones, as you rightfully said, we have launched all the iconic 5G phones so far this year. We see an exciting take up on that because many of our customers are taking the phones. And even if you have not launched all cities, they are preparing. So we are paving the way for them because many of these phones are also extremely good 4G phones, and as soon as we come with 5G for that city, they will also have that. So that we see on us Brian Higgins that is leading our device organization has said basically all phones coming out next year will be 5G capable. So we will have a range of phones coming out next year. There's one brand that we don't know, and we haven't talked about them, and again, they need to talk about when they will have a 5G phone. But all others will basically have their phones coming out.\nSo I feel good about it, the performance has gone up dramatically. I mean if I look at the Galaxy coming out, the Samsung Galaxy, which is one of the first phones where in the beginning, we tune up to 500, 600 megabits per second, which we thought was great. That's doing 2 gig right now constantly in the ultra wideband. So we see also a clear improvement on the software tuning between the network and the handsets. And as we deploy more and more, we're just getting better and better and giving a better and better experience for our customers."]], ["Number one, can you talk about the revenue impact of the step-up in the insurance fee on a full year basis and the amount you expect to reinvest in things like promos and marketing and things like Disney+, so we can get a better sense of the net benefit to the company? ", ["I can start with the second question. I'm not sure where you say is slow. The definition what is a small cell is, number one, I mean I'm not sure there is a good definition on that. Of course we deploy a lot of urban cells right now. In my book, that's actually small cell, so I don't think you're referring to us when you talk about less deployment because we are in the midst of our 5G deployment right now, which is very focused on the dense urban places where there's no macros, it's small cells. But it depends on what you define as a small cell. They're everything from micro to medium-sized hybrids to the macros. And -- but in our case, it's not that we're slowing down anything here.\nMatthew Ellis\nYes. So Colby, on the question on the revenue impact of the step-up in our insurance products, Total Mobile Protection, from a geography standpoint, that's in the other revenue line, so that the contribution from that step-up is not in the service revenue line. But as you say, it's -- you saw a good increase in that line in the quarter. We continue to add value to our customers. It's an example of how we think about the Consumer offering holistically, whether that be the core service and having it on the best network; whether it be bringing value like we have this year, first with Apple Music and now with Disney+; and how we bring other services, such as Total Mobile Protection, cloud storage, et cetera, et cetera. So we continue to look for those opportunities to add value for our customers. And as we do that, you see the impact on revenue, and you see the impact on volume. So coming out of the third quarter, very strong volumes, great momentum coming out of the quarter, and we've seen that continued strong momentum here in October as we start the fourth quarter and head into the holiday season.\nSo all of those things that we're doing around the customer proposition are really driving a lot of positive trajectory for the business right now.

We move on them, and we are preparing our structure, our products and our organization for doing that.\nMatthew Ellis\nYes, Mike. On the wireline side, the legacy pricing pressures that you questioned about. I mean obviously, we're seeing the pressure, both from volume and a pricing standpoint. It's not really dissimilar to what we've seen in the past few quarters, but that's going to continue as customers continue to transition to fiber-based services. That's why we have been doing -- rolling out more fiber, as you know in our One Fiber initiative that's going to give us more opportunities to sell into those customers as they move off of legacy products. And our fiber build has continued to gain momentum, increased a little bit in third quarter of over 1,500 route miles a month on average in the quarter.

But I think that, the team has really shown a really good work here in the last couple of quarters since, I would say, we have this new structure.\nI'm confident we have a good momentum in our business. Rolling on the team probably have some more quarters up their sleeves, thinking how they will continue to compete in this market. So we think it's our at least, I have a lot of confidence in the team we\u2019re rolling on and continue to progress on the service revenue growth that we have done so far.\nOn the fiber build, yes that's a very important build for us. And we have been on for that for quite a while right now and the speed in this quarter was 1400 route miles per month in average in the quarter. Remember in the first quarter we talked about 1000, so definitely everywhere coming up.\nRight now the majority of the fiber is going to our own sites to build, if I may say. But over time of course when we roll in later in part of this year next year, we're also going to be able to offer that to our enterprise customers and wholesale et cetera. So that's how we're working right now and we're building it in 60 more and because it is just so essential for the whole Intelligent Edge Network, it's so essential for the whole 5G play that we have to have this fiber. So we have a good speed now. The team has been there on for quite a while, and so it will take a little bit longer before we can offer it to all our customers. But mainly I would say we're right now we're taking to our own sites, which is very important improvement for our efficiency. Matt?\nMatt Ellis\nYeah. So good morning Phil. So on the service revenue, certainly pleased with the results we've seen in the first half of the year, 3.1% in second quarter, driven by over 6% in the business segment. So great momentum in the wireless products and services across both segments as we head into the second half of the year. We like the momentum we have as we jump off into second half and we'll wait and see how the back half of the year plays out in terms of the total service revenue growth. We certainly see a continued path to continue on the service revenue growth we've had for over a year or so now."]], ["Should we think about that as dry powder for spectrum, which you may be look to flex up on CapEx a bit, or are we actually getting closer to a point where share repurchases become a higher and more immediate priority?

Remember what we outlined in February, we're very clear and disciplined where our capital allocation.

We do everything we need and we are on historical levels and we will continue to be very disciplined there.\nSecondly, we want to put our Board in a position to make a dividend that we have been working and ultimately we work with our debt.

And \u2013 so, we're making good progress to get there and that comes from having strong results that drive good cash flow and you see the progress we've been able to make.\nBut just a couple of add-on points to what Hans said. It's a range that we say we want to be instead of long term. That means, we don't want to go past the 1.75 end of that range either. And so get into the range and then be in the range. And then we also don't expect to build up cash on the balance sheet beyond our normal operating level.\nSo as we get into the range we look at the opportunities priority number one, which is to invest in the business and the rest of the items that Hans talk about. We'll then decide the most appropriate use of cash that we may have to drive long-term value for our shareholders."]], ["If we're guiding for the low end of the tax rate for 2019, should we be then thinking that we're steering our earnings per share growth up, or are there other things in the mix that we shouldn't be taking that improvement right to the bottom line?\nAnd then the second question would be, just with respect to the legacy 1.0 reporting for the business segment.

And I think that when it comes to what you called out the wireline business, I mean it was little bit blended, little bit tougher on the enterprise side.

So I think we see a very good possibility to continue to see that with the accelerates, sort of, the decline in enterprise. We have great funnel in the enterprise business as well.\nI remember I mean there's no impact of the reorganization we have done. I mean I would go the opposite. I will say that, hey the changes we have done in the last 12 months compared to what we've done in the last five to 10 years and we delivered these results in all the units, I think it's a really strength of the company that we are doing a transformation from a positional strength and then, which will set us up to be even stronger going forward.\nAnd, of course, Tam and our team are working daily with our customers and as I said also in my previously, I mean the excitement from -- enterprise customers when we come with the full portfolio, so be it fiber or if it's coming with the 4G or 5G solution, mobile edge compute. I think we have a good and compelling story to continue to work on there. So that's how I see the business. Then of course we still have some legacy business declining in the enterprise side which we'll have for a couple of quarters right now. Our work is to see that accelerated all the time. Matt?\nMatt Ellis\nYes. So David, on the ETR, so as I look at that, remind you that on a year-over-year basis the adjusted ETR is actually is up as I mentioned in the prepared remarks and largely that's because of the onetime impacts a year ago from the adoption of the tax reform.\nSo we do see that continuing to be higher year-over-year.

So kind of similar to the first quarter, so good EPS performance year-over-year in both first quarter and second quarter, strong momentum there for us.\nWe jumped off into the second half of the year and so I feel good about where we are so far this year and we'll see how the back end plays out, but certainly a very strong platform to be building from."]], ["I think one of the surprises that came out of the AT&T result was the strength that they showed relative to history in the enterprise business and they talked about price stability, and other things I think Randall said that this was good at outlook as you have for that unit for some time.

And I think that when it comes to what you called out the wireline business, I mean it was little bit blended, little bit tougher on the enterprise side. But on the other hand the governmental business and the small and medium have a good growth for us. So I think we see a very good possibility to continue to see that with the accelerates, sort of, the decline in enterprise. We have great funnel in the enterprise business as well.\nI remember I mean there's no impact of the reorganization we have done. I mean I would go the opposite. I will say that, hey the changes we have done in the last 12 months compared to what we've done in the last five to 10 years and we delivered these results in all the units, I think it's a really strength of the company that we are doing a transformation from a positional strength and then, which will set us up to be even stronger going forward.\nAnd, of course, Tam and our team are working daily with our customers and as I said also in my previously, I mean the excitement from -- enterprise customers when we come with the full portfolio, so be it fiber or if it's coming with the 4G or 5G solution, mobile edge compute. I think we have a good and compelling story to continue to work on there. So that's how I see the business. Then of course we still have some legacy business declining in the enterprise side which we'll have for a couple of quarters right now. Our work is to see that accelerated all the time. Matt?\nMatt Ellis\nYes.

", ["Okay. On the 5G Home, I think -- remember we have the limited sort of 5G Home in four markets right now and we capped both the development on our software as well on how many cities. That's how we did a proprietary solution.\nThe only thing I can say, our win share is really good in those markets. It seems to be good appetite for 5G Home. We have a good performance of it. And then we're going for the second half of this year or this part of the year, we're going to come back with NR sort of 5G Home CP equipment.\nAnd I think that what we're going to do, we need a certain size of market that -- so it makes sense for us. So I think as we said before, I mean this is the 2021 when we're going to have a significant impact on our revenue. So 2020 is going to be an important year for us and of course coming out now in the latter part of this year and starting at the markets all the time will be very important.\nOn the spectrum side, I mean, I think that we always have the headwind that people don't think we have enough spectrum and all of that. I mean what this organization and this engineering team is doing with the spectrum is, I would say is magnificent.\nNow remember sometimes when we talk about spectrum its so much more it is softer how you plan, how you build the network, how you get utilization out of it? And I think that -- that the team has done very good all the time.\nAs I said previously, we have a very compelling position when it comes to millimeter wave for ultra wideband, but we also have spectrum where we can deploy 5G in the other bands ultimately 5G is going to be on all bands. And I have a high confidence that my team is going to be doing that well continue to have the leadership in the market when it comes to network performance. There might also come up opportunities all the time where it could be added spectrum. But right now to launch both capacity and coverage, we feel confident on the assets we have."]], ["And how do you see your role continuing to evolve as a wholesaler of capacity in the industry?\nAnd then secondly is there an update on any of the potential strategic moves you could make on the wireline side, whether it's asset optimization or trying to figure out maybe how to proceed in the video business with the current size that you have? ", ["Okay. Thank you. On the MVNO side, no, there are no major differences but the important is that, we believe its good model. Remember we outlined our network-to-service strategy where we -- sometimes we're doing the connectivity and then we have others being on top of this in MVNO, sometimes we do the connectivity to platforms and in some cases we do the whole strategy.\nSo I think that that continues to be important for us and we're happy with our partnership with the cable MVNO which is part of how we are actually doing a month usage of our assets, getting maximum utilization of the investments we're doing. So for us this is playing straight into the long-term goals as we have as a company.\nOn the wireline optimization, we -- I would say that the biggest assets we have here is of course all the infrastructure we have, but also the customer relations we have and we are working. Of course we are looking into all the areas we need to fortify or all the areas we should drop which was the market is not demanding. And I think that's a very normal way of reviewing the strategy all the time.\nAnd Tammy and the team is now in place for this quarter, they are confident talking to the customer what we need to do and where we need to fortify in some areas where the products maybe around heating. But is no major, it is just the daily grinding that you do in order to optimize, how you work with your customers and how you optimize your capital and efficiency.\nAnd I can also add of course that, in this quarter we announced and that we're going to work with YouTube TV when it comes to the sort of the linear TV both for the Fios optionality as well as for the wireless customers. So again, working with the model that we outlined in February and just continue with that."]], ["I understand that the longer term spectrum position for 5G, you have a lot of spectrum bands outside of millimeter wave.\nBut there's been a lot of concern in the market of late that for the near term your coverage map may be more limited than your competitors, until you can start peeling away some of your LTE and 3G committed spectrum bands and dedicate them.\nCan you just talk about that issue? ", ["No, that's a great question. I think first of all DSS which is Dynamic Spectrum Sharing is the same for all and that's a standard solution coming out in the market software. So I think that we're not disadvantage -- anyone if you want to deploy your coverage and I think that's how we are on.\nAt the same time you also want to see that there's enough handsets things out in the market when you start turning on 5G, so you get because we want to do a transformative feeling of over 5Gs. We don't want to rebrand them and say it's 5G and you don't feel a difference. We already have the best 4G network and for us the customer is the most important.\nSo you're right. I mean I see that we will have a coverage map whenever it's going to be needed for our customers and is going to be enough handsets in the market and not disadvantage for anything. So I think that historically we have had those feedbacks that we are not in the right position with spectrum etcetera.\nI come from the outside. I worked and saying what Verizon has done with spectrum and with new software\u2019s and with the optimizing, how you build the networks and I'm confident that we have a good path here. I'm not feeling that we're disadvantaged. I feel that we're executing right now, we're launching markets where others are doing other things."]], ["And then secondly if you're able to just quantify the savings you could expect from that as we go into the third quarter?\nAnd then my second question has to do with the fiber out miles you're referencing on the call.

I have the network guys that need this for 4G and 5G, I have the enterprise, I have the small and medium, and I have wholesale. And that's, of course, very important when we build that we can have owner economics on fiber and we can build it as we had all those customers.\nBut, of course, initially quite a lot of the fiber is coming and going to the small cells and that's why we are able to turn up the 2019, as we have done so far. But again, the question earlier was about how much we are now actually gaining on it.\nI think this is an early indicator about how we're building the network, because you need to start with the fiber and getting the permits in the cities before you can deploy the 5G. So this is early indications that we have a high speed and organization to be prepared for the 5G. And whatever our use cases we have for fiber. Matt?\nMatt Ellis\nYeah. So, Colby, on the voluntary separation, yeah, obviously, the income statement charges we took in the fourth quarter of last year from a cash flow standpoint, we took but the largest piece was in the first quarter and then some in 2Q and 3Q. Certainly I think that there's good savings in the first half of the year. We mentioned like $418 million of positive impact in the first half of the year and we'll have another step-up in 3Q as the final tranche of employees came off payroll at the end of June.\nSo for the full year, I expect that to be north of $1 billion of impact and that benefit on a year-over-year basis will carry over into the first half of next year until we get to a full run rate by June of next year.

But let me just say, I mean if I look in the second quarter it was a little bit more competitive than the first quarter when it comes to competition in the market and that tells a lot about our performance that we gained all those net additions at the same time we had the low churn.\nAnd so I think that on the business side, as I said before, we are -- we're doing well on the business side and again I think that the wireless part of the business side is important than the network performance ease of critical essence, the coverage and the performance. But, of course, there's competition for those deals as well. I think we're doing well in that area and we will continue to do well.\nWe have new offerings coming out and we'll continue to build the network even more robust and getting more quality on it. So again I think the team is there, Matt and I are working with transformation of the company to enable after continue to compete and do well in the market and even both Tami, I would say and Ronan are the sort of tools to work in the market. And that's what we're doing. And I think we're done it well in this quarter and preparing for the rest of the year.\nMatt Ellis\nJust one follow-up on the video question there. Look we're very confident with \u2013 the most important thing to customers and wireless is the quality of the network experience. And so for the past couple of years now, we're seeing competitors bundled video offerings in with wireless and we continue to lead the industry in phone gross adds and we continue to lead the industry in churn. So I think that demonstrates the most important thing to customer is the quality of that connection, the reliability of that connection and that when you have the best network, you don't need to bundle other things in there in the same way and we'll continue to be focused on providing the best quality network out there."]], ["And so, it was actually interesting to see that the first mobile offer was actually priced a little bit higher than your 4G offering and so that implies it's a little bit more of an ARPU driver.\nSo the first question is, as we sort of watch more 5G deployments going forward, what's success factor do you think investor should be focusing on?

We - you shouldn't expect to see them through the rest of the year.\nAnd so, you got strength in the overall results of the business in the Wireless and Wireline segments being offset by those - those one-timers that I'll say add up to about $0.02 of EPS pressure that's sitting in C&O. So it's related to one-timers rather than Verizon Media Group is driving that number in C&O."]], ["I wonder if you could just comment on that - what you've learned about high frequency spectrum, the work that we did on the Sacramento market and then some of the - the press reports of your roll out of mobility in Chicago, in particular and then - and what some of the comments are - were yesterday from T-Mobile's, Neville Ray all sort of point at - at millimeter wave having real challenges for propagation.\nI'm wondering how you think about millimeter wave in the context of your broader roll out at this point of 5G particularly for mobility?

And again, we're very early on in - in improving the software, how we can deal with it.\nWe will need to remind ourselves, this is not the coverage spectrum because we will do it as far as the economic is sustainable, of course. But still, it's - it's very good ranges we can come up with and of course, the throughput and speeds are enormous.\nAnd again, we're very early on - on the - on the journey. I think that no one else in the whole industry knows more than Verizon about it. We're being onto these for two years and what we have seen on it, he said, it's a - it's a good strategy.\nAnd topping that, which I've said before the dynamics sort of spectrum sharing will be the next step for us to see that we have all the assets to deploy our strategy on 5G to meet the different type of use cases, we outlined at the Investor Day sort of the mobility case, the 5G home case and the mobile edge compute case. So that's what we're working with everyday here to improve et cetera. So the engineering team feels good about it."]], ["First, if you look at the 5G roll out for the home, I think initially your advertising to offer over several hundred megabits per second of speed to the consumer and more recently, we've learned that you've been trailing in over 100 megabit product.\nAnd I'm curious how that change in throughput affects the potential coverage in homes over time or the speed that you might be able to reach that initial 30 million home targeted that would accelerate that the pace of the roll out?\nAnd then just following up on the comments around the partnership with YouTube TV, what are your thoughts on potentially exiting the Fios video business and letting someone like a YouTube TV or another partner, just potentially manage that video business for you, so you could just really focus on the broadband and the infrastructure side of the equation? ", ["Thanks. Okay. Rightfully mentioned, we started with the 300 megabits per second in our - in our offering in the cities. Of course, we have said that we will sort of meet all the customer demands and that's why we are of course, are trailing out different type of speeds as well. And as you rightfully said, I mean, if you have a lower speed and throughput of course, the range of coverage will go out and go further.\nBut again, we need to meet the customer demands in the markets, we're going to and - and the team with Ronan Dunne will see that we are competitive in every marketplace we go.\nBut of course, you can see possibilities, we'll have different ranges of speeds on 5G home as well, but we're not there yet. We will come in the second half of the - this year and see what offerings going to have.\nOn the YouTube TV, I think that what most important is that we are committed to support our customers with the optionality. Here we are creating, as we said from the beginning when we decided not to pursue our own investment in OTT that we will have partners in order to work out our strategy, networking [ph] strategy and give our customers optionality and that goes also for our Fios customers, and their You Tube TV will play a - play a role for us.\nBrady Connor\nThanks Mike.

We saw fair amount of competitive activity in the first quarter, and we really didn't participate in that until we got into the March time period when we start to see volumes pick up.\nWe feel good about the momentum we have in the business, as we exited the first quarter, as we come into second quarter and expect to see that drive performance for the rest of the year.\nOn the YouTube TV, I think is as you described and you heard Hans gives us the opportunity to combine that product with the core wireless offering and Ron and his team will - will make sure that's relevant to our wireless mobility customers having that additional functionality available to them."]], ["Just curious how much of that you're anticipating coming from the operational businesses, so say differently, you're showing up in the EBITDA line item versus improvements that you're expecting below the line such as interest expense, taxes or other income I saw, for example, other income was $295 million or about $0.06 benefit in the first quarter at least that we weren't anticipating in our model.\nAnd then secondly, as it relates to the savings from the VSP program, you mentioned the $180 million to date and you mentioned $180 million to-date, and you've - I'm just curious, how much of that or how much more can we expect for the remainder of the year. ", ["Yeah. Thanks, Colby. So I'll start with your second question. So as you think about the VSP savings in the first quarter, we said approximately 10,000 V Teamers, who are leaving the organization, as a whole around half of those came off at the end of December. So you had a full quarter impact from those.\nThe second tranche was at the end of - end of March. So really minimal impact from those. So as you think, when you get to a full run rate, it's going to be significantly higher than that $180 million.\n2Q will be a blend. It will be more than the 5,000, but not the full 10,000. It really be 3Q when you get to a full run rate benefit compared to the $180 million that we saw in 1Q.\nAnd as you say, more than approximately 60% of that benefit came from the - in the Wireline segment. And so we expect to see that continue to help wireline margins for the year, as a whole. So we think that - that will be something that will be a positive, as you think about managing the - the cost in that business to offset some of the trends on the revenue line.\nIn terms of the EPS guidance, so I want to just make sure that we level set, where were - where we were. We wanted to make sure we kept it in the same basis as last time. Last time, we said that the adjusted EPS before the impact of the leasing standard would be similar to last year, last year is $4.71. And so we said adjusting the guidance to be low-single digits up.\nAnd to be clear, even after accounting for the new leasing standard that would put us in the - in the mid-$4.70s from an adjusted EPS standpoint.\nAnd when you think about what's in there, you got the headwind from the - the lease accounting standard, you've also got the impact of the commission expense deferral under the revenue recognition, and our expectation of those impacts are the same, as we outlined previously.\nSo well, we certainly think and Brady took you through this in the prepared remarks, when you look to the first quarter results, we're up $0.03 year-over-year all in, from an adjusted EPS standpoint, that included $0.04 of pressure from the accounting. And in addition to that the ETR year-over-year was up about 100 basis points.\nSo that year-over-year increase in the underlying earnings of the business was strong. And you touched on one piece that's certainly the benefit of the Voluntary Separation Program was helpful in there.\nBut when you look at the Wireless business and you see the 4.4% service revenue growth, and you see the - EBITDA margin, when you adjust for the impact of the accounting for 48%, we feel very strong about the operational performance of the business on a good growth, on a year-over-year basis, and we have good momentum coming out of the first quarter, and as we head into the rest of the year. So that was the - the reason for the - the change in guidance."]], ["And then maybe if you can try to bifurcate between the competitive landscape versus technology migration?\nAnd then, I guess I'll beat the YouTube TV one more time, just sort of thinking about and maybe this is for Hans.

", ["Thanks, John. So, on the wireless service revenue, I think, as you look at the fourth quarter number, what we have is, we continue to have good underlying momentum in the wireless service revenue, whether you're talking about the social service revenue line, or whether you're looking at the ARPU line. But, there is little bit of noise in the fourth quarter number that masks that growth. So, let me just give you a little more detail.\nIn 4Q, both in \u201817 and \u201818, we had some nonrecurring items that gives us that 1.9% year-over-year increase, which as you say, slightly lower than the past two quarters but still certainly a good positive number. 4Q in \u201817, we had a positive adjustment related to our wholesale revenues, and that adjustment didn't repeat this year. So, we're lapping that adjustment. Additionally, this year, we had a couple of items go the other direction, including some service credits related to that we granted customers impacted by natural disasters. So, when you compare those, you remove those, the underlying core retail postpaid service revenue increased sequentially, had good momentum year-over-year, in line with what we saw in 2Q and 3Q. And importantly we start 2019 billing more accounts and at a higher ARPA than we started last year. So, it's a good place to be. I think, we continue to see opportunity to increase service revenue in 2019 by adding accounts as we did last year, but also increasing ARPA. There is still significant headroom for us to move customer to unlimited and step them up when they're in unlimited, adding more devices to accounts. So, I think the momentum we saw in \u201818 will certainly continue into \u201819 in a good way.\nOn the free cash flow, so, we don't actually provide, as you know, a free cash flow guide for the year. We did talk about the fact cash taxes will be higher. As I think about cash flow for 2019, there's five major items I would think about, a couple of them in the positive direction. We certainly expect the core EBITDA of the business to increase year-over-year. Additionally, last year, we had $1.7 billion of pension and benefits contribution, so we would not expect to be at the same level in 2019. And the other direction I mentioned in the prepared comments, the higher cash taxes, will also have the payments related to the voluntary severance program; all of those cash outflow will be in 2019. And we do expect CapEx to be higher part slightly year-over-year too. So, when you net those items together, you can kind of get to a view for 2019 cash flow. But certainly cash flow in 2018, very strong, $34 billion, up $10 billion year-over-year. We're proud of the progress we made there and will certainly look to build on that in 2019."]], ["You are focusing on the wireline side, Matt, kind of pros and cons we saw, little bit of an uptick in enterprise; we saw a big step down in wholesale; and margins really kind of came off in that division.

So, we will continue with that. And then, as you rightly say, as you think about the margins, as you head into \u201819, wireline will see a good part of the benefit from the voluntary severance program. So, that in addition to the other ongoing cost actions that we continue to take, should be of assistance to the wireline margins in \u201819.\nHans Vestberg\nYes. And if we look at the whole wireline team, as you rightfully pointed out, we have a secular decline in certain areas there. But to be honest, we also see with the assets we're now bringing out with intelligence edge network, we see possibility for many new solutions, sort of coming out of our customers based on the fiber we're deploying, but also when it comes to SD WAN and a couple of other very important solutions that are bringing out. At the same time, the small and medium business segment is very important for the U.S. economy where we are well-positioned. The wholesale has of course come down a little bit. But remember, now, we are deploying more infrastructure than ever before. So, I think that over time, but it will take some time, we'll definitely see even more possibility there. We have a very focus on that team to actually break the trend. We have now been coming down for -- when it comes to growth, I think the team is really focused on getting new products out. And we have a really good customer base to hold the wireline business. And as we move into the second quarter and our customer centric organization, it will even be more important with these customers that we can orchestrate with all our product portfolio from wireline, wireless, the IoT business et cetera. So I think we're really focused on coming back to growth. At the same time, you see that we're taking out costs. So, we see that we're managing that. So, again, we have a surgical focus on actually top-line, but at the same time seeing that we are managing our cost basis at the same time. And I think that Matt and the team are on to that operation all the time and we will continue so in 2019.\nMatt Ellis\nYes. On the lease accounting, David. So, couple of different things. On the income statement, as you heard upfront, we expect $0.01 to $0.02 of headwind per quarter. That's going to come mostly above the line. There may be some initial adjustments that will hit below the line but mostly above the line. If you think about it, there are some costs upfront costs associated with leases that we historically would've capitalized under the old rules that we won't necessarily be able to capitalize all those rules -- all of those upfront costs under the new rules. So, that's where you'll see some of the change come through. From a balance sheet standpoint, we will be grossing up both the asset and liability side of the balance sheet. At this point, we expect in the $21 billion to $23 billion range. So, that's the impact, you should see come through in the first quarter of 2019 from adopting that new standard."]], ["It seems like you've been hitting on some of the same themes for a while now, and that it may be right for sort of reimagining what you do with that business. ", ["So, as you say, a number of the trends we've seen in wireline have been ongoing for a number of years, including the increasing content costs. So, we continue to look for creating different options for customers that make sense for the price points you can then put in front of customers. And so -- but we don't expect the trajectory of content costs to change significantly over the next few years, unless we take some actions. And if we have the opportunity to provide customers with different ways of getting to the video content they want, we will certainly be excited about doing that. So, ever since we did choice TV, about four years ago now, we've been looking ways to get customers better choice around the cost of getting their video product, and we\u2019ll continue to do that.\nHans Vestberg\nAnd I agree with Matt here. We will of course over time see that we can create optionality for our customers to choose between different solutions for their TV viewing. So, we will have that definitely in our pocket. Initially, of course 5G Home has been focused on other cities than our footprint for Fios. But ultimately, we need to see that our customers have all the choices when it comes to how they want to consume the video. We see the trends in the market. And as Matt said, we're working hard with our cost in Fios all the way from content to other cost elements and see that we're managing that well. But ultimately, we need to create optionality for our customers. That's what Verizon always has done and that we\u2019ll continue to do."]], ["And then secondly on a wireless competitive landscape, can you just talk about what you saw in the marketplace in 4Q, and whether anything is really changed materially thus far in January? ", ["Yes. Hey, Matt. So, on your first question, no major impact at this point on the macro economy or even the shutdown. On the shutdown, we did see some impact in our government business, as you'd expect, but nothing significant to the overall business. And then, in the wireless market, we see a continuation of the trends that we saw in 2018. The vast majority of promotions now are more on the handset side, the hardware as opposed on the service revenue. We continue to see that promotional activity in the marketplace, but we continue to believe that -- and see the evidence with the great network experience and having the right offers where we compete effectively. And I would reiterate what we said earlier, when you talk about that best network experience, when you look at a number of the third-party surveys that came out for the second half of 2018 performance, not only did our performance improve but we widened the lead against the competition. So, that continues to matter to our customers and puts us in a position to compete effectively in the marketplace."]], ["I just want to come back to CapEx and the lower outlook there, it sounds like you are certainly enjoying some efficiencies as a result of your cost savings program.\nI am wondering if there are any timing considerations.

And we've seen performance as we've expected since we started doing those installs.\nThe technology works, our customers are getting the experience they expected and we are getting a lot of good learning which will benefit us next year when we roll-out the product to that much larger audience. 5G Home will become more significant as we expand coverage and we get on the global standards equipment in 2019.\nAnd I would expect that that would start to have an impact on consolidated revenues as we get into 2020 and beyond. And you mentioned self-installs.

We are focused on our offerings and we will continue to do so.\nIn terms of the upgrade rate decline, and while there has certainly been some benefit there, I would say the bigger benefit to cash flow has come from just the operational performance of the business. Certainly the lower upgrade rate has helped. I don't see that changing anytime soon.\nCertainly as we get into the fourth quarter, we would expect to see seasonal uptick in the upgrade rate. But whether it will be at the same levels we saw in the last couple of years or whether we will see a slight year-over-year decline, it's too soon in the season to tell.\nObviously, we are not one month into the fourth quarter and the heavy part of the fourth quarter activity is still ahead of us.

And whether that be - you mentioned the Apple devices.\nAnd also the Google Pixel is a great device, a new device out there, and we are seeing very strong demand for that as well.

But I don't see a major change from the trends we've seen over the past couple of years."]], ["And then just go back to the question on Oath, are there monetization opportunities you would evaluate with Oath given the relative scale relative to some of the larger players in that space? ", ["Thanks, Matt. So, on Oath the team is focused on the right things. As I mentioned, they are driving demand in mobile and video offerings. And as I said, we have some great assets and talented people in there at this point. The business growth is not yet consistent with the quality of the assets of the people, but they are working hard and we believe they are going to get there. And that's what we are focused on, is supporting that team and the efforts they have.\nI would also point out the value that it's harder for people to see that came with the Oath business around some of the very strong technical skills, whether that'd be in data analytics, artificial intelligence, VR. And really taking those skills and deploying them across the totality of the Verizon business is providing significant value, too.\nOn the Enterprise side, I would say no major change in the competitive intensity. We're certainly seeing businesses looking to do more, and change the connectivity profiles of their businesses, but we also are seeing pricing pressure in there as well. So what's going to determine our success there is if we continue to develop the products enterprises are looking for, not just for today, but for tomorrow.\nAnd as we continue to do that, that will be the determinant of our success in that space. The team is very focused on doing that. They've had a number of good wins this year. And if we keep on that trajectory, I think we have a chance to like where we will end up."]], ["So Lowe, during your tenure as CEO you've really -- Verizon has really stuck to it's core competency of wireless network leadership while other companies have moved to diversify into adjacent areas. ", ["I think your strategy is based on the assets that you have in your portfolio and where you think you can go with a high degree of success. We talk about competing to win, we don't want to play to play, we want to play to win. We've looked at the things that we've done, network leadership is at the core, it's part of the values of the company, every individual here is proud of what we do on network leadership; and we've stayed close to that core, branching out though into things like Verizon Connect and Oath is a very logical near progression for us, and we see the advantages that will strengthen the core going forward. If I look at the things I'm proudest of, it's the things that you mentioned that we've done and pushing the envelope on 5G and 4G are some of those.\nI also love to say a little bit with a smile on my face, I'm glad we didn't follow a lot of the things the analysts and the bankers told us we had to do and that's put us in a position now that Matt outlined where we've got a strong balance sheet, we've got a clear strategy, and I think we are going to put a significant distance between us and the competition; and the first mover on the network generation changes usually gains a significant amount of market share, and with the assets that we have we think we're in that position with 5G."]], ["And then on the mobility side, you're starting to talk about that a bit more, we've heard some of your competitors talk about how many markets to launch this year; how rapidly do you think you're going to roll that out? ", ["So when it comes to the fixed wireless access, so as I said in the beginning, we will have an initial commercial launch of four markets this year, that's going to be based on our sort of software that we developed in the beginning calling TS [ph]. We are preparing the whole network with Intelligent Edge Network to be ready to launch 5G based on the and/or [ph] standard that is coming out right now; and vendors -- and again, equipment manufacturers and OEMs are preparing right now. So we will be ready as soon as that has the majority to be released to our customers; so that they will come back when we'll go for the full 30 million households which is our own ambitions that we have explained before. So that's where we are on the fixed wireless access.\nOn the mobility, we do the same. Remember the Intelligent Edge Network is a multi-use network, so it's a same rate base station that is going to provide our fixed wireless access as mobility. So we are and as I said before, I mean we are now in deployment on fiber in more than 50 cities. So we are preparing everything to be ready for the majority of the equipment and the software's as well as having the CPE and handset market ready for launching those products, and right now that's the ambitions we see in 2019, we have not named the cities but as you can here we are deploying in 50 markets with fiber sales [ph], and I think that's an important point of it. So that's where we are and we will come back and give you updates all the time on the new things we're doing and today we're now launching the third city here in Houston, we're super excited over that; so we'll continue to flow all the information on what we're doing on 5G."]], ["Hans, can you talk us through what's happening on the CapEx side to move towards the lower end of the guide; are you doing less this year than you expected or just getting more for it? ", ["I think this is a great question; remember when I came in -- we decided together with Matt, Lowell and the whole management team to actually flip the whole network to the -- sort of the horizontal Intelligent Edge Network. And I also experienced there were two important factors where we did that; one, we wanted to deliver new type of services based on a horizontal network, especially the ones coming from 5G and we want to see some of them coming up very shortly. The second was that we also could be so much more efficient with new technologies in multipurpose equipment. At the same time we put in the new process for capital efficiency that Matt and I are sharing, and I think that's what you're seeing right now; we are actually doing much more than before when it comes to deployment. Then as we say here, we are already deploying 5G things at the moment, we're preparing all the network for it, so that's embedded in the numbers that you see.\nAt the same time we also are making a big shift in our whole spending; I mean if I look what we spend in 2017 in the capital result CapEx than in 2018 it's very different; so we're also making shift at all time but this is nothing that we're limiting, we used our more efficient of using our capital and my engineering team are very happy with the investment that we're doing at the moment. So I think that we are also -- as you said, we are moving over to much more small cells than making bigger towers and macro cells. And I will say, if you go back a couple of years ago our -- majority of all our investment was on macro towers and today the majority is on densification with smaller cells. So we have shifted dramatically over the years and I've only been part of it now for more than one year but I've seen how the engineering team is responding to the new way of working and setting up the whole new network structure. So that's what you seen in the figures."]], ["Matt, could I just ask some questions on the finance side, just on the lower tax guide -- could you talk about the reasons why that is and is that flowing through to the cash flow side of the equation, and do we need to address that in the free cash flow number as well? ", ["I'll start with the tax question. So, as you look at the first half of the year the ETR [ph] was impacted certainly by tax reform but we had a couple of one-timers in there, especially related to the pension contribution we did in first quarter that you wouldn't see necessarily flow through to the second half of the year, so that's why we're guiding towards the lower end of the 24% to 26% range for the year as a whole. In terms of it flowing through to the cash flow; you know, I would say certainly you should expect cash taxes to be positively impacted this year by tax reform. We didn't have that in the first quarter because we had no scheduled payments; as you know, second quarter we had the first of two scheduled payments for the year and so started to see those flow through, expect to see lower tax rate flow through to our cash tax payments in the rest of the year and that's certainly behind the commentary that we gave around the ability to strengthen the balance sheet this year.\nSo expect to continue to see the benefit from the lower tax rate.

So when we decided to attempt to get a contract literally a year ahead of expiration -- that was a major change in our relationship, and I would like to thank the union leadership for the way -- the approach that they took during this. As far as your financial projections; I would say just continue with the projections that you've seen, we do have increases and contributions and that sort of thing but it's not a significant change to the bottom-line trajectory that you've seen the way it was after our last contract.

That guidance of 170 to 178 [ph] is the same range of actual spending we've had over the past four years. So what investors should have grown accustomed to seeing for Verizon is consistent total capital spend on a disciplined methodical manner. But the items within that spend evolve over time as the technologies evolve.\nSo this year we've already started spend on 5G. The spend on those three to five initial launch city's began earlier this year, so that's ongoing. You should expect to see spend in additional cities be underway by the end of the year, so that we're in a position to launch additional geographies in 2019.\nBut that's within our current CapEx guidance. And as we look forward, we continue to believe that we can deploy the network within the typical range. If we see an opportunity to accelerate because of the market, we're not afraid to do so, but it will be based off of the opportunity we have in the marketplace.\nBut this really comes back to the design of the network over the past few years, by identifying the 4G network we've put a lot of the infrastructure in place that we need to deploy 5G, especially using millimeter wave spectrum.\nSo we don't see this as being a massive uptick. This is not the same thing as when we adopted 4G and went from a CDMA based 3G network to the 4G LTE network. This is a very different network rollout. And I think you will see that in the CapEx as we go forward.\nSo look, as you mentioned the different revenue buckets. We're very comfortable that certainly the mobility bucket gives us the opportunity to deepen our relationship with our existing customer base and look to grow that base.\nResidential broadband is an existing market that we have opportunity to grow share in.

Wireline, I think in 2018 will be on a similar trajectory that you've seen in the past couple of years. Although as we continue to deploy more fiber in the network, it gives us opportunities to replace some of those earnings that were on copper based products with fiber based products which should be more sustainable going forward.\nSo, net you should certainly see an improvement in the earnings profile of the company versus the last couple of years.

We saw that numerous times throughout the year and we see that in the performance we had on net ads whether it be the new activations coming in or the churn that we'd had.\nSo, each of the last three quarters of the year, phone churn was below 0.8% and I think that tells you how much customers enjoy being on the Verizon network. So, you ask about the game of source. Look, we're happy of what we've seen so far. Obviously, Comcast is on and Charter has said they expect to be on later this year.\nAnd as we say consistently we like those agreements and we signed them in 2011 and we're happy to be doing them today. And we'll see how they play out but everything we've seen so far is in line with our expectations and we're glad to have that traffic on that network and monetize in that traffic based on what those companies are doing with those agreements.\nAnd in terms of what the competitors are doing. Look, they bundle a number of things into their services during the course of last year and our numbers have staid very consistent. So, at the end of the day, the quality of the network that the device is on is of fundamental importance. And overall, when you look at our value proposition, it continues to resonate strongly.\nAnd let's say we're very happy with the results we had last year and starting off 2018 on the [front foot].\nLowell McAdam\nOkay Mike, let me take where we want to have from infrastructure in a vision perspective. Look, I think it's very clear here whether you look at what's going on today with customers or what you're anticipating that you saw at CES and others from what's next that there is an insatiable demand for broadband.\nAnd it's not mobile and it's not fixed. It, customers don\u2019t care and I think who wins is going to be able to provide them the service that they can move seamlessly from fixed to mobile. We have been a much stronger mobile company over the years but the way we're positioning our fiber deployment and the way we're positioning 5G, we will be able to disregard geography and deploy those broadband services at a much lower cost than we've ever seen at least during my career.\nNow for us to complete the vision, you need to be able to provide sort of those internet information services and video drives an awful lot of that. And we talked at length about taking the Oath assets to be that information source around news boards, finance and entertainment and lifestyle. And we think that the assets that we have will provide what customers need.\nSo, and you look at the applications going forward, they will whether it's medical and healthcare services, whether it's smart cities, whether it's education, whether it's autonomous cars and transportation systems, you're going to need that sort of seamless high bandwidth. And we lump that under the title human ability.\nSo, our focus is around giving all of our customers the capabilities to embrace these applications, so the future that are going to make their lives so much better. And so our investments they are all about providing the assets in the platforms to deliver that."]], ["I was wondering how should we think about the areas where you believe the biggest opportunities for cost reductions are and how should we think about those cost cuts filtering in through the company over the next couple of years?\nAnd then secondly, I was wondering if going back to the 5G topic, if you can touch upon whether you believe that fiber will be a competitive advantage in this world. ", ["Thanks, Amir. Let me take the first one on the $10 billion number over the next four years that Lowell mentioned in September and we have talked about little since then. Look, what every area of the business is where we're looking and we believe that there is opportunities across every area of the business. Obviously network; cost are significant part, distribution; is something we're taking a close look at customer care or the back office type activities.\nEssentially there is no area of the business it isn't going to get examined as part of this exercise because this imperative we make sure that we're as efficient a company as we can be as we go forward. From a timing standpoint, I can tell you we've embedded the 2018 targets for this activity in each of the business units operating plans for the year. And I look forward to discussing the results that we achieved on this as we go forward in '18 and into the future.\nLowell McAdam\nAnd then Amir, I guess my answer on the fiber competitive advantage is, throughout my career I have always believed and it's been reinforced many times that if you've got a critical component of your success, you better own it and control it. And that fits with our direct distribution, it fits with a lot of our customer service. We don't outsource sales. We certainly wouldn't outsource critical components of our network.\nAs Hans has come in and put in our architecture for Intelligent Edge, owning that fiber asset is important to our financial performance as well as the performance of the network. And as we've seen time-and-time again, network competitive advantage drives customers which ultimately drives financial. So, you won't see us outsource much in the way of network unless someone has a huge scale advantage and we could negotiate very strong performance and very consistent financials that would go along with it."]], ["As you guys look after the fourth quarter do you think that changes and maybe bounces back a little bit, like maybe won\u2019t see as much seasonality you typically do, we are basically trying to get a sense whether it\u2019s sort of a lack change in the technology or just customer at this point waiting for their turn to come out?\nAnd then related to Simon\u2019s questions, you saw sequential growth in service revenue for the first time in a while this quarter and it sounds like these trends are sort of inflecting. ", ["Yes, thanks John. So as you mentioned the upgrade rate in the third quarter was a little lower than we have seen in past years. I think what you are seeing there is difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we have historically seen. Obviously Apple is part of that with splitting the new devices between the eight, which came out in 3Q and the ten which comes out in 4Q.\nBut also on the Android OS side of the house with having the new Google device coming out this month as well. I think you are going to see more of \u2013 we would expect to see a shift is some of the volumes versus typically from 3Q to 4Q. So look as we get into the holiday season some of those new devices come out, we think, we will see strong demand and look if you are paying a $1000 for a new handset you are going to walk not to be on a good network. So we are very confident that we will get more than our fair share of that activity when it comes through in the fourth quarter, but obviously, we will wait to see exactly how that plays out.\nIn terms of the sequential revenue trends and as you highlighted, we were up in service revenue from 2Q to 3Q. That was in-line with our expectations as we discussed on the last call. As you start to see combination a number of factors. We have largely migrated the consumer base to unsubsidized pricing, it was 78% in 3Q, 75% in 2Q. So that transition is largely done and so you are no longer seeing as much of a headwind from the reduction in the line access fee. And as I mentioned, we are starting to see step up and migrate is over.\nIn addition to that, we increased the number of accounts for the second quarter in a row, so you got the total volume in the business up as the rate we are getting from customers going up too. So as I said in the script, we expect to be inside of 4% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, and as I have said previously, I expect that we will get to service revenue growth during 2018.\nIn terms of your questions around margins, it's a little too soon to say where they will play out in the fourth quarter. Obviously as we are now on unsubsidized, we don't have the same subsidy headwind, but we will see what the environment is like in the fourth quarter competitively and we will respond as necessary. So we will see where that shakes out between now and the end of the year."]], ["So for example, to what extend do you think that this is a structural improvement in churn as a result of customers moving into Unlimited plans and other plans where they can control their overage.

As you look at the 4G network only approximately 50% just over 50% of our spectrum portfolio server in that network today. We have got additional spectrum assets that will serve that network in 2018 whether that the [Refarm] (Ph) and 850 and PCS or whether it would be put in the AWS-3 to work.\nAnd additionally as you move into the 5G world, we look forward to closing the straight path transactions and the XO spectrum transaction as head into 2018. So we are comfortable with our spectrum positions. As we think about future auctions we will wait to see what is in there or make assessments at that time. but very comfortable with the portfolio we have today.\nAnd as obviously as we think about added capacity to the network we have more than spectrum as the tools available to us as we go forward, and we have talked about the different technology and architecture tools with LTE Advance and all the different pieces in there. We continue to be able to add capacity as we move to more software defined networking and those type of tools and in obviously densification.\nAnd that densification based of having more fiber available in the network. So to get to your first question, we continue to deploy fiber and we will continue to do that as we head into 2018 as you say I'm not going to talk to 2018 CapEx at this time, but you should expect to see us continue to be deploying fiber around the country as we go forward to service both wireless but also customers across the rest of our businesses and getting into IoT applications as well.\nMichael Stefanski\nJennifer thank you and Eunice next question please?"]], ["I\u2019m just trying to unpack the commentary a touch, whether it\u2019s a shift in some of the spending priorities that\u2019s taking place that\u2019s enabling you to get to the lower end?

That\u2019s still going to be around 17 billion of spend, so certainly not in significant number. Some of this is just a timing of the activity with the network teams between 2017 and 2018l. But look, I would tell you that the key thing here and you talk about has there been any shift in priorities and I would say absolutely not.\nThe priority to continue to invest in the network whether that\u2019s adding capacity for the networks today or pre-positioning the network and being at the leading edge of building the future network technologies, that priority is unchanged and as we had into 2018, you will see that we will continue to spend to continue to do exactly those things.

It\u2019s exact as we expected. In terms of the timing of mobile 5G, it\u2019s certainly not a 2018 activity.\nBut you talk about does it change our view on the types of services we will be able to offer, absolutely not. We have seen a wide range of services that we will be able to offer on 5G has - why we have been so excited about it, quite frankly and while we put our shoulder behind get in the ecosystem to move faster on this than they otherwise would have been and we look forward to being in position to offer those services in the years ahead."]], ["there is a lot of articles in the press over the last couple years that it might talk close to $20 billion $50 billion to build out a nationwide 5G network.

Even with the price premium we have, it shows that customers value the high-quality network experience that we deliver, and we saw that throughout the quarter.\nSo even as we headed into the back end of the quarter and the competitive environment picked up and some of the other offers that came out there, whether that be large bounties to switch carrier or offering free service, our performance in the back end of the quarter was consistent with where we saw it in the first part of the quarter. So we saw a great result from customers on both the gross adds side and the loyalty side once they had that comparable offer to do. So very excited about how that played out.\nAs we head forward, second quarter is typically, seasonally, the low quarter for churn. So while we certainly expect churn to continue to be at low levels, we'll see if we get a normal seasonal uptick as we go forward. But from a competitive environment standpoint, I think we showed that we competed throughout the quarter without having to put any aggressive promotions in place in the market at any time during the quarter.\nIn terms of 5G, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, we now have the trials up and running. It's going to be later in the year before we start to see results out of those trials.

We saw confirmation of that as recently as yesterday with another one of the third-party surveys that proves that during the first quarter of 2017, even once we were on unlimited, our network performs better than anybody else's, and that's in large part due to what we've been doing for the past number of years on small cell densification.\nI know you hear a lot of other people talk a lot about small cell densification now. Remember that we've been doing that for a longer time period than anyone else, and that's why we're in all of the top metro markets. And we will continue to do that. That will be a continued part of our network capacity plan.

So on the service revenue, I think consistent with what we said earlier in the year, we see second quarter as being the low point and the 6.7% for 2Q will become something better then in 3Q. And in my prepared remarks I believe I \u2013 you heard me say that we'll be inside of negative 4% in the fourth quarter. So in terms of how do we get there, we talked about that 75% of the base in second quarter was on unsubsidized pricing. That compares to 53% a year ago. So there's north of a 20-point movement from second quarter last year to second quarter this year.\nAs you get into the back half of the year \u2013 I'll use fourth quarter as an example. Fourth quarter year-ago, that number was 67%. This year, that number is going top out in the upper 70s. So we're at 75% now. We'll get up to, let's say, 77%. That will only be a 10-point delta in the fourth quarter year over year. So that pressure that's come from taking customers from the subsidized model down to the unsubsidized pricing is starting to wane, and really the second quarter is where we reached the point, we've got essentially the vast majority of the consumer base now on unsubsidized pricing.\nAnd then overage revenues also being, obviously, part of the story here over the past few quarters, first with the introduction of the price plans last year that had the Safety Mode feature and then bringing on unlimited. As we said, we now have 59% of accounts on one of those two plans. Overage was actually down 34% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. Now represents a low single digit percentage part of total service revenues. So we're working through that headwind. We'll work through that headwind a lot faster. And so, as I say, based off that, I am very confident we'll be inside negative 4% in fourth quarter, and by the time we get on this call a year from now and our comparison is against this year being 75% on unsubsidized pricing, we'll be having a very different conversation about the service revenue trajectory next year.\nAnd then on margin improvement, as you know, service revenue is the highest margin component of our business, so as the trajectory on service revenue improves, the trajectory on margin will improve as well."]], ["And I wonder if you could kind of talk about the inputs to that expectation in terms of kind of what you expect from a competitive pricing environment, promotions with the iPhone, et cetera, relative to that mix shift that you've been talking about, as you kind of go past the price down cohort and you move into this group of people that are kind of more pricing up.

We typically have very strong results when we have new devices come out because when customers get a new device with new functions, they want it on the best network, but we'll see what happens there.

Really as you think about that trajectory changing, when you've got growing accounts, growing net adds, when you see the continued improvement in the delta on the non-subsidized pricing and as we work through the overage, all of that will combine to a much stronger trend as we go forward from where we have been.\nIn terms of the impact of any new devices coming along, look, we assume that we'll see something later in the year.

So as we think about that, we would remove out anything that wasn't in the business for all of 2016-2017. So certainly the impact of those businesses have been having about $0.02 a quarter on EPS, so when I think about the guide going forward, it's on an organic basis. Still feel very confident organically we'll be in a consistent place to where we were a year ago, and then we'll bake in the impact of the various acquisitions as we go forward."]], ["Can you talk about how you think about the trade-off specifically between acquiring more spectrum and network densification, and from an economics perspective, and has that shifted at all inside of Verizon?

It really comes down to taking a view on the most efficient way to add the capacity that we need, and we've talked for two or three years now about the fact that we believe based off of the valuations that spectrum have reached in some places, it's more efficient to densify. And certainly the costs of densification, just like with any technology, have come down to some degree since we started densifying with small cell. So the overall analysis we do hasn't fundamentally changed. Look, we continue to add spectrum from the secondary markets, too. So when spectrum is priced at the right level, we continue to be active in that space, too. And we just look at the relative economics between densifying and adding spectrum. But densification has proved to be a very effective way of adding capacity into what places we need to and from a cost efficiency standpoint as well."]], ["Or if you could comment on that.\nAnd then second, if I may, on the One Fiber initiative, it's certainly early to call 2018 CapEx, but do you still feel comfortable that, with the fiber plans you've laid out, or some which we know about, some we probably don't, that that really won't be a huge increase in the CapEx lever next year?

", ["So on the last question, the Corning deal. And as you say $1 billion over three years, it\u2019s certainly not a small number. But when you look within the overall context of our capital spend, it certainly fits in there. So as we go and build out fiber assets, I think you\u2019ll see us do that within our total capital spend. Yes, you will see us spend more on fiber as we go forward. But historically, you\u2019ve seen moves within our capital spend between different components. So this increase in the fiber spend will be offset by reductions in other areas, and that\u2019s the trend you\u2019re seeing consistently for us.\nIn terms of capital spend for the year, the first quarter was certainly a lower quarter and we sometime see. But the first quarter is often a low capital spend quarter for us. So that\u2019s about where we expected it to come in. In terms of the guide for the year, it's too early in the year to say exactly we will be in that range, I am confident we\u2019ll be in that range.

Your question around cash taxes, what you\u2019re seeing there is that you say, first quarter is typically live from a cash taxes standpoint, just because of the timing of when payments are due. As you go through the year, previously we had said the cash taxes would converge closely with the ETR rate. Because of some of the activity we had in the quarter with the discretionary pension contribution and the liability management activity, with cash taxes we\u2019re now actually come-in in a lower rate than the ETR for the year. So that's an improvement to the cash expectation for the year.\nFrom an exit rate of the first quarter, it\u2019s too soon to say just purely extrapolate that number out. But certainly, we\u2019re very confident that the offering is resonated very strongly with the base; both in terms of improvements in churn and also an uptick in growth that, we continue to see that; the rest of the quarter will play out based off of new devices that hit the market; and then also the competitive response, especially as we head into Mother's Day and the Dads and Grads period in June. But we do look forward to a better trajectory from the business with an offer out there that\u2019s certainly resonating with customers."]], ["But it sort of looks like it was up a lot year-over-year, or was the problem in the first six weeks of the year much more gross-add driven and not really a churn problem; and then second, and it sounds like Lowell was not on. ", ["So on the churn question, I think it's, as you say, the first half of the quarter we did see an uptick in churn and then we saw it come back down in the second half with the response to Unlimited. Look, we had a lot of customers in the base who love being on the Verizon network and the performance they get. But certainly managing their data was a pain point, it was another thing to do within their lives. And so they was some interest from the Unlimited functionality and as other people are offering that, we saw some people choose to make that trade off between quality of network, but not having to manage their data.\nAnd so as soon as we went to the Unlimited offering and we gave people the option of not having to make a trade-off, they could have unlimited data and beyond the best network we saw an immediate improvement in the churn number where our base saying this is where we want to be. And we\u2019re certainly seeing that continue as we head into the second quarter.\nNow your second question, so okay, there is obviously been a lot over the past 24-hours around this, so let's break this down. Lowell was asked a question in an interview about if a certain company called and wanted to talk, would he take that meeting. And he responded, sure we\u2019d take that meeting. And if emphasis he added on just like if a couple of other companies called, we\u2019d take the same meeting. What this really comes down to and is consistent with what he said on CNBC interview was, we\u2019re looking to how we execute our strategy; we\u2019re confident in executing our strategy organically. But if there is the right opportunity out there to accelerate the strategy inorganically in a way that adds shareholder value, we\u2019re always looking at those opportunities.\nBut I think the story was a little taken out in context, he was answering a question about, if somebody called would we take a call and would we have a conversation with them. Of course, we would. But we\u2019re also very confident with the assets we have and the plans we have of developing the business in an organic fashion as well and generating shareholder value."]], ["Could you comment on whether you think the dynamics of the -- as we enter the second quarter, are actually a bit better, spread has moved off of it, some of its most aggressive promotions?

But you mentioned, made a comment there Craig about re-lead in networks superiority, that would imply that at some point we didn\u2019t -- we have given up the lead in network superiority, and that clearly hasn\u2019t happened. You can look at any of the third party results of the testing they do over the past year, and you can see if anything we\u2019ve widen the lead. So network superiority will continue to be at the forefront of what we do. We\u2019re very confident that the customers value that. And we\u2019re very confident that we will lead as we move into 5G; we\u2019ll have that network out there first; have customer offering around that technology out there first; and that will give us an opportunity to work to continue to expand the business, just like we have with previous generations of technology.\nIn terms of your dynamics in the second quarter in the marketplace, look we will have to wait and see. Right now, we\u2019re very happy with how the customer base is responding to the offers that we have out there. We\u2019ll have to see what the competition does. And we will continue to be competitive in the marketplace, but we will do that in a disciplined fashion. And we\u2019ll see other quarter plays out."]], ["Just on the follow up question that network superiority, that\u2019s true every third party report seems to have Verizon by a widely ahead, but which leads to the question about spectrum. ", ["So for the 5G trials that we\u2019re doing, we're using the 28 gigahertz spectrum that we have the right to use as part of the arrangement we have with XO. In terms of your broader question about our spectrum position, we\u2019re very confident in it. Approximately 50% of our current spectrum holdings are delivering our 5G network today, so we have significant opportunity to -- about 4G usages there. We have significant opportunities to continue to grow within the spectrum holdings that we currently have; we\u2019re refarming spectrum as we've talked about for a while; we still have the AWS-3 spectrum; and then on license, we\u2019ll come into the portfolio we go forward to.\nIn addition to using spectrum though, the way the spectrum is used continues to get more efficient based off of the network architecture and advancements in the technology; LTE advance we've talked a lot about, they continues to be additions to that. And so as we look forward, we\u2019re very confident that we have the spectrum we need to continue to deliver the best-in-class 4G experience."]], ["Matt, just maybe a comment on the margin trade-off of the ARPA changes that we've seen lot of promotional activity, and you guys have done some yourself there, that sort of versus the lower volumes that we're seeing out there. ", ["So on your last comment around network quality resonating, I would say that completely disagree with that statement. We know from talking with our customers that network quality matters that they value the quality of our network. The fact that they have the reliability to get on the network and stay on the network work, no matter what they\u2019re doing or where they are, is tremendously important to them. And that shows up in the churn rate that we have coming in below 0.9% three quarters in a row and certainly, the improvement we saw there post launch. So this narrative that network no longer matters, I think we completely disagree with and I think that shows up in the numbers and the results that we show.\nIn terms of the margin trade-off I think, look, when you\u2019re looking then to the ARPA decline this is a continuation of decline, because we're breaking apart the service revenue and the handset revenue. When you look at the ARPA number, which is really the billings we give to customer every month that includes the handset billing, that still up year-over-year. So we continue to feel good about that trajectory.\nAnd as you think about our move to Unlimited, we did it in a way where we will added the functionality but it wasn\u2019t a price reduction. We think that this ARPA will be ARPA neutral overtime. We\u2019ll initially seize the impact of optimizes and we\u2019ll also see the impact of reduced overage. But we also have the ability for customers to come on the network on a metered plan and then step up overtime, and even our base is stepping up from some of the lower data buckets to get on Unlimited. So there is some offsets there that we think means that Unlimited is not going to be a reduction in ARPA. And this is why we say when we introduced it, we did show in a disciplined fashion, which is something you should expect to see from us as we go forward and respond to the marketplace."]], ["Just building upon that last question, when you folks originally introduced your outlook for 2017, there was an expectation for a push out in terms of the recovery or the growth of service revenues. ", ["So on the trajectory, we still feel confident that we\u2019ll see an improvement in the wireless trajectory as we go through the year, and a stronger overall result from year-over-year number versus last year. Now, what we will see is in the second quarter we\u2019ll see a continuation of the impact of the optimizations, both through the customers that came onto the Verizon plan last summer and also on Unlimited. But then the back half of the year, we\u2019ll see the trend start to improve and we continue to be confident that we\u2019ll see wireless service revenue get back to positive on a year-over-year basis during 2018.\nSo I think the big thing as you look there is we continue to keep pricing at the right levels. We have the opportunity to step customers up. And as we more successful in adding customers in the marketplace, as we showed in the back half of the quarter, that gives us the opportunity to move those trends in the right direction."]], ["Matt, it seems like some of your competitors have really been aggressive on splashing OpEx and CapEx, and I know now just had a little bit more time to look at Verizon and what your competitors have done. ", ["So I would say they have been talking about these reductions in OpEx over the past year or two. I think you\u2019ve heard us talk about it for more years in that now. We continue to look at and manage the cost of the business down, and I think you see that in results. You certainly can see it clearly in the results in the Wireline segment, for example. So we look at managing OpEx and reducing it, not as a program for a year or two but something we do every year. Every year we have cost reduction targets for each of the business units and they diligently work on those and have a great track record of delivering them.\nAs I think about CapEx, one of the great things about our business is we produce a significant amount of cash flow that allows us to continue to invest in the business. And we do that so that we position the business to be able to deliver products and offer our customers just for today but as we head into the future, because the nature of the business we\u2019re in, we're always looking at least one to two years out in terms of what we need. So we continue to do that and make sure that we're providing the connectivity solutions that our customers need as we go forward.\nHowever, saying that, we look at how we get -- continue to get more efficient in there. And you will see us continually do that, the cost to add capacity in the network continues to come down and it comes down because of the things our network team has done for many years and how we work with the vendors in the space. So we don\u2019t make as much of a big deal about what we do to manage OpEx and CapEx efficiencies. But I can absolutely guarantee you it's a key focus within the business and we have a great track record of doing that.\nIn terms of the reorganization, I think look, this is just an opportunity to make sure we stay focused on the key things to us, which is the network and continuing to build the network; not just the network of today but the networks we need going forward; the focus on managing the customer base and growing the base, retaining the base and generating loyalty; and then generating those new businesses, whether that be in the Media Co, Telematics or the broad IoT space.

And we've taken a lot of learnings from that.\nAnd when I say we, I mean both David Altshuler in research and Reshma in development. The first thing is that we work on validated targets. With cell markers and biomarkers in preclinical development, they can predict clinical success, and that both increases the probability of success when we get into the clinic, but also speeds the work forward. Don't spend a lot of time in animal models. We move more rapidly into humans.\nAnd in all cases, and we'll talk about our pipeline, we have biomarkers in the clinic that predict early success with small clinical trials in CF. As you remember, 18- or 20-patient phase II trials pretty much tells us the answer. And as you'll see, that's true also of diseases like AAT and sickle cell and pain. And so we're certainly taking that lesson forward as well.\nYou also asked about leveraging knowledge, and I do want to comment on one distinction. The way that we believe in leveraging knowledge is by leveraging scientific knowledge and not therapeutic area knowledge. In other words, you asked about COPD as an example. We don't have COPD programs even given what we've done in CF because we don't see the same scientific opportunity in COPD than we see in CF. And so we really pick by disease, not by therapeutic area. Disease is where we see large unmet need and scientific opportunity.\nAnd then we do leverage that experience and knowledge into those. AAT is probably the best example because it looks and smells so much like CF. But obviously, it's a genetic disease like CF. It's protein folding disorder like CF. We have a cell system and an animal system that we believe will predict clinical efficacy, and we have a simple biomarker and small trials that will tell us whether we're going to succeed or not.\nAnd so I think you can expect to see very rapid progress in the disease like AAT for the same reasons as in CF. And then maybe the final thing I would say is we do believe very strongly in this portfolio approach, and so you won't see us take rifle shots in these diseases. You'll see us create multiple molecules, and we have that in pain, we have it in AAT, we have it in FSGS, and we'll take multiple molecules into the clinic, which I think is a very important way to reduce risk."]], ["First, on the commercial side, could you give us an update on where the negotiations that have been going on in France over reimbursement stand and whether there's any milestones that we externally could look for through the remainder of 2019 for progress in those negotiations?\nThen secondly, on the clinical side, I'm curious about VX-121 and VX-561. ", ["Phil, it's Stuart here. I'll take your commercial question and then Reshma will take the clinical question. So as I said previously, we've reached multiple reimbursement agreements around the world over the last couple of years, and I'm pleased to say, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've continued to make a good progress in the first quarter.\nBut we are certainly fully committed to securing access where we don't, so that all eligible patients can have access to our approved medicines. Every country is different, so I'll talk about England, and then I'll talk about France. As you know, we participated in the Health Select Committee inquiry in England in March that allowed us to explain our position on our company, the value of our medicines and the approach that we were taking to those negotiations.\nAnd I think one of the most positive things out of that inquiry was that we are now back at the table with the NHS and NICE, and I see that as a very positive impact from the Health Select Committee inquiry.\nIn France, we continue to be in productive discussions with the French authorities and, likewise, we're fully committed there to securing access for any patients that don't have access. I would remind you in France, approximately 1,100 or so of the 1,700 ORKAMBI-eligible patients above 12 were initiated on ORKAMBI and continue to be on ORKAMBI through our early-access programs. And we are being kind of paid for those patients, but we won't recognize revenue for those patients till a final reimbursement agreement is secured. So what I can tell you is we are fully committed to getting access for those patients who've been waiting too long in England and those patients who are still waiting in France as well. I wish I could tell you exactly when we're going to reach a successful conclusion. Unfortunately, that's just not within our ability to predict that. So unfortunately, I can't point you to any specific milestones because there really aren't any along the way that would be externally visible.\nReshma Kewalramani\nPhil, it's Reshma. With regard to VX-121, this is our next-generation corrector, and we have initiated these trials, and this is now in its Phase II proof-of-concept stage. It's a little too early to tell you when we're going to have the results, but I think from the speed that you can see us moving, I expect that we're going to continue to move with that kind of pace as VX-121 makes it through Phase II.\nWith regard to VX-561, that's the deuterated ivacaftor molecule, and you'll remember the FDA asked us to take that through full-dose ranging in monotherapy, and that's the study that we're initiating now. You are right that VX-561 is in combination with VX-121 in the proof-of-concept study.\nBut I will say that because we're doing the monotherapy full-dose ranging, actually, we compare VX-561 with any next-generation corrector pair that we think is most appropriate. 121 is certainly one of those opportunities."]], ["Can you just maybe walk through what you're comparing and what you're looking at to figure out at what point you're going to pick one of those for both het/min and homozygous?\nAnd then my second question was on the AAT program. ", ["Sure. This is Reshma. Let me take the first question first and then we'll get to AAT. So as we've discussed on our calls in the past, we are marching down the strategy that we laid out with regard to asset selection. And really, if I break that down, what that means is that we are going to be looking at 24-week data for both FS and FMS for both assets, VX-659 and VX-445. The 445 study went even faster than the 659 study, and that's really what set us up to have this opportunity to look at both sets of 24-week data. And you've actually gleaned exactly the right point. Because we can look at both 24-week data sets, we're going to be filing for both, FS and FMS, regardless of which asset we choose.\nWith regard to how we're going to make the asset decision, you know who would have ever guessed that the efficacy would be at this level and literally superimposable. And that means we're going to be looking at the full totality of evidence. And of course, it means ppFEV1, but it also means things like pulmonary exacerbation, all the other secondary endpoints and, importantly, the full package of safety information. We're on track to make this decision in Q2 of this year and, importantly, file in Q3 of this year, regardless of whether the asset selection is 445 or 659.\nAn important thing to share with you is with regard to VX-445. That study has achieved its last patient last visit as of very recently, and so we're really in very good shape and a lot of progress since the last call.\nWith regard to the AAT program, I'm going to step back a little bit just to make sure everyone has all the information. So that molecule is VX-814, and we just announced today, and I'm delighted to reiterate that, that molecule has received fast track status from the FDA. That's important because I think it gives you an indication of the high unmet need as well as the recognition that therapies are needed to improve the condition of these patients who have a very serious illness.\nThat study started the SAD, single ascending dose, multiple ascending dose in December of last year. We're going to have the PK results from that study. And then well, I don't know the exact size. It's going to be efficient, as Jeff described in his prepared remarks.\nThis is very much like CF, and we anticipate that 30, 40, 50 patients, something like that, is what we're going to need to examine, and the readout is very straightforward. It's AAT levels, and we know how to do that. So I anticipate that, that's kind of what you're going to expect to see as this program comes to fruition."]], ["I believe Jeff mentioned previously that even with the clinical benefit of the triple combination you observed, still the nice methodology may not come out with the pricing that's close to what you think is the value of this medication. ", ["Yes. This is Jeff, Ying. Thanks for the 2 questions and, obviously, they're related. So just to be clear on the triple, the NICE methodology has, as you know, a number of different components to it, major one is the value of medicine to patients as described by the clinical results and, clearly, there the triple is significantly better than the other 2 existing medicines that they've already evaluated. They haven't yet evaluated the triple in their system, so it's a little early to tell, but we certainly know from the clinical data that there is a major benefit.\nWith respect to the more general question of the NICE methodology and how well it applies to these kinds of precision medicines, I think you know that there's been quite a bit of discussion in the U.K. and in Parliament about the fact that it's probably time to take another look at that NICE methodology, not for community medicines and not for the ultra-orphans, where it seems to work well, but for exactly this kind of precision medicine for the patient populations that fall in between. And we do anticipate and hope over the next couple of years that, that methodology may be revised as per the current discussions to better evaluate the value of these medicines. Obviously, that's going to help, too.\nWith respect to the average blended price, I think you can -- we, obviously, don't give long-term guidance on price. Certainly, it's too early for triple price. We don't give long-term guidance on revenue either, but I think one way to think about this is we're currently treating about 18,000 patients, generating about $3 billion in revenue.\nAs we go to a triple world, where the benefit to patients is greater, we certainly don't anticipate major decrease as in the price of our triple versus our other medicines, given its value. And so you can begin to sort of do some rough math around as we move from 18,000 to potentially 65,000 or 68,000 eligible patients what that might look like across the world."]], ["On the AAT program, what gives you the most confidence that the AAT produced will be functional and that the liver outflow will reverse damage from the prior accumulation of toxic polymers to the same degree in humans who may have the disease long term as you saw in the transgenic mouse model? ", ["Yes. Maybe I'll take the AAT question and Stuart will like the inventory question, I think. So on AAT, those -- you're asking the most important questions. And one of the things we really like about the program is that we're able to test our correctors in both cells and in a transgenic animal that are actually expressing the mutant human protein, not a mutant mouse protein.\nSo they're engineered with the human protein. And we can measure not only the levels, but we can actually measure functional levels. So we're not simply measuring by immunoassay the levels of this protein, we're actually measuring the functional levels. And that's how we had great confidence that we're actually producing functional protein and, in fact, we're clearing both the cells, and as you've seen -- if you saw my JPMorgan presentation, we're clearing the liver in these animals of the misfolded human mutant protein.\nAnd that gives us a high level of confidence that we are actually able to produce -- not only to correct the folding, but produce functional protein once we do it, and that's a very, very important piece of the data package, which has encouraged us to move rapidly with humans.\nNow humans, as Reshma said, we're going to be able to measure the same thing. We'll not only measure the serum levels of protein, which we can obviously do, but we'll actually measure the functional levels of protein in the serum. And we know from essentially an experimentative nature from the heterozygous parents of these patients, who are normal, by the way, and they express anywhere from 11 micromolar on probably 17 micromolar is really -- a functional protein is really fully protective. And so we can simply measure the levels of functional protein in these treated patients and, again, with rather small trials, like the CF trials, know exactly where we are. But the cell data and the mouse data used in the human protein gives us the high level of confidence. Did that answer your question?"]], ["First of all, with SYMDEKO, at this stage of launch, roughly what percent of patients are still switching to SYMDEKO from other regimens versus those that are new to therapy altogether? ", ["Yes. So Corey, I'll take those. So in terms of the switching and where are we versus uptake in na\u00efve, we really only got data around that for a substantial period of time here in the U.S., obviously, because we launched SYMDEKO here in February of 2018. What I'll tell you is we've actually seen really high levels of uptake in whole of the populations you might expect, those patients who are na\u00efve to ORKAMBI, those who've never been exposed to a CFTR modulator before, those who were on ORKAMBI and those who had tried ORKAMBI and discontinued.\nSo all of those groups we saw very substantial uptake. We're on the flatter path of the launch curve, I would say, here in the U.S., but we're certainly not flat. There are still patients being added in all of those categories just about every day. And the other one, I think, I would say that we are able to be much more confident about now in the real world is we had always thought that given the profile of SYMDEKO that we would expect to see high levels of persistence and compliance, higher than we had seen with ORKAMBI. And I'm pleased to say that's exactly what's playing out in the real world.\nIn terms of deuterated ivacaftor 561, certainly, given the uptake rates we see with our medicines, clearly, a twice-a-day regimen for medicines, which are as important as this, treating the underlying course of the disease is not something which is inhibiting people from taking our medicines. And then indeed, as you know, these patients are taking many, many different types and forms of medicines every day. And so twice-a-day medicine is not difficult for them. However, our goal is to get to carrier levels of status and provide as much convenience as we possibly can for the patients. And so we do see once-a-day being something that would be an advantage for our medicines, and that's why we want to bring 561 to patients as soon as we possibly can."]], ["I was wondering if there are any biomarkers you can look at in early studies that can detect whether or not your compound is having the benefit in the liver that you hope anything related to inflammation or liver enzyme elevations? ", ["Sure. Let me take the NaV1.8 first and then I'll go backwards to AAT. So with regard to Phase III design, I think the 3 models that we've talked about are a good way to think about it, the musculoskeletal pain and osteoarthritis, but there are, obviously, a number of other pain conditions in musculoskeletal that we could pursue. And in the small fiber neuropathy, which is what we did in the VX-150 example, there is, of course, trigeminal neuralgia and other pain conditions that one would pursue to get the full breadth of neuropathic pain.\nAnd bunionectomy as a model of acute pain, I think the kind of studies you could imagine are bunionectomy, which would be the hard tissue, something like an abdominoplasty or a hernia repair as some of the soft tissue example. And the guidance is actually fairly straightforward with regard to what kind of studies you need to do and the approximate sample size for any one of these conditions. So I think what you'll see us do is bring the best molecule forward and then use the fairly typical Phase III development path to get these approved.\nWith regard to AAT, I think the question was around how we're going to figure out whether or not there is liver impact. So this is kind of interesting. There is a paper from the Brantly Lab down in Florida, and it was out maybe 2 years ago, November or something like that, and what you can tell is that perhaps AAT is best known clinically as a disease that looks like COPD, just COPD in younger people. There's actually a substantial burden of liver disease, and that liver disease is manifest when you do something like a liver biopsy, which is what that Brantly series did. It actually looked at about 100-or-so patients over time.\nNow with regard to inflammatory markers, the markers of liver disease, AST, ALT, that actually doesn't give you a very good idea. GGT is said to be very best, but it's not very sensitive nor is it particularly specific. But I think what something that Jeff said is really the important point. In our animal models, what we're doing is actually looking at liver tissue. So there's no guesswork here, and it's not a question of whether we see enzymes moving. We're actually looking at the liver cells with the misfolded protein and then the clearance of that with VX-814. And I anticipate that as we go to clinical studies, biopsies are going to be an important part of that. I hope that answers the question."]], ["And my sense is that the pace of uptake for SYMDEKO, which had better data than ORKAMBI, has been broader and quicker in the United States than in Europe and the rest of the world. ", ["Yes. So I would say, in the U.S., we have always managed to get very broad access to our CFTR moderators, starting with KALYDECO and through ORKAMBI and now to SYMDEKO and even for each of the individual label expansions that we've had over time. So I don't think there's really a very substantial time difference. Certainly, I think payers are getting more accustomed to these agents and to the disease, and I think that's helping. So I think we are seeing some acceleration here in the U.S., but it's not huge. What I think you're seeing play out outside the U.S. actually is the -- is a couple of things.\nFirstly, you're seeing the benefit of our portfolio agreements, and this was exactly what they were designed to do. They were designed to reduce the time lag between regulatory approval and reimbursement approval so the patients and physicians could access to our newest and best medicines as soon as they possibly can. And so that I think is what's leading to the acceleration in patients being able to access SYMDEKO or SYMKEVI outside the U.S. versus what we saw with ORKAMBI.\nAnd then separately, in Germany, what you're seeing is actually the launch of SYMKEVI is going substantially better than the launch of ORKAMBI. I think the team has done a terrific job there. Certainly, the benefit-risk profile of the agent helps, but certainly, the team has done an excellent job executing there in Germany, and the SYMKEVI launch is tracking substantially above the ORKAMBI launch at the same time point. We're seeing initiations in na\u00efve patients. We're seeing initiations in patients who had discontinuations. And we're also seeing some switching as well. And so I think that's really an example of the team executing really well.\nMichael Partridge\nOperator, we'll take 2 more questions."]], ["Jeff, I know we've kind of talked around this a little before, but I just wanted to kind of push you again on the consideration of 659 and 445 and which one you'll ultimately move forward with. ", ["Yes. It's a good question, Brian. We have talked about it a little bit before. And what we're balancing is our level of confidence in the information versus the potential confusion of patients and physicians when we're trying to launch 2 drugs simultaneously into the same population. And I think the good news here, and this is what Reshma has said before, is just how good the efficacy data that we're seeing is. And so, so far what we're seeing is it's a hard choice because they're so similar.\nAnd if that turns out to be true when we look at the 24-week data, and we're seeing this kind of superior efficacy not only across primary endpoint, but across all the secondary endpoints, I think we're going to have a very high level of confidence that whichever asset we choose as the best one is going to be very, very good for these patients.\nAnd then on the other side of the equation, as you know, as I know from being around for a while, trying to launch 2 drugs simultaneously into 1 patient population and explain that to doctors and patients can be very, very confusing. And once you do that, the ability to ultimately make your decision and withdraw 1 drug is virtually impossible.\nAnd so you're committed to, long term, having 2 drugs on the market that look identical and in different patient populations. And I think that's probably not the best thing to do for patients. So at the end of the day, the decision is it's best for patients to make the decision on the best asset and bring it to them. And we feel like we have enough data now in hundreds of patients so that we're going to be confident of what we're going to see."]], ["I mean in chronic therapy, whether it's NRTIs in HIV or TNF-alphas, we really don't get kind of the full picture of efficacy and safety until you have tens of thousands of patient years behind you.

", ["Sure thing. This is Reshma. I'm going to tackle the first question, and I'm going to toss it over to Jeff to talk about pain. So as you know, our long-stated goal, and it remains today, is to bring therapies for all patients with CF. And in there, what we're trying to do is bring patients to carrier level. That's really, really important. And that also ties back to a point that Stuart made, we want to bring the most convenient regimen that brings all patients to carrier level.\nAnd so what we're doing is in our labs in San Diego is we have assays and many of you have seen them are our HBE cells that we now have a plethora of data of how these assays translate to the Phase II and Phase III results. And so we pick the best of the best molecules that come out of our labs. And when they meet these thresholds -- and I admit it, we have set an extremely high bar. When there are molecules like VX-121 that meet this high bar, we advance them to the clinic to meet this ultimate goal. Jeff?\nJeffrey Leiden\nYes. With respect to the pain question, it's a bit similar to what Reshma was talking about before in terms of portfolio modules. First thing I would say is we have, I think, convinced ourselves and others that we have very high efficacy molecules here with 150 and the approach we've taken. I think we've convinced ourselves with a reasonable number of patients that VX-150 is highly tolerable, and we're also very convinced that there's not addictive potential of these drugs. Those were the high things -- high bar we were trying to match for a new pain compound.\nNow we're in the process of picking the best drug, and that involves a lot of other things. So for example, is it formulatable both IV and p.o., whether any manufacturing issues, cost of goods issues, dosing, dose scheduling. So in pain, what we'd like to have is the best molecule that combines efficacy, tolerability, lack of addictive potential, but also the right dose, the right dosing regimen, the IV to p.o. transition in the hospital. It's a pretty high bar, but because we have a whole portfolio of molecules, we believe we will find that molecule, and that's the one that we really want to take through Phase III and to commercialize."]], ["How should we think about that?\nAnd then second question was more of a modeling finance question which is that obviously, the triples are advancing forward like you said, but ORKAMBI and SYMDEKO are pretty big franchises. ", ["This is Reshma. Let me start by taking the first part of the question with regard to VX-561. As you know and we've talked about this on previous calls, the FDA had asked us to do additional dose-ranging before proceeding to Phase 3 and part of that request was to study VX-561 across these dose ranges in gaining patients and we've had productive discussions with the agency and we're now at the point where we've designed our study, we've selected our doses, and I expect that this study will get started next year, probably in the first half or so. Stuart?\nStuart A. Arbuckle - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nYeah, Mike, and on the question of what do we think the triple combinations might do to the doublets, certainly, if we see the sort of results in Phase 3 that we saw in Phase 2 in the homozygous population where, as you know, we saw the triple combinations deliver very, very substantial increases in clinical benefit over and above a baseline of tezacaftor and ivacaftor. If those results hold true, then our expectation would be that the vast majority of patients would be transferred to a triple combination rather than staying on a doublet just given the significant benefit risk improvement that we saw in those Phase 2 studies."]], ["sales of ORKAMBI in the quarter and how'd they compare to SYMDEKO?\nAnd given that they're probably not too far off, what is your sense of SYMDEKO's penetration of its U.S. ", ["Sure. Hey, Phil. It's Stuart. So I'll try and answer all those. So, for ORKAMBI in the U.S., we recorded net revenues of $236 million for the quarter compared to the $186 million that Ian referenced for SYMDEKO.\nIn terms of how the launch is going, as Jeff said in his prepared remarks, we've actually seen strong uptake across the three different patient populations that we were anticipating that we'd see demand in. That's those who have tried ORKAMBI previously and discontinued, those who have never been exposed to a CFTR modulator either ORKAMBI or KALYDECO and we saw a fair amount of transitions from ORKAMBI to SYMDEKO. And that's the reason why you see the sequential decline for ORKAMBI from Q1 to Q2.\nIn terms of for the balance of the year, whilst the launch is off to a strong start, we do continue to expect that there is a further growth opportunity for SYMDEKO because they're not yet, as you might expect four or so months into the launch, we're not yet fully penetrated into those patient populations that were either na\u00efve or have seen patients discontinue."]], ["Actually \u2013 to follow up on the last question, would you consider disclosing the data for both triples at the same time or would they be staggered one by one or, yeah, would they be disclosed once you submit the NDA?

As Jeff made, just previously in the comments, we've just announced that we expect to complete enrollment in the second half of this year.\nWe are comfortable based on that, though, saying that we expect to file an NDA in the U.S. by, be no later than mid, next year or mid-2019. But to start talking about how we will disclose data and how it rolls out and whether these studies are close enough together to do it both together, it's just a little too early. We know it's an important issue to you and to other investors.

", ["Yes. Brian, thanks for the question. So, in terms of specifically where we are in the UK and Australia, the two countries that you referenced, in the UK, obviously, we recently received a counteroffer from the NHS. We and many in the CF community believe that offer significantly undervalues both our current and our future medicines. And so, we're not able to accept that offer.\nAnd in terms of next steps, we're looking to meet with those \u2013 the Head of the NHS and indeed the Minister of Health to try and progress those discussions because, as I said, we're not certainly going to give up on fighting for access for those patients in the UK, who've been waiting too long.\nIn Australia, ORKAMBI, both the 6 to 11 indication and the 12-plus indication were reviewed by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, PBAC, in Australia which is the body that reviews both clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness. We're yet to receive the formal minutes from that meeting. And when we do, which will be in the next few weeks, then that will help us determine what the path forward there is.\nWhat I would say is that, as I referenced in the answer to an earlier question, we have successfully secured pricing and reimbursement in a number of other countries in Europe where now thousands of patients are now able to access ORKAMBI. And importantly, we are able there to strike pricing and reimbursement agreements which we believe give us a fair price for the level of clinical benefit and innovation that ORKAMBI delivers. And we need that fair return to enable us to continue the journey in CF and other diseases as Jeff was describing in his prepared remarks.\nSo, we are going to continue to fight for access in the UK and Australia to get access for those patients who've been waiting too long. But we can only do that at a price which fairly reflects the value of the medicines and the benefit they bring for patients."]], ["The only surprise really is that you're not going ahead with a pivotal trial with VX-561, and I wonder if you could give us a little bit more understanding as to the basis for the FDA's decision. ", ["Hey Geoff, it's Ian. Maybe we could actually separate that question into two parts, which maybe we have Reshma talk about the data and Jeff Leiden talk about how we intend to incorporate VX-561 into our regimen as we go forward. I would remind you, back in earlier this year, we look forward to getting results from VX-561. It was pending data and pending discussions with the FDA and maybe we can give you a little more insight into that. So Reshma, do you want to talk about the data first, and then Jeff on the strategy to incorporation?\nReshma Kewalramani - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nSure, sure. So, as you know, in both the VX-659 and the VX-445 proof of concept studies, we had one part that included VX-561 in place of ivacaftor. And let me walk you through the results in terms of efficacy and safety. On the efficacy side, as you heard in the prepared remarks, we had an improvement in ppFEV1 of 11.7 and 12.2 percentage points, respectively, for VX-445 and VX-659. Really impressive results that we were very pleased with.\nOn the safety side, the results were remarkably similar to what we've seen in our ivacaftor studies. And when we looked at these results, both on efficacy and safety, we were very impressed with what we saw and impressed with the consistency of the safety profile. Jeff?\nJeffrey M. Leiden, M.D., Ph.D. - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nYes. So Geoff, as you said, we've got those results, and obviously, you need to have the Phase 2 results before you go and discuss Phase 3 design with the FDA, which we did over the last several weeks and months. And it became clear to us that the way the FDA was looking at VX-561 despite the fact that, as you say, it's really a deuterated version of KALYDECO is that's a new chemical entity. And the kinds of information they're asking for, for instance, some of the dose ranging and potential monotherapy is exactly the kinds of things that they would typically ask for a new chemical entity, particularly before it goes into a combination regimen. And so our decision was \u2013 because our goal has always been to get the best regimen to patients as quickly as possible, we decided to move forward with VX-445 with KALYDECO because that's the quickest route and we didn't want to take a delay.\nHaving said that, I also think that the decision was probably a bit influenced by the fact that KALYDECO has been so well studied in so many thousands of patients and, frankly, it set a very, very high bar, both in terms of efficacy and safety. And so they have a lot of comfort with it, and that made it, I think, easier to enable us to move forward more quickly with that regimen.\nHaving said all that, as Reshma said, the data for VX-561 is quite compelling. We do plan to take it forward into a once a day regimen. We're still in discussions with the FDA about exactly what data they are going to need in some of these, Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. But we think that's highly doable, we just don't want to wait. So as soon as we know that, we'll progress those studies and we'll work out a bridging strategy that allows us to bring VX-561 along with either VX-659 or VX-445 whichever one we choose to patients."]], ["And then on the pipeline side, when you think about the future triples, beyond VX-659 or VX-445, I get the strategy with VX-561, but what would be the real objective here? ", ["Yeah. It's a great question, Geoff. As I said before, we have now reasonably large number of additional next-gen correctors that are flowing through research and into late preclinical development. And so the decision that we're going to make, and we'll have to start making it soon because some of those are moving along quickly is, are they significantly better, do we believe than the two that are currently moving forward, VX-445 and VX-659. And significantly better is really the whole profile of the medicine, right? So it's certainly efficacy, but it's also once a day formulatability, dose, for instance, potency. All those things will go into our decision. But at the end of the day, the decision will be if we feel we have a molecule that's significantly better than the other two, we'll take it forward into Phase 1, and certainly into early Phase 2. That's easy and quick to do. If we don't, we won't."]], ["You're implying that you need to actually prove it out as a full potentiator and run it as a monotherapy program and prove that it's an active potentiator for new compounds. ", ["Yeah, Mike. This is Jeff. I'll take the first part. Maybe Ian will take the second one, was your disclosure question. With respect to the first part, I never comment on what the FDA is going to want for other people's programs. I do think it's informative that they view VX-561 as a new chemical entity, because as Geoff Porges mentioned, it's quite similar to KALYDECO, but clearly different. So I don't think it's unreasonable. Obviously, as compounds get more and more different and newer and newer, I think that they're going to have the same expectations for new chemical entities pretty much across the board, but obviously that's up to them.\nIan F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nAnd Mike, to your question on disclosure, I don't really want to design the disclosure and what we include in that at this point in time. So it will be \u2013 we'll complete the study, we'll gather the data, what does the data inform us in terms of a filing strategy. And I think that's what you could imagine us disclosing. And the timing to that, we'll let you know when we're further into the studies.

", ["Sure. So let me start with the question that you had on the clinical side. Where we are right now is that we've completed our proof of concept studies for both VX-659 and VX-445, and what that means is we've treated about 200 patients.\nIn that 200 patient experience, we have a low incidence of rash overall and the low severity. We have no serious events. These rashes have resolved with discontinuation of treatment or interruption. And interestingly on that latter point we've had a couple of cases where patients have interrupted their therapy for a period and then restarted and completed their course without trouble.\nTo give you some context for this, KALYDECO and ORKAMBI, the rashes that we're seeing in our next-gen program are very similar in incidence and quality is what's been seen there, and you can look in the USPI and you'll see ORKAMBI is about 7%, and KALYDECO is about 13% or so.\nIan F. Smith - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nTerence, to your question on SYMDEKO, I'd first draw you to the kind of the top line revenues, CF total revenues and comment on that, which is the inventory in the channel at December 31, 2017, was similar to the inventory in the channel at March 31, 2018. So what that tells you is that the channel has remained even between those two periods, and therefore, the revenue number is real demand in Q1.\nAs to your question to SYMDEKO, there was some slight channel build, but that was offset to some channel decline on KALYDECO and ORKAMBI from December 31 period. In summary, total CF revenues in Q1 were the real demand and it was not channel build."]], ["So, I guess, my first question is really how are you managing that, operationally, the potential for healthier or more highly motivated patients to come into these Phase 3s and maybe perhaps skew the results or reflect the different population studied in Phase 2. ", ["Sure. So you know we have the benefit of having worked with CF patients in this community for some time now and executing not only Phase 2 studies, but Phase 3 studies as well, in the patient populations that we're studying now in VX-659 and VX-445. And the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the discussions with sites, the way that the sites are screening patients and such, are fairly well described, and what we're doing in Phase 3 is similar to what we ourselves just completed in Phase 2. So I feel very good about how the operations are running and the timelines on which we are enrolling these studies."]], ["So understanding that the absolute difference for VX-445 and VX-659 was similar, but when looking at the placebo adjusted data for VX-659, it looks to be quite a bit better, at least on ppFEV1, since the placebo did quite poorly. ", ["Yeah, thanks for the question. Actually, as we look at the data, the thing that's impressed us most, Shawn, is the consistency of the data. It's pretty remarkable to me to see four to six different Phase 2 trials with different agents and different combinations that are all generating almost identical results, not only in terms of ppFEV1, by the way, but in terms of sweat chloride, in terms of CFQ-R, et cetera. And it's obviously very important that these are placebo-controlled studies and that we're seeing statistical significance in very small numbers of patient.\nSo I guess, our interpretation is what's remarkable is the consistency across the board between different regimens. We don't see a difference between VX-561. Any of those small differences are really just due to the patient numbers. And so, no, that didn't drive any of our decision-making nor do I believe it drove the FDA's decision-making about how to proceed with VX-561. It's really just a matter of their view that this is a new chemical entity and their desire to have the appropriate early data set before we move into Phase 3 and we'll get that."]], ["Now that you got clarity on the Phase 3 design and entering a little bit more of a execution phase right now, any shift in focus or attention on the BD front? ", ["Yeah, thanks for the questions, both good questions. First one on BD. Really, there isn't a shift. As Ian said in his prepared remarks, we have been accelerating, revving up our BD efforts for the last several years with the same consistent strategy around CF platforms and early-stage transformative products.\nWe continue to look and be very active in that space. You can expect to see us to do more deals similar to the ones that we've done already, say, with a CRISPR or Moderna, Parion, et cetera. And because we have more firepower, we have more flexibility in terms of the size of those deals. And so some of them may be even larger than the ones we've done already. So I don't think there's really a change, but there's certainly a very active effort. It's just part of our focus on diversifying our pipeline beyond CF, both through internal research and external collaborations or acquisitions. Maybe, Reshma, do you want to comment a little on the placebo arm and the CFQ-R?\nReshma Kewalramani - Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nSure. So as we looked at the CFQ-R results across VX-659 and VX-445, actually across all the doses that we studied, and in all the populations that we studied, what you see is big double-digit improvements in CFQ-R. In the study, the one VX-445 study, you rightly point out that there's anomaly in the placebo group. In essence, there are two patients that are just plain different and that difference is what drove that CFQ-R value there. But you're right. It's an anomaly and it comes from two patients out of eight, small numbers."]], ["And how do you keep those placebo patients on the triple placebo for het/min?\nAnd the other question I had was, you had a great quarter of SYMDEKO, what are you thinking about in the back end like reasonable assumptions can get you above your guidance.

", ["Sure. Jessica. Look I'm extremely excited about our domestic ad picture. Let me start by commenting on the market. As you know it remains very strong both in Q4, now in Q1 which scatter premiums in both broadcast and cable with 25% to 35% above upfront. Broadly speaking, the issue remains supply not demand and related to that we are all seeing strong and growing demand for premium digital video.\nNow if you look more at our performance, particularly in Q4, which I think is helpful to give you insight into where we see this going. Overall domestic ad revenues were flat. Now that is driven in part by the fact that there was not a lot of political ad spend in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2018. That was a midterm election year. And of course, we have a little decline in impressions but very strong pricing.\nBut the real thing to look at is domestic cable at 9% growth with Pluto. That is the strategy we have been pursuing over the last year and a half. It is a strategy of combining linear with our advanced marketing solutions. It is really resonating in the market and as promised it is delivering robust growth despite impression headwinds. It is allowing us to dramatically outperform all cable competitors.\nAnd it is worth noting that AMS is now almost a fifth of our revenue in the quarter, including with CBS. So this is a real piece of business. Looking forward, it is why we are so excited about our position in the market as ViacomCBS, we are now the clear number one leader. We are number one on every download of linear.\nAnd our AMS offering is even larger as we add CBS granted digital video, including CBS All Access, CBSN, which has grown super fast and more, which means our combined linear AMS sell something we know how to bring to market is even more robust. And as you pointed out, Jessica, our ad sales integration is moving very quickly.\nI'm thrilled with Jo Ann's leadership. John Haley is the COO who knows the advanced ad space.

Really, the middle one, we think makes a lot of sense. In terms of what we need to do, the reason we are so excited about this is it is not vaporware. We are filling from a position of strength.\nAs we said, we have about $1.6 billion in domestic streaming and digital ad revenue in 2019, that is up 60% from 2018. We have MAU's at the end of 2019, at $22 million, actually more than $22 million, and over $11 million domestic subs in pay.\nSo that is a real foundation and we are taking that and we are building on the experience we already have. We have benefit in terms of lessons learned in subscriber acquisition, insurance management. We understand what gets consumed in free and pay cause we have been looking at it for awhile.\nWe are not launching something new, your question on tech. We are working off of proven platforms and models and we know how to work with partners both in the traditional and OTT space.

The live event \u2013 live television is also a differentiator for us.

But now, it\u2019s actually should be called, we said pause, because it\u2019s what we call easy on, easy off. So it\u2019s easy to come in and out of these subscription services. So what we are trying to do is, make sure we have these subscribers year around which just really improves the lifetime value of that subscriber.\nSo our focus is really always on that lifetime value, the revenue that we can get from each subscriber.

", ["Alexia, it's Joe. Just All Access subs, two-thirds of the All Access subs are taking the limited commercial option. So obviously, the vast majority of that that's a 99 price point. Obviously, there is still advertising in the live linear portion of that. So we do have that two-pronged approach, but we obviously operate with a subsidy of advertising for 599. And so like I said, the mix is there. We're very cognizant of the pricing, so we premium price the stuff on Digital so that it doesn't lower the price point on linear. So we are sensitive to that. So we're very -- we are indifferent if somebody signs up for 599 plus the advertising or the 999. I think again more and more just to consumer preferences are leading to the ad free eliminate adds as I said the 99 product and as we roll that out internationally, we will obviously be going again with the commercial-free option.\nSo as we're sitting here today, I think the subscription revenue is a huge opportunity, but again the advertising and the targeting capabilities is also big. The key program will roll out later this year. Like I said it's 1,000 hours. There is going to be some library but new original seasons of some pretty big franchises and again because of the average age of those subscribers have young children, we just thought it was such a sweet spot really a natural way to expand our premium content. So we're really going to look for some proof points there to expand the sub base based on expanding the product offering. So we feel pretty good about that.\nChris Spade\nAnd Alexia, this is Chris, just to answer your marketing question. We will market more and we have been marketing more consistently this year with our added original series offerings."]], ["But my question I guess is how much of this asset that you've built so far and continue to build is fuel specifically as you grow these domestic OTT platforms that you've laid out some goals for us and how much is monetizable being contemplated for monetization, whether it's through licensing or international? ", ["Yes, look, I think that's a very good point, Mike. I think again some of these assets, we're building again as that for our own services. And that's based on the research that we have from all of the data, we're getting when subscribers churn. And so we know original series really drive intend to subscribe. We know key engagement metrics as we put more and more originals on the service are really no significant. Again, that's why we're time spent number of streams. All of these things, we're getting more and more data on that. Now, that said, we're doing things differently. Again I use an example of The Good Fight that is premiered on CBS All Access is now on the CBS Network. I mean that is a high-quality show that obviously would cost a lot of money to produce, but we you can see how we're utilizing that asset. Again that's internal, but obviously we could have license The Good Fight outside of that. So we're continuously building that library value, where we have nearly 1,000 episodes of premium content that we had not yet licensed. And so again we're strategically holding that to see how this market place moves, but yet we're still putting it through our own funnel again to drive engagement. So again we, as we said in our remarks, we think we're operating in the sweet spot. We think we have the ability to continue to produce for others.\nAgain, I look at 90210 for Fox, which premiered nicely solid in the key demos great for Fox. It was only behind in total viewers to Big Brother. But it was a great show. We're doing Diary of a Female President for Disney Plus. The show is on Netflix. So we're continuously be able to do that yet we're still creating library value in the future for things we haven't yet monetize. So that's why this machine is like pushing a snowball downhill it's getting bigger and bigger.\nChris Spade\nAnd Mike, it's Chris. To that, I'd also add that it's really important, and where we are now to shows the rate for the show. So, as Joe said, in our fall schedule, we own 85%, which is more than we've had so once we own the rights. We can monetize it. And we have a lot more flexibility, which is where we want to be."]], ["On The Good Fight, that was the whole of what I wanted to ask but Joe you brought it up, can you just tell us what was the impetus to make the move? ", ["I think what we're doing is we're doing it in a case-by-case basis. Again, I don't think it's anything -- any policy that we're seeing. Again it was to basically introduce The Good Fight, which we think is a highly acclaimed show to a much broader audience. That's on the CBS Television Network. Again, that was just season one. So, if you like season one you can now catch up. So when in coming months for seasons two and three and in January, you'll have season four. So we're going to be looking at the uptick like sometimes we license shows to syndication in the drives consumption of current seasons. So again, similar type of analysis is really what we're looking for to introduce again content while again we're selling advertising against the Good Fight which rates well. It's a high quality show, so it makes sense, it's on the CBS Network. But again, it does that is expanding and we can drive a CBS All Access subscriber. That's going to be a good use of that property."]], ["And then staying on the subject of marketing, as you think about some of these new Apple plus Disney Plus some new competitors coming to the marketplace, how does your marketing strategy you have to change because I lost on nobody that you've been in the market with All Access for four years and now you're introducing Kids right as Disney comes into the market, right on top of them. ", ["Sure, Laura. Your first part about OTT, look, we offer CBS All Access and Showtime together. It's an opportunity we don't force consumers to do it. They can buy part, if they want to buy them together, we obviously discount that. We think the again those are different offerings and complementary. So we like that. So we have that available. So, I can understand why others want to kind of do that together because people will subscribe for different reasons. So like I said, we've been doing this. As you've said All Access is actually almost five-years-old. So, we've been at this. The Kids programing is really has nothing to do with Disney at all quite frankly, it has to do with the data and the research that we've done on the service, based on the consumption patterns, the average age of the viewers. So really it's that's really led us to doing this. And as you said, if you've seen all along, Laura All Access first started is really serving the super fan giving CBS some kind of catch-up viewing abilities, deep library. Then we added live linear programing to it. Then we really started producing originals and that is all based on data that we got back from our consumers. So, this is a natural progression for us. So we're going to continue to roll it out, but we've been pretty measured with the investment spend, you see that come through the P&L. But I think we've been pretty judicious about managing that and again it's all proof points along the way."]], ["But as the business gets a little bit more digital over time, do you think CBS needs to be looking more at direct response style advertising, which makes up the vast majority of the online spending? ", ["Good question. On the direct response piece of it, I don't have a concern now that we would have to go that route just based again on all the data that we have and the fact that we are America's most-watched network for the last 11 seasons. To answer it a different ways, the demand is still there in broadcast for the big advertisers and for some clients and some advertisers, they are going to migrate to digital. But I do not see the direct response replacing what we're seeing now in our ecosystem. They're always going to want that big, big breach. And then on digital, those are clients that may be going more niche, more targeted and we're doing that actually on OTT right now. I don't recall the second part of your question."]], ["So just talk about what you're doing to try to drive that business, I don't know if you'd be willing to size it for us in terms of ad revenue or what kind of growth rates you're seeing and how do you create more impressions beyond just a driving engagement?\nAnd then just to broaden out the question across direct-to-consumer maybe for yourself and Joe. ", ["I\u2019ll start on the AVOD one. I mean, obviously it is a big opportunity, it is the most premium advertising online because it is not only the power of video, but it is very targeted, and so that's what drives the higher CPMs. Going back to that 2011 to 2014 time period, where we were conceiving and building All Access in \u2013 at the same time CBSN was being built, specifically as an AVOD opportunity because we knew we need to expand that inventory, at the same time, we had this amazing opportunity using our product infrastructure and journalists to create that product.\nSo when last year you saw us come out of the gate hot, right with three more of these services with sports, entertainment and then the Roku version we have two more coming. And if you're just kind of asking me generally in the category, I definitely believe AVOD is here to stay, you have just even within All Access, as I said, two-thirds of the subscribers are choosing the limited commercial option. So even within All Access, it's a big opportunity. And then I think you will see us continue to try to press our advantage in launching into potentially more categories or more services.\nJoe Ianniello\nYes. And Ben, it\u2019s Joe. Look on your international question, look, it's a market-by-market, country-by-country analysis, the way we look at that. Obviously, we're balancing, licensing it. Our strategy here in the U.S. right was we still license it, but we didn't license it exclusively, we said exclusively except for our own services. So while our services are small, we're not really competing with them as we're building that. And so we're going to look at that. And so really what we're focused on as each countries, what is the offering, making sure it\u2019s robust to really drive the subscription.\nSo we'll continue to roll out, so that's why when we look at it and I use the metric the amount of people that are \u2013 that live outside the United States and the amount of mobile devices that they all have, as far as I'm concerned, they were all potential customers. And so we're going to need to reach them in new and improved ways with the advancements in technology. So I think that provides a lot of opportunity for us as we see how to maximize it. But it's country-by-country and franchise-by-franchise. I don't think we would \u2013 we\u2019re kind of saying anything now or in the future that we\u2019re not going to license content to third-parties because sometimes if they can pay you more money because they have a better infrastructure to monetize it, we will take that money and reinvest it back into our businesses."]], ["When you think about going to Europe and Latin America, Western Europe, Latin America with All Access, how do you think about that product strategy versus what we've seen here in the U.S., if it differs at all, particularly on the content side, because obviously you guys licensed a lot internationally.

So we don't really want to put a time line on it and then be caught up to say something is behind or not behind. We're going as quickly as possible but thorough. Again, focused on making sure that the offering to the consumer is robust, and that's really going to be what it is on content availabilities and things of that nature that\u2019s there.\nSo that's really the constraining factor, but we're committed to rolling this out in 200 countries around the world. And those are just going to be the regions where we're going to be pursuing next. But believe me the team knows how important this is. And again as I said, it's probably single-handedly the largest opportunity in front of us.\nJim Lanzone\nYes, I mean, again, obviously, I can't speak too much about the proprietary nature of our stack, but just to take you back, I mean, one of the great things, I was at an event last time with a bunch of my peers in the industry and they were kind of talking shock about this. And one of the differences with us is that going, again, all the way back to, in some cases, 15 years, our division invented a lot of SVOD normal streaming event video and things like March Madness on-demand, a lot of the big events over the years and services that we offer.\nAnd so we over time built the stack to handle what we were doing. That included, in 2013, our first Super Bowl. We've now just streamed our third Super Bowl. So by the time we did All Access, it was very natural to do it on our own stack. And now when we are launching these AVOD services, we were all right from CBSN, that team and that stack to helps the CBS Sports HQ team and their\u2019s. And look, so how we decide what to build internally, and we have a great team and a big team on that, but it was truly strategic and what's core to us, right. In some ways things like our CMF is core to us and video absolutely is.\nAnd then there are other things obviously on CDM side cloud and other certain facets of our subscription service that we will use third parties where we don\u2019t theme to be core and we just use best of breed third party. Also helps us on the cost side to keep certain parts of the variable. So we're always analyzing that.

They're seeing -- they see the returns, they see the math of it, so they see the unit economics and they're saying, well, why can't we do more?\nSo, I think we're really synced up with them on that front.

I think though the mix of games and the individual schedule works really well for the consumer.\nSo, it wouldn't surprise me at all if the same kind of paradigm existed during the next negotiation. But I do think there could potentially be increased interest in different packages by different networks. So, I hope I'm answering your question. I think we need to be flexible. I think the Sunday AFC package works really well for CBS. It aligns perfectly with a lot of our owned-and-operated stations. So, that would be the package that we would, hopefully, renew.

Bryan, thanks for the question about political. So, I said 72% twice on purpose in my comments. We did a little over $100 million in revenue for political advertising, so it was really a strong quarter and political inciting is good for CBS.\nJoseph Ianniello -- President and Acting Chief Executive Officer\nAnd Bryan on Canada, what I could say is that, I wish the country was bigger. As you know, it's a little north of 10% of the United States and it seems to be following that pattern when we launched All Access here in the States. So, that's good news. I would say though as we launched Australia in Q4, what we saw there was actually a faster pickup and I think that's because we had live local programming, because we own Network 10.\nSo, the offering in Australia is a little bit different with the live local programming and I think that's also a key part of the overall value proposition that consumers are resonating and that's why we're launching our local services here by market, because what we think the streaming services for CBSN Local again ad supported, but very valuable to the consumer engaged with the content local news, sports, weather, traffic 24/7, really is a nice value proposition from a trusted reliable brand at CBS.\nSo, we're going to continue that.

But I would say we're really still in the early innings of that.

So, for instance, we're going to have Twilight Zone here, and we can keep it on All Access or \u2013 domestically, which is \u2013 that's going to happen. Internationally, we can use it to grow our OTT business internationally, or we can license it. And so, we're going to do an analysis. It's going to be really simple. What are the offers in the marketplace for licensing, and how many subs do we think we can get in these countries? And we're going to look at that and we're going to see what's in the best interest. Because some of these things, again, as David was really alluding to, if we're not ready to capitalize on the subscription business, we might as well take the money to reinvest it and do more with it.\nAnd so, we don't have a one-size-fits-all like some of our other competitors. I think we look at it by each piece of content on what it's going to do individually. And so, we know at the end of the day, there will be more content in the CBS Showtime offerings, no question about it, but it's okay to sell our content to third parties as well.\nDavid Nevins - CBS Corp.\nI just want to point out one thing.\nJoseph R. Ianniello - CBS Corp.\nYeah.\nDavid Nevins - CBS Corp.\nTo add to what Joe was saying, what we've learned is that the more we build the tech of our own platforms and the strength and brand of our own platforms of All Access and Showtime, the more optionality we have as to where to monetize. So, to the extent that we can monetize on our own platforms, that's great, and that gives us optionality when we're making licensing decisions. And that's one of the reasons why we have been so focused these last couple years on building up our own platforms.\nDavid Bank - CBS Corp.\nOkay. Thanks, Michael. We're going to take the next question now."]], ["As you take over leadership of the company, do you see any change at the margin regarding how many series on the broadcast network you own, how many you sell to third-parties, and then how many series you, let's call it, rent from other production entities?

That said, as we sit here, more than 80% of the schedule we have ownership in. So, I don't really see it changing really dramatically from there. But again, the network has limited shelf space. The good news is for All Access, that really kind of changes the complexity, because if we have a good CBS show from our studio, we certainly can put it inside of CBS All Access. And if it's a great Warner Brothers show, we can certainly monetize it on the CBS network.\nSo, the fact that we have different outlooks I think only increases the outputs, if you will. But we definitely are in the business of putting the best shows on the network. I think that's very important. As far as local stations and acquiring them, look, I think we certainly have room within the cap. If the cap gets lifted, we have more room. As you know, we look to be opportunistic there. And so, we'll always look at it, as you just point out, is it a political market, what's the size of the market, is it an NFL market. So, if we can find some stations at values that make sense, we're always in it, in the market. But if we're not, we still get our value. And so, that's why I say it's very opportunistic. It's not like we need to own that station because we're going to get our value vis-\u00e0-vis reverse comp.\nAnd so, from our vantage point, the content is what's driving the value, but if we can own the license and have local programming in that market, it's only additive. But we're going to always look at it through that lens.\nDavid Bank - CBS Corp.\nOkay. Thanks, David. Greg, we're going to take one more question now."]], ["Are you seeing sort of a rationale to have more regular new content on All Access to drive customers sort of the way you've implement that strategy at Showtime?\nAnd then from a distribution perspective, are you thinking about bundling All Access, whether it's with Showtime, or with services like Hulu, or even thinking about working with cable operators where you might be able to work the churn levels lower? ", ["Yeah, let me deal with content first. Obviously, we're expanding the number of originals we're doing on All Access. We're expanding the number of originals we're doing on Showtime as well. Plus, we're producing for a lot more outlets. So our studios have something like 65 shows in production right now, which is a big increase from what it's done before. And when we analyze our shows, by and large, they're are profitable before we begin. So even though we're producing content for All Access and, obviously, the goal is to get our subscribers up, there is a great international play on them as well like we did with Star Trek where we got many millions of dollars for originals there. So on virtually every show, we have a strategy and we have a plan for monetizing it and there are very, very few shows we don't go into where we're not making a profit off the back. Whether it's for CBS, whether it's All Access, whether it's Showtime, or whether it's an outside service that we provide for.\nIn terms of the bundling, we're already selling All Access with Showtime OTT, so we're already doing that. And we're obviously exploring all sorts of other ways of distributing it. As you know, we're very pleased with where we are with the number of subs. And like some of the other streaming services that are bigger than us, they've made a variety of deals. We're also looking at them and we're not averse to any ideas there."]], ["With parts of the industry in turmoil, not you, agencies, the rating system, viewers changing the way they're watching, could you just talk about how different or what you're doing to change your approach to advertising in general, especially as we're going into the upfront?

And so whether you're doing that direct to the clients which more and more clients are doing that direct business, and they just want to make sure that we're delivering. So whatever the measurement system is, whatever the rules are, we're comfortable with that. Our job is to produce quality content that appeals to mass audiences. And I think when you stack us up against our competition, we stand out.\nAnd so as long as we have that and we're able to demonstrate that consumption, the monetization will follow. So clearly it's changing. I mean we're setting our sales up, organization differently. Digital advertising are clearly at higher CPMs, direct-to-consumer we're expanding the advertiser base so we're doing all of those things not to be relying on intermediaries that stop us from maximizing our revenue.\nOn the OTT front, they are at higher CPMs because they're more effective, they're more targeted. And so we have the data to support that and it's more valuable to the advertisers. So as more and more of that consumption becomes more and more acceptable to the advertisers and they see the effect, I think it just become standard.

I think I've only seen CPMs go down once in like 20 years or something like that. So the top events, the sporting events, the live events, are still going to produce huge numbers. It's still the hottest thing in town. Even as ratings go down somewhat, or appear to go down because they're watching it on different platforms or different times, network advertising is still the best game in town. That's the reason scatter is up so much, and that's the reason we're looking forward to the upfront very much."]], ["So understanding there's a mix in terms of how you guys get paid, can you talk about the mix of paid Showtime subs coming from traditional players relative to the Amazons and the other OTT players and your confidence around average rate per sub growth? ", ["Yeah, John, it's Joe. Look, I think the new distribution platforms, it's a higher ARPU for Showtime. And so that split or that business model is much better for us as more and more people subscribe that way. So again, if they switch, it's better for us. If not, we should just try to get it in the rate. And what was the second part of your question?\nLeslie Moonves - CBS Corp.\nYeah, I'll take this. There's no question that more original programming creates much less churn. The reason it's changed is Showtime's airing pattern, where we used to put on two shows or three shows per quarter. Now we will do one per month, one brand-new show per month, which has helped the churn a great deal. All Access, as you know, we've only had like two and a half shows on. That's going to be increased to seven or eight. We expect the churn to go way down on that and we're going to continue to do originals. And that's sort of a proven number."]], ["And, Les, maybe one other quick question is, look, as you know, and you talked about this, there's been a lot of concern about content pricing on the licensing side and so can you expand more on your comment in the release related to growth from renewal periods for licenses of library programming? ", ["Yeah, look, it's both domestic and international. And I think, look, it's just driven by the content that we have available and that's why we're producing more and more. We sell it and then we sell it over and over and over again. And we license it to multiple platforms. And so the windowing, John, becomes very, very important on how we window it. And so we want to be very strategic on how we're making our content available. And so that will continue as long as we keep filling the pipeline.\nLeslie Moonves - CBS Corp.\nAs we said earlier, when we have an original programming, we already have its life laid out for, whether it's over and out in 10 episodes or hopefully it turns into 150 episodes. But even in the base case, we have it worked out where we know what we're going to get internationally within a range. We know where the domestic possibilities are. And as a result, before we even greenlight anything, we basically know the range of profitability, which is why I'm able to say there are very, very few shows that lose us any money, even some that are abject failures."]], ["First, some of your peers are producing a fair amount of content to put on other companies' platforms to participate in ad share models, whether it's Facebook, or Snap, or YouTube.

We think we're going to beat or meet those. That was before we launched All Access internationally. So obviously we wouldn't have launched All Access internationally if we didn't see a lot of good data points along the way domestically.

So, as we look forward into \u201818, what I would say, it\u2019s dilutive to our margin because again obviously, we are investing in there and there is a ramp that\u2019s coming in the profitability.

And previously, there was very little competition. And then it would expand to cable and people would start going to HBO. Look, Ryan Murphy is an extraordinary talent, one of the greatest creators out there. They offered him hundreds of millions of dollars. He had to take it. But then you look a Chuck Lorre. Chuck Lorre has three shows on CBS and he also has a couple of shows over on Netflix. So, we have a lot of talent. There is a lot of room. The landscape does change.

", ["Jessica, I'll start with the OTT piece. Just on the take rate between the ad, the $6 product and the $10 product, we're seeing about 20% of our subscribers take the ad-free product. And so from a contribution margin, we're really indifferent, and that's why we priced it that way because we're basically making essentially $4 of advertising. So we're indifferent.\nBut let me be clear is that we're not managing All Access for margin. We are growing and we're making investments and putting more and more series on it because, again, the long-term ROI is very, very, very attractive, meaning, as Les just said, we just announced again The Twilight Zone coming. So we have a slate, if you will, of original series that, by the way, sometime in the future we might choose to monetize again. So obviously, that will have a lot of margin to it because the costs will be sunk. So our litmus test is, is the product that we're putting on growing subs? And as long as it continues to grow subs, we're going to feed it.\nOn your sports question, this is going to be a free ad-supported service like CBSN. So basically, what we see is an appetite of demand for consumers that want news and highlights of sports where we see a void in the marketplace, and they want it on their terms, on their time. And so we're going to give that to them. And again, we think it's attractive, but we think the demographic is very attractive for advertising. And we will tuck it in as part of All Access as well to bolster that offering in addition to CBSN, which will also be part of All Access."]], ["And perhaps any color you can share in terms of what the typical demo looks like, how much overlap you have in subscribers with your linear viewers.\nAnd then a second question, staying on CBS All Access, I think you mentioned that you're on the path to monetizing all viewing.

Obviously, the demographic, what we've noticed, it's approximately 20 years younger than our average viewer. So we are getting a younger demographic, which is really good.\nAs I said, it doesn't have to be as broad. It can be much more niche. We started out with Good Fight, which obviously brought a great deal of the female component over from CBS because it was a very female-skewing show. Star Trek is more male than female and also, as you would expect, a younger demographic as well. Star Trek will continue to expand it. We're looking. The good news about All Access, we don't care whether you're 8 or you're 80. We're bringing in people from all over the place. And different people are watching for different reasons, some to get old library product, some to get catch-up on our current series, and obviously a lot of people that are looking to see the new product. So it's very interesting, it's very exciting, and we're going to be adding new content all the time.\nJoseph R. Ianniello - CBS Corp.\nAnd, Alexia, for monetizing it, obviously we are monetizing it. But as we reach more scale, you'll see that number obviously move heavily. Again, as Les said, as the demographics are younger, we're getting away from selling demographics and selling behavior. We know if you're in the market for a car or pet food, and so the return on investment for advertisers is much higher.\nSo with that said, we still have to get millions more into CBS All Access. It's why we're making that investment to grow that. But we do see the opportunity there, but that's not \u2013 let me be clear \u2013 that's not in the Nielsen rating. And so that's where you're going to see the advertising really distinguish itself because again we are selling that on different metrics."]], ["So maybe help us understand that.\nAnd outside of the big items like Madam Secretary and NCIS: New Orleans, which we know about, is there anything else that maybe is a fourth quarter item that last year would have been in the third quarter?\nAnd then along the same lines, you mentioned the 65 shows. ", ["Yeah, Mike, it's Joe. So look, on the categories, look, in Q3 of last year we had two sales. We had a Penny Dreadful sale and a renewal of our library with Netflix. And so that occurred last year in the third quarter. That's why, again, we always say over a longer period of time you take out the lumpiness of that. Obviously, we're looking at a strong fourth quarter in content sales, because, again, Madam Secretary is done. And Les alluded to active negotiations for NCIS: New Orleans.\nLook, we look at it, and on platforms, really SVOD and cable still need the content. They still need that for ratings, for certainly basic cable. We sell them all through the broadcast television.\nSo the marketplace is there domestically, but international continues to be the best growth story that we have. Again, as we're doing that, we just sold Dynasty, which is going to be a CW show. And we're able to license product to Netflix in this case, or Amazon again.\nSo we're able to do global deals much more effectively in today's marketplace because of the global nature of some of these SVOD services. That said, is there are a lot of local SVOD players that are very competitive, and so we just want to make sure that that dynamic in the marketplace continues.\nAs far as the 65 shows goes, just to give you some context, that's up 14% just from quarter over quarter. We're doing 14% more hours, so that's an investment choice we're making, because, again, because we see the returns. So as we keep pushing this snowball downhill, as we said, we have more than 600 episodes domestically that we haven't sold, and every day that goes by it's more and more. And by the way, all this also feeds All Access as well. So you can see where you get the trifecta benefit from producing great content.\nLeslie Moonves - CBS Corp.\nYeah. And let me just add on to that. The 65 comes from \u2013 we started out, number one, Showtime, CBS, obviously producing more content for ourselves. Then you add in The CW, where either Warner or we are producing or co-producing together. Then you add in All Access, which is obviously only produced shows. And then suddenly, as you heard us mention, we're selling to 11 different services.\nWith the aftermarket being as strong as it is in terms of both domestic and international syndication, the idea of selling to all sorts of different people has become very, very lucrative, which is why virtually every time we invest in a new show, we already know it's going to be profitable from day one.\nSo when we sell a show to Turner or we sell a show to Netflix or we sell a show to anywhere, to Apple, we already know these are going to be in profit before day one of production. And that means that we're going to continue to increase that 65 number to a lot more."]], ["But given your positioning for the network in the skinny bundles and VMVPDs, can you talk about maybe to what kind of traction or growth you're seeing in the marketplace, understanding it's early? ", ["The skinny bundles, it is way too early to judge on the success or not success of what they're doing. I think the concept of skinny bundles is a smart one. It's based on the idea that people really want to pay for what they're watching and that they're paying the huge amount of money for 12 to 15 channels that they watch and they're getting 180 channels.\nSo I think they are absolutely viable. Will they all succeed? I don't know. By the way, the technology on them, they're pretty cool devices to use. And they make it easy to watch the content and watch what you want to see.\nI don't think, as I said to you, the success or failure of various skinny bundles, once again, doesn't matter to us. Because when people cut their cord, they're not going nowhere. They're going somewhere. So they either go, they're on a traditional bundle or one or two of the skinny bundles or All Access.\nSo if people are going to \u2013 we don't view people as trying to squeeze us for price, because we're going to be must-have television. Every deal that we make, we are convinced that bundles will not work without CBS on them. You've seen us make a few deals in the last few months, and I think it's proven that you can't have a complete bundle without CBS."]], ["Just following up, Joe, on your comments about those four drivers into 2018 in excess of $100 million, it does seem to be all pretty good margin increments, so it implies that you're suggesting operating income could grow mid-teens just based on that.

But again, we are investing and growing and expanding our content in the pipeline. So we're not going to get into predicting what the OI margin is going to grow by in 2018. But clearly, that's why we wanted to highlight these things that are very significant to our top line. So we'll manage that. We're managing the company to growing the top line and stuff. And so if we wanted to manage for margin, clearly, as Les said, we could have sold Star Trek to Netflix and we could have increased our margin in 2017, but we're looking at this as a long-term investment.\nSecond, on tax reform, most of our income is domestic, so we're not anticipating a whole lot of change, certainly in our book tax rate. Obviously, it's a little higher, so that would go down a little bit. But then we've got to factor in what happens with state deductions or not. So we're going to monitor this closely. We don't think it's again going to be a huge driver one way or the other for our cash flow or our GAAP earnings. But we'll stay close to this to make sure we're maximizing our after-tax cash flow whatever the rules are."]], ["We spent a lot of time talking about how many more owned shows you have in feeding the syndication pipeline, but it would also seem that that gives you a much higher degree of control, or at least visibility into programming costs, which would seem like a relative advantage in an industry where inflation continues to be the norm, as players like Netflix and Amazon keep pushing into original programming. ", ["Look, Netflix and Amazon are throwing a lot of money at a lot of product out there, and there's no question it makes the marketplace more competitive. Having said that, once again, we have been fairly diligent in that we know how to produce shows for the maximum value. Obviously, each platform has a different price point. Shows at Showtime and All Access generally cost more than shows at CBS, and shows at The CW cost somewhat less than CBS shows as well.\nBut by the same token, we take that into account. We know what our international output deals are. We know what our domestic syndication probably is. We also once again can regulate what the back-end participation is for our producers here, and there's a real upside for them for coming here versus Netflix or Amazon, where oftentimes they will be giving their rights away.\nBut every show that we do, we do ultimate. So if we are spending more like on a Star Trek, we know, A), what Netflix is going to pay for the international rights. We also know what it's going to mean to CBS All Access. Before we green-light a show on the CBS Television Network, we have an absolute based on, as I said, international output deals or international deals in general as well as the domestic potential. So as costs may go up somewhat: A), we're able to control them better; and B), we know we're going to be profitable on every single one of the shows. So the outlook for us is good, and that's why we will invest in more programming, and that 65 number very well could turn into 80 within a couple years."]], ["I was just curious how your experience with the viewership on CBS All Access may or may not impact how you view the importance of having the digital rights to the NFL in addition to the linear rights. ", ["There's no question. The NFL, as we may have told you, you may remember, we only had the last two weeks last year of the NFL season. So having it this year certainly helped the subscribers. Probably helped more by Star Trek, but having those two things both go on in September-October has certainly launched a number of subscribers. As you know, we're not giving the numbers, but it definitely has helped. And every Sunday, we do see a spike in the number of signups. So I think it's really important.\nAs we look down to the next big contract in 2022, obviously digital rights will be an important part of it. We expect that some of the larger players will be involved. But who knows, we may get all the digital rights ourselves at the same time."]], ["Are you just talking about a reduction in operating expenses, and can you put any numbers around that to help us quantify it?\nSecondly, I wanted to ask if you could provide some color on what you're seeing in the scatter market as far as pricing, demand, any comments on category strength and weakness.\nAnd then lastly, it was reported recently in the press that you're exploring a sale of Television City Studios. ", ["I'll take the last question first. TV City was formed in the 1950s. It was a production facility. It's on very valuable real estate. We're in the very preliminary stages. We have received an offer from one of the people in the neighborhood, and so we hired somebody to explore the possibility. As I said, it's very expensive real estate. It may be money that can be used better elsewhere. But it's at the very preliminary stages. I'll turn the rest to Joe.\nJoseph R. Ianniello - CBS Corp.\nAnd, Bryan, on scatter price, scatter pricing is up double digits over upfront and up double digits over scatter last year. So the demand is very strong, and it's across a broad array of categories. So we're feeling very good about the advertising climate. And so we're monetizing the ratings points or the consumption, we should say, of all the ways consumers now watch the content. So that's our focus.\nIn terms of the pension, look, it's slightly accretive because obviously there's interest cost on the borrowings offset by the premium savings on the insurance premiums. And so net-net, given where the interest rates are and the costs of what we're paying for underfunding just made no sense. So it's not going to move the needle a whole lot. It's just accretive and is why we did it now. And so it was opportunistic. We looked at it, it's a no-brainer. It reduces risk and volatility going forward, and it's at a lower cost. So it seemed like a no-brainer."]], ["But at the same time, C3 ratings have been under pressure for the industry, which has hit ad revenue a bit, and you've been talking about the leakage outside of C3 for a long time.

", ["All right. Alexia, I'll take the sports question and I'll let Joe do the tougher question. Look, as you know we already have a very proactive online sports group down in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and as I said, we have the infrastructure that allows CBSN to thrive, which obviously will be used there as well.\nWe have deals with the NFL, the NCAA, FCC football, PGA Tour Golf, lots of different areas. In addition, it's in the very preliminary stages of formation. But CBS is a big player in the sports world. We are going to look to differentiate ourselves from the ESPN and the Fox Sports as well, and we think we have a good opportunity to succeed. The other key, like CBSN, we can keep costs relatively minimal because we already have a great infrastructure for sports like we did with news. So the chances of profitability early on are very good.\nJoseph R. Ianniello - CBS Corp.\nAnd Alexia, on your OTT sub question, look, the virtual MVPDs are just getting launched. So if you go back to that Investor Day, we did lay out for you 4 million subs by 2020, and we had 8 million subs in total for Showtime and CBS All Access, kind of 4 million apiece. So that gives you some direction on what we think the size is. As we sit here today kind of a year later, we might've been too conservative in those numbers. So these services are just rolling out. They're rolling out kind of locally by market and stuff, so I think we like what we see. I think the user interface is attractive on some of these things, so I think it's going to appeal to a millennial.\nBut it's a different buyer who probably buys CBS All Access. CBS All Access, for the price point is there's no value in the marketplace for it. You're getting tons of live programming, news, sports, plus a deep library and originals for under $10. These other bundles are obviously priced $30 to $40, and it's kind of a suite of services. So we want to be in both of those, and again, we have pretty high expectations on both."]], ["So I'm curious if you can give us an update on your thought on that competitive dynamic, and whether the launch of the streaming service is another tool to help you position in that competitive market in the future?\nAnd then second, Joe, you mentioned the 54 shows compared to the 33 shows produced just two years ago. ", ["Mike, on the sports, yes, the competitive bidding is becoming more and more out there, and obviously there's digital players in the sports arena. The good news is we have the NCAA tournament till 2032, so I think we're fairly secure in the near- and far-term on that.\nIn terms of the other rights, look, the NFL has always been extremely supportive of broadcast television. Yes, there's going to be a digital component, and you're right, this service could be \u2013 allow us to be a bigger player in that and perhaps get certain digital rights as these contracts come up more and more. But once again, we have proven that broadcast is better than cable, ascertained by our NCAA ratings versus some of the cable people who have the NCAA, and I think the NFL has always stated there's a reason that the Super Bowl is always on network television. It's just higher rated, nobody has the reach that we do. There's no question that digital players will become more important, but we think they will go along with broadcast, not alone.\nJoseph R. Ianniello - CBS Corp.\nAnd Mike, for your 54 shows, yeah, that's produced across broadcast, cable, streaming services. So the economics vary, meaning the revenue we generate might vary across the board there, but so do the costs of the shows, as well. The way we look at it, Mike, it's always got to be margin-accretive. And so as it's margin-accretive, it adds to our margin and it builds our library and we monetize it around the world. So again, it's the best probably ROI we can allocate with the use of a dollar."]], ["I think that CBS as a platform, given it's in most of the skinny bundles within the ecosystem and a whole host of new virtual MVPDs as well as your CBS All Access. ", ["Okay, Vijay. It's Joe. Here's what I would tell you. First, I can confirm the reverse comp deals are \u2013 it's a flat fee. It's a license fee as opposed to tied to subscribers. And the second thing is I think when you look at it across the traditional retrans base plus the skinny bundles plus the direct OTT, we're not seeing any sub erosions here. And I think again, it's consumers find the content they want to consume, and that's really what we're seeing and that's what you can see in the numbers of growing 25% quarter after quarter is what we're posting.\nAs far as the C3/C7, we don't have specifics. We said the C7 is now the standard. The way we describe it is the vast majority of the deals. And as Les said, we're starting to get some at C35 \u2013 35-day deals, which again is also important. So I think more to come there. It's a proof point, and I think we have to show that it works. It works for an advertiser and there's true value and we will monetize it."]], ["And I think that I had positioned my question in suggesting, at least rhetorically, that there really wasn't a lot of traction with C3 at the time, and that perhaps going forward the currency would just be live and C7. ", ["No, look, going into this year's upfront, I would venture to say that 75% of the deals last year were C3. I think that has shifted a great deal to C7. By the way, it's a positive for advertisers, it's a positive for us as well that more of the people are counted. So I think going in, we had to get the top advertising agencies on board with the C7 metric, and they did. And by and large, every single one of them is there and it is the standard of the day.\nWhat is interesting, as we've talked about the total content ratings, when you get up to the C35, which is going to become even more important going forward, you see ratings going up in certain cases literally over 50%. We used The Big Bang Theory from day 2 to day 35. It was up over 50%. It went from something like 17 million viewers to 24 million viewers. So that is substantial, and that's going to mean a lot of money going forward."]], ["Is the notion that we're going into news and sports because \u2013 is that being driven by the execution of we have this big infrastructure, so now we can go get another revenue stream, or is it that you feel there's a big over-the-top bundle being created and you have entertainment lockdown? ", ["Look, obviously, CNN was doing very well, Fox News was doing very well. To begin a brand-new Cable News Network would not be smart and it also wasn't the new modern form of distribution. So it seemed logical for us to go into streaming having the infrastructure we already did in terms of news. Seeing the success we had with news, we say, all right, there's an opportunity there and sports as well. Not that other people aren't there, but our sports networks are doing extremely well online. And once again, it's a great opportunity to be all things to all people and I think we can do it successfully."]], ["And I totally understand CBS is in such a strong position versus peers given your rating strengths going into the upfront, but I guess any color how you think you might do overall in terms of where you might end up there.\nAnd then second question's really just on the local station group. ", ["Yes. Alexia, and I know I sounds like a broken record every year at this time, but the upfront to me is going to be exceedingly strong. You start hearing numbers like high singles in CPM growths, and judging by \u2013 the scatter market once again remains very strong. There's a lot of demand for our product. So we're looking at a year where we think it's going to be much better than last year, and we had a very solid year last year. So I know I'm Mr. Broadcast and I'm the cheerleader, but I got to tell you I've been right \u2013 I sound like Donald Trump \u2013 I've been right more than I've been wrong in terms of those things that are going on. And so Carnegie Hall is two weeks away. And you know me, I get a kick out of what happens there during that whole process. But we're looking towards a very strong upfront.\nJoseph R. Ianniello - CBS Corp.\nAnd, Alexia, just on your local station, look, I think we've demonstrated a very disciplined approach to M&A generally, but specifically for TV stations. So we'll always look at those opportunities. Obviously, the value of the underlying stations we own, we feel very good about. But we look at those kind of market by market specifically because our position is going in is we're going to get our value vis-\u00e0-vis the retrans negotiation or the reverse comp, because the stations need the major networks. And that's what's really driving their entire business model. So I think, again, we like to \u2013 what we say is have our cake and eat it too, because why else would you want cake if you're not going to eat it."]], ["Joe, just on these deals with YouTube TV and Hulu, you can clear the economics per subscriber accretive to your existing retrans fees, let's say, either the same or better or let's say better. ", ["Anthony, I think again, we can't get into any specifics about any of the deals, but I think you should assume there are pricing increases in all of our deals. I think the terms have to reflect the current market value we deliver, and I think we've now proven, we've been able to do this with multiple parties, not just one, not just two, not just three. So DIRECTV and Sling is ongoing. Those discussions continue, though they're complicated. They're new areas for those guys to enter into. And we're engaged and we'll see if we can come to a meeting of the minds on all deal terms. But it's complicated.\nSo, but we're very encouraged with the new entrants in the marketplace and it seems to really be working, but we're again, as Les said, for a bundle \u2013 a skinny bundle to truly be successful, not to have the number one network with sports, entertainment, news.

The numbers between C3 and C7 are quite large, and they're growing larger every day as people get more and more choices and doing that. So the numbers that will come into the marketplace will be much higher, and this will be sound money. Basically, advertisers have been sort of getting those days for free in a lot of cases, and that's just not fair unless you're a movie company that is really time sensitive on what you're doing.\nSo, I think the shift to that will bring new dollars into the marketplace, and certainly it will mean we will be counted more. There will be more viewers counted, and then you get beyond that, beyond C7, we have talked about, you know, dynamic ad insertion. Those numbers are growing quite a bit too literally where maybe beyond C7 you get 15%, 20% more viewers, which is another area of potential great growth coming up for us. So the idea is to capture all this, and I think it bodes well for the future.\nJoseph R. Ianniello - CBS Corp.\nAnd, Mike, on the 20% more hours, obviously, look, we're doing more for CBS, CW, Showtime, as well as All Access. So first, obviously, we want to fill up the pipe as much as we can with our own content. But beyond that, again, we have the capacity to produce for others. And so that's good, they're all going to be profitable for us. So the theory being is the more and more stuff, intellectual property you own, it gives us licensing opportunities, it gives us subscription opportunities, and it gives us advertising opportunities, the three revenue types that drive our future. So it is the best ROI we can have, and so that's what the fuel is and that's why we always say first and foremost we're going to continue to invest in content."]], ["And where do you think the market is in terms of the shift of demand from digital back to TV?\nAnd then for Les, on the programming front, your renewal rate of the primetime lineup has improved over the past couple of years, particularly for new shows and much better than peers. ", ["John, it's Joe. I'll go first. On your question about advertising, I think yes. I think, look, I think you're seeing different tiering packages going on at subs, so for cable nets. And I think the reach will separate the men from the boys, as Les said in his prepared remarks. And again, I think we stand out even more than that. And so I do think there will be a shift of those dollars on where they go to find those eyeballs because again, we'll have more reach just based on the distribution platform of that.\nAnd when you start talking about digital, I think obviously that will be competitive with cable. But compared to us, there's obviously going to be a shift, a flight to quality is what the way we like to say it. You know what you're going to get when you have an ad on CBS's schedule. It's that strength and stability, so advertisers should pay a premium for that. And so I think we're seeing lots of instances where I think people are absolutely shifting. We're not saying they're doing it and cutting digital entirely, but clearly a shift of the mix between digital and re-looking at that allocation, if you will, gives us a big opportunity from where we sit.\nLeslie Moonves - CBS Corp.\nJohn, I've been doing scheduling a long time, and it gives me an advantage of not only looking at this season but looking two, three years out in advance. And this year, you're right. We did less pilots because we picked up 18 shows that are coming back. And that stability allows us to do fewer pilots than most of our competitors, and also target those pilots. In other words, these pilots we sort of know going in where they might go, what could happen with them. Obviously some of them don't work. Some of them are terrible.\nBut the good news is I know right now we have enough to \u2013 we're going to be in very good shape come two weeks from yesterday in Carnegie Hall. The planning process has been helpful, knowing what we know, the fact that we picked up those shows a couple of months ago gave us a very good head start and it also, as I said, targeted our pilots. So we only did eight dramas and eight comedies, which is a few less than we normally do. And, as a result, we've been able to control costs in addition to our returning shows, we're able to control costs on them as well by adding or subtracting certain elements to the show."]], ["So one of the things you said in your prepared remarks, Les, is that you're ahead of the 8 million combined subs by 2020, and at the same moment you announced that you're going to bundle together for the first time Showtime OTT and CBS All Access.

And, Laura, I would just add, obviously you talk about churn. That's what you've got to think. It reduces churn. So it's really, again, we're looking at net effective, not just the consumer who just comes and then leaves. We're looking that as a longer term where there's something in it for everybody, so you stay longer with the package.

They'll be very welcomed. I'll have Rupert up on stage with me. It'll be fine. So it won't affect us at all. We have never blocked a station sale from going through. We have negotiated when we had the opportunity, when some of the contracts said they had to negotiate. Although those usually aren't in contracts anymore because of what the marketplace is.\nBut we deal with affiliates across the board and if we continue to do what we're doing, we see how much money stations are making, we know they are delivering back to us part of that money that they're getting in retrans, in reverse comp, but we also know they're dealing with great margins because of us.

Then they realized that because, in many cases on banks parts of the population, they end up developing wallets and they started off with having them be in essence a closed loop network that is within their world. And then as they become bigger and we end up having discussions with them, they realized that we could bring a lot of things to them in terms of our global reach, cross-border capabilities, the ability to provide products that could be used to purchase in e-commerce, capabilities to increased security like tokenization.\nAnd them, by the way, can help us grow by being both a issuer and acquirer for us.

And the reality is that many of these new players that are coming into the marketplace are attracting new segments of the market and they are bringing new capabilities that are accelerating the growth of digital payments and the acceleration of moving from cash and check to digital forms of payments. In many cases, we in fact are opening up the capability for our existing traditional clients to get their credentials involved in places that they probably otherwise wouldn't have been able to get them, but for us forming partnerships with some of these new types of players.\nSo I think in many of the cases, it becomes additive for everybody in the payment system. It becomes additive for our traditional bank partners. It becomes additive for the fintech or the wallet or the neobank player and it becomes additive for Visa. So it is something that we certainly remain focused on it, but it's all about growing the industry for all of the players in the ecosystem.\nVasant Prabhu\nSo Ramsey, I mean, from our standpoint, the question you raise is a question we talk about all the time. This is a business built on partnerships. This is a business where partnerships are very much, as I said in my comments, a force multiplier. In every situation, we have a very explicit conversation around things that we partner to do and things that we should do ourselves. And to the extent that it is a channel conflict question, we very clearly steer clear of those areas. And so when we have those kinds of issues, we typically partner and where we don't, that's when you might find us actually offering the service ourselves."]], ["And there has been questions around macro trends and potentially slower cross-border, just globally in September, October from different parts of the ecosystem and just doesn't look like you are seeing that. ", ["Yes. On the second question, yes. I mean the full impact of pricing is visible in the second half and it is definitely visible on the international revenues line. It also is the case that some of it was muted in the third quarter because as you know that line also includes some of our exchange FX revenues and the third quarter had some of the lowest volatility in five years. And the fourth quarter saw some improvement. Volatility was still lower relatively speaking, but it was improved from the third quarter. So the benefits of pricing, which were largely washed out by low volatilities in the third quarter, were more visible in the fourth quarter. But you are right that pricing is showing up in that international revenues line.\nIn terms of your first question on cross-border trends. Cross-border trends, as I indicated, were pretty good all over the place. We highlighted some areas where they were stronger like CEMEA, like Southeast Asia. Inbound into Europe has stayed strong for quite a while in the mid-teens. This excludes what we call the intra-Europe cross-border transactions. Inbound to the U.S., which is a sizable business for us, improved a bit, but it's still quite weak. So the strong dollar is certainly holding down inbound to the U.S.\nThere were spots of weakness, as you might expect, like inbound to Hong Kong. In fact, both in and outbound to Hong Kong. But by and large, we saw good improvement in Latin America, good improvement in parts of Asia. Certainly strong inbound to Europe. So no real indication that there is any change in trend. I think there was, we said there was some slowdown in travel, but it was more than made up for improvements in e-commerce. So I would say stable to improving is probably the best way to describe it.\nMike Milotich\nNext question?"]], ["Just on the new payment flows, I guess is there a way, can you comment on like the percentage of your business or way to track the addition to your growth that would come from new payment flows, whether it's B2B or Visa Direct. ", ["So Bob, I gave you a little bit of insight in my remarks, I would say. We are over $1 trillion. So I said in my remarks that we had just under $9 trillion of payment commerce that ran over our network. Of that, we were over $1 trillion in B2B. So it's about 12% of our volume. We know in the carded B2B part of the world, we are still the market leader in the United States globally and in most markets.\nWe also gave a little bit of insight in Visa Direct. We said that we grew in triple digits and we reached the two billion transaction mark. So both of those are pretty substantive. B2B being in the 12% area of all of our volume and Visa Direct getting to the point where it's two billion transactions. So these are not kind of experimental or in any way, shape or form in any kind of pilot mode at this point. These are kind of full-fledged new payment flows that we are continuing to invest in and we will continue to grow around the world and they have reached a point where obviously they are substantive contributors to our revenue and our profit.\nIn the case of contactless, obviously we are very excited about getting to the point where the U.S. starts to scale up as it relates to contactless. I think getting now past the 100 million card mark and getting 80% of, the top issuers involved and at the same time getting a large part of the merchant network out there plump for tap-to-pay, I think that there is going to be a great opportunity to see growth. And what we have seen in the markets that are more mature in tap-to-pay that there is a spillover effect in terms of people who are tapping to pay start to increase their volume overall and we are going to continue to push.\nOne of the, what we think is a very, very important use case related to tap-to-pay, which is urban mobility projects particularly focused on mass transit systems. Just in the last quarter, we launched contactless travel in Edinburgh, Scotland, Rome, Sao Paulo. And now we have added 60 new metro areas, transit systems to our tap-to-pay network. And we have got a 180 or so other live projects going on around the world. So I see a combination of driving, what I think is one of the great use cases, transit and continuing to roll out tap-to-pay around the world with a particular emphasis on the U.S. since it's been so far behind.\nAnd in the U.S., as you might know, in the New York subway system we have it up and going in a pilot. I think it's 70 stops on four, five, six line from Grand Central Station to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. And in September, we launched it at the beginning of June and in September we have reached a million taps. And that's pretty incredible, given the fact that we are still in the very early stages of rolling out the tap-to-pay card.\nSo I feel good about the progress. But the last point I would make, Bob, is it typically takes the most time to get to the first 5% to 10% penetration in tap-to-pay. And then the growth rate starts to accelerate from there. And we are in the 2% to 3% point in the United States. So we are still in that more formative building stage. But I think by the end of 2020, if we hit the 300 million contactless cards and the MTA as one example rolls it out to their, I think it's like 270 subway stations, I think we are going to see a real acceleration in the momentum of the growth.\nMike Milotich\nJordan, we will take one last question."]], ["I guess Michael or Steve -- I know you're not going to provide a lot of details around some of the big pending leases at Farley and PENN2 but can you just kind of help frame some of the discussions and the timing?

We have many leases that are still below market. We have obviously some that are above market, depends on what the advantage of those leases were. And obviously windows leads this role. Can't predict where the market will be at that time, but in some cases, the asset and maybe a better year. So Topshop, SOHO, that was entirely retail. And, today the best answer may be that, the ground floor space is retail and the upper floor has become office and income is, not that different.\nThat office space with the Crosby street address we think is going to be very attractive and we have interest already.

Haim Chera is a rainmaker, okay? Now we have experienced with rainmakers. I recruited Mike Fascitelli 20-odd years ago from Goldman Sachs. He was -- that worked out. He was a rainmaker. That worked out great, okay? We put together the JBG Smith business where basically -- if you want to look at it this way, we basically recruited Matt Kelly and his team in the rainmaking business to take at shepherd our assets and that worked out better than great.\nBy the way, just as an aside there -- when we did all that everybody thought that Crystal City was a drag. Nobody had any confidence in it except Matt Kelly. So now we have two people we have confidence in: Matt Kelly and Mr. Amazon. So we're doing great down there. And so Haim is in the -- follows in the successes of rainmakers. I've been trying to get him for years and years. And why do we need him? Number one we have $7 billion-odd or $8 billion I don't know the exact number of retail assets on our balance sheet. Now they deserve the most aggressive best most talented management that's a lot of capital and we and those assets need to be what's the word? Those assets need to be shepherded and cared for with the highest talent.\nThe second is, is that we think that the disruption that is in process now I don't know what inning we're in but we'll get worse and worse in the retail industry going forward will present enormous opportunities as I've said multiple times with those who have both talented capital. You have to have both to be able to play. So we're just getting ready for that and the retail is a business that we've been in all our lives. It's a business that we consider ourselves in experts in. We consider Haim Chera to be even more expert than we are. So this is not a business that we're exiting. We're not afraid of it. We think we are running full. We will run full tilt into the fire and we think that the opportunities are going to be quite extraordinary."]], ["And I guess the follow-up question kind of a two-parter but could you or Glen or Michael maybe just talk a little bit about the demand at Farley and how you see that unfolding and maybe the timetable behind that?

For example, when the patent office moved out and what was it, the BRAC when we had all of that dislocation in Washington, better part of 10 years ago, we did guide for that because we thought it was something that was very difficult to predict that everybody was focused on.\nLast year, we did guide to what the minimum the retail cash NOI would be and I'm happy to say we missed it by $20 million to the positive side. So having said that, so we will think about your question because it's a valid question. I will tell you one thing. I for one as an operator don't understand how folks think about this. When we empty out a slug of space that's paying us $55 a foot to transform the building and two years later or 18 months later, we let that space for $90 a foot, we think that that's a huge asset and that's a very important part of our business and our colleagues as well.\nSo whereas - what I'm really saying is that I wish you folks would look upon the fact that we are going to kick out $50 tenants and move in $90 tenants as a huge uptick in shareholder value.

I think after a pause coming in the year, there's a number of things that are hitting the market. Some new product like the condo, interested 30, Hudson Yards, you've got some other, call it, Midtown buildings, maybe lesser quality coming out on Lex, but I think the sweet-spot is going to continue to be that under $300 million to $400 million size, where a lot of the deals were last year. But we also have some bigger deals coming out, whether it's a couple of things that SL Green is putting out or some of the other assets in the Garment District.\nSo it looks like near-term, there's probably $5 billion to $6 billion of office product that is recently hit or will hit in the next 30 days. I think it's probably higher quality than what we saw for the bulk of last year and we'll see how it plays out, but I think the investor interest, at least from what we're seeing, hearing, is active and I think you're starting to see investors perceive value in Midtown as well, just sort of on a price per square foot standpoint, where most of the assets are trading for $1,000 a foot or less, which is, as we're seeing now, is some of the new builds that are going out at $2,000 a foot or north. That's a pretty attractive basis. So the market feels like it's picking up in terms of quality and I think we'll see investor interest reflect that.\nSteven Roth\nI would put my $0.02 and I agree with what Michael said. I think the first thing is that buildings have been pricing now at $1,000 a foot in that neighborhood a pinch more or a pinch less for years now. The investing marketplace has gotten used to that number and considers it to be fair value as I do. So there is no sticker shock and people are getting used to the pricing of what first-class Manhattan office buildings trade for. So I think that there is a very deep market of investors who want to invest in New York.\nI think it's basically the strongest market in the world. We know what's going on in London, we know what's going on in Europe. I mean, Tokyo is doing great, that's a whole different kettle of fish. So what I'm saying is we think New York gets way more than its fair share. We think pricing - investors are used to the pricing and we're anticipating a strong investment sales market next year."]], ["Just on street retail, given what we saw happen with rents in 2018, do you guys have any thoughts on where you could see street retail rents bottom and start to inflect positively?

With respect to rents, the biggest problem on rents are that there are fewer tenants trolling the marketplace looking for space. So we don't yet know what the bottom price is.\nIf you follow this market as most other markets, it will take a while, maybe a year, maybe two years for some of these vacancies to be cleaned up by bottom fishers and then the market will level and start to grow again.

What we're seeing is that in the better buildings in the better submarkets, there is robust demand, and in fact even increasing rents. If you are not in the right submarkets, or if you have tired buildings, you are seeing a totally different New York, but the New York that we operate in looks very robust to us.\nDavid, what do you think?\nDavid Greenbaum\nJamie, I'll give you one statistic that I find interesting, and that is year-to-date in New York we have leased little less than 1.4 million square feet, 1.347 million. Of that, 600 plus thousand square feet was all growth by existing tenants; it's Facebook, it's NYU Langone, it's HomeAdvisor, it's AlixPartners. So we are still seeing tenants increasing their footprints, looking for more space. As I was coming upstairs for this call, I heard Glen and one of his leasing guys, talking about the actions that they've got in terms of proposals that we're working on for our building.

So the essential part of New York is it's an enormous infrastructure of talent, headquarters, business, arts, restaurants et cetera. I would be remiss, if I don't mention theater because that's my family business. And the inflow of talent into New York continues unabated and we watch it very carefully. People want to be in New York, they want to be in the right spot. And so, we think that New York continues to have an enormous future.

John, the profit on 220 will fall through FFO on it's non-depreciable real estate and accordingly under the NARIET definition of FFO, the gains on the sale of that land parcel is now fully developed, will show up in FFO. We're going to treat it as not part of recurring FFO but only as part of FFO as adjusted because it's not recurring but there will be a billion dollars of income flowing through the income statement and a billion dollars of cash generated.

Now that rent is not one and the reason I say the rent is not one because the landlords aren't totally stupid. Our business is keeping, keeping the income coming in and keeping our spaces full. So you can be sure that universally across the city at all properties, the rents will go to the clearing price to fill up the space, so that will happen because market dynamics not because of a misguided piece of legislation. I would remind you that we're on the same side because the most important drivers of the financial health of the city are individual income taxes and property tax, so that's what I think. I think I'm sensitive to the issue. And I think getting these stores for reoccupied is important for the health of the city, but I think this legislation is misguided."]], ["Just last thing, some of your peers, especially in New York City have called for a midtown -- have called for a rebound in midtown rents maybe during the next 6 to 9 months.

What we're seeing is that space is getting tight, the economy is very strong, people want to expand and there is activity in the traditional midtown market, but it is nowhere near as vibrant as the West Side market. What's more, we're looking over our shoulder at the new supply that is coming to the -- as a result of that West Side Hudson Yards, Manhattan West developments sucking million of feet out of the traditional midtown market. So it's difficult to understand what that will do. There are some folks who think that job growth absorb that space. That may be a little bit aggressive but over time, certainly it will be. So what we're saying is that we're 100% leased in our midtown assets but the growth that we are realizing, the extraordinary growth comes from the West Side.\nDavid Greenbaum\nWe can get back, Vikram to the--\nSteven Roth\nWhat's the number?\nJoseph Macnow\n20.

On those, most of [indiscernible] will be flat, and a couple cases there'll be some rolls down what have been some very, very high rents. As we look out into '19 and the future, we remain very optimistic in terms of the spreads that we can achieve on the portfolio."]], ["Steve, I was wondering if you could talk about Penn Plaza, the promise land as you noted in your churns later, but talk about from a perspective of the potential capital overtime to develop and redevelopment, the developed, against the backdrop of your comments that the public market has been more challenged from a realty perspective and hasn\u2019t grown a lot of people want to invest in private relative to public. ", ["So, first of all, Vornado has been rewarded for its contrary and early investment in Penn Plaza enormously. Our basis and most of the assets in Penn Plaza when I am talking about millions and millions of feet is about $200 a foot, and I don't know what the buildings would sell for today, pick a number, say 900 hours a foot, you all can do the multiplication, $700 a foot times all that square footage is an enormous value creation. That's the first thing.\nThe second is that Penn plaza had always been years ago the cheapest submarket in town. That's going to change and it's going to change monumentally, but the timing of Penn Plaza was not yesterday, was not the day before. It's really now and the day after today. And by that I mean, Penn Plaza is right and lots of different ways, right for rent growth, its right for tenant demand, it' right for tenant demand now.\nWe have plans that we've already announced to spend 200 million on one Penn Plaza, which we have already announced. We believe will drive market rents up $20 a foot. So $20 a foot that's overtime, but the leases turnover over the five years cycle in one Penn Plaza or as David calls it now Penn One, so if you take a look at the math to $20 a foot kind of just 2.5 million -- 2.6 million square foot building is roughly $50 million and $50 million you can value.\nLet net $200 to accomplish the transformation of the building that's a $4 a share increase in value, okay. On a $200 million invest at the increment. Obviously $200 million is an investment that Vornado can handle very, very easily with the no capital raise, no selling shares, no dilution and no partners. On Two Penn, we have various different plans, but it looks like we\u2019re going to go to Plan B.\nNow let\u2019s talk about that for a second. I think you could characterize, Penn Station, now I am talking about the underground now. We are on the over ground but not the underground obviously. So, the underground of Penn Station is probably -- Joe, what\u2019s the good word, reviled? That's too tough, told you about. Okay. So, the Penn Station is probably one of the most disrespected pieces of infrastructure, for something that is the most important and busiest transportation hub in North America.\nSo from aesthetic point of view and operational point of view what have you -- it's not something that we are proud of, okay, but not something that the community is proud of, okay. So 10 years ago as you might remember, Vornado, the related companies at Madison Square Garden all got together and actually we signed agreement. So this was not a dream, this was a reality, a potential reality.\nSo move Madison Square Garden to the Farley Building which wouldn't allow for a total transformation of the -- which with daylight the station remove the building that was on top of it and allow for a total transformation of Penn Station in every way that would be -- that would have been the government's responsibility.\nNow, we invested years in that plan when it became pretty obvious that a public sector, was not going to get -- was not going to be able to do it or get their act together that plan dissolved. Now while we were working on that plan, we were the subject of a fair amount of community criticism, it was a landmark that the Farley Building was a landmark building, lots of other things that is not necessarily go into, all of which were very small and I might even say penny, okay.\nWhen the proposal was withdrawn and it wouldn\u2019t happen, the amount of remorse on the part of the entire community, government officials, the New York Times et cetera was astonishing, okay. Now fast-forward to today, Vornado has initiated a plan which granted is a very ambitious to basically, I said in my letter and I assume this is one of the things you're interested in, to raise the tick down Penn Two, tick down Two Penn Plaza and build that unlike the 5 million square feet of air rights that are trapped on top of Madison Square Garden, daylight the Train station and build a very significant maybe even two large buildings.\nThat would involve at the increment of -- incremental taxes, real estate taxes, et cetera which would have allowed a pirate to be created, which is a financing scheme, which would have given the government a very substantial amount of money, billions of dollars to transform Penn station, okay. It looks as if, now one of the things that we needed was we needed some help as you could imagine because it was a fairly massive undertaking and an enormous public good. It does not appear that that plan is going to go forward or that it\u2019s feasible for lots of different reasons although we are ready and willing to do it.\nSo if that\u2019s the case and if that land is not going to go forward, we are going to go quickly to Plan B. Plan B is taking Penn Two, which is a 1.6 million square foot building, skinning it, putting on a new skin which will allow for basically floor to ceiling glass, et cetera. New lobbies, entirely new arrival, new mechanical systems, et cetera, plus adding how many feet, David?\nDavid Greenbaum\nBetter part of 300,000 square feet.\nSteven Roth\nPlus adding the better part of 300,000 square feet in a bustle, which would sort of like a doughnut encompassed the lower floors of that building, okay. That is a much more modest proposal than we had that I just talked about. And it's -- we're going to go to it and we're going to go to it quickly. That will involve a sum of money we haven\u2019t even announced yet the plans -- the capital spend or the returns for that on that -- but they are certainly well within the ability of Vornado to finance, totally off our balance sheet today with, no dilution, no investors, et cetera. And so that will also be a plan that will start in a couple of years, I guess, and finish in a couple of more years."]], ["What do you sort of think that rollover would sort of look like on the balance of lease income to this year and maybe in the 2019 and how people sort of think through sort of the downside or maybe we're getting closer to bottom here? ", ["The only thing that matters is three things, Steve. Number one, the locations that we have and the quality of this retail is the best in the world. There will always be a Fifth Avenue. There will always be a Time Square, okay. The second thing is that our income is protected by long-term leases on our Fifth Avenue and our Time Square property from high quality tenants. And the third is that, we have said repeatedly that our projections show and we are guiding that our income will not go below $304 million cash from retail. So, there's going to be people going out, people coming in and that's the bottom that I see, okay. With respect to the details of it, I'm not a position to give you that."]], ["Okay, and then just on the non-core sales and maybe two quarters ago you outlined a bunch of non-core assets that you would start to look to sell, would generate an excess of billion dollars.

The remainder of that those assets are either public securities that we have chosen not to execute on or that have time delays such as assets, such as loans which have the maturity data at the end of this year or at the end of next year or whatever, or something like Lexington -- not Lexington, NAREIT, which we have tax protection as you probably all know. So, we are in the market and half of those and it's going to be slower going. This is not just a single trade. So, we expect that cash to come in over the next year or two."]], ["In the shareholder letter than again earlier Steve you talked about the potential ground-up development at Two Penn Plaza using transferred air rights, which sounds like maybe that\u2019s the likely scenario at this point. ", ["The air rights on Two Penn Plaza and Madison Square Garden are a single tax swap, in fact when you go into Madison Square Garden we manufactured the chilled water for their air conditioning system, so, we\u2019re compadres. When the original deal was created and I say this sort of carefully, the original grand Limestone Penn Station was torn down, which by the way as we all know was the reason that\u2019s the landmark laws were instituted in New York in any event.\nSo at that point, there was an agreement to split the air rights on that block and that agreement has been modified a couple of times over the years and it still exists. So we owned the air rights together with Madison Square Garden and a proportion that is something we\u2019re not going to get into today, but it's not -- totally not totally even but it's not that far from even. But in addition there are -- those air rights are qualified for a transit bonus which consist probably about 1.5 million, 2 million square feet otherwise little over 2 I think.\nDavid Greenbaum\nLittle over 2 million.\nSteven Roth\nSo basically of the 5 million square feet of air rights that I speak about, 3 million of them are owned by Lee and Madison Square Garden. And then 2 million of them would come by virtue of transit bonuses, which would have a modest cost because the private party puts up the money to improve the transit in the neighborhood. So that\u2019s the math."]], ["Steve in your comments you talked about $1 billion of assets to be sold and I know that at least one or two quarters ago you identified another bucket of $1 billion of assets including some of the stakes you have in public companies.

So this is in a way of clean up and so that is - as I said this will take a couple of years to liquidate those assets.\nSo in addition, as I said in my remarks at 220 Central Park South as closings begin in 2019, we expect that also to augment our cash balances for the year definitely."]], ["And I guess as a follow-up maybe to Michael's question about you know kind how to deploy capital with the stock down in the kind of mid 60s here and your NAV at 96.

So a buyback now would be accretive to NAV by a relatively smallish number but it would, it would - basically require reducing our balance sheet by a fairly significant number.\nSo for example, if we did a buyback of $500 million or a $1 billion that cash is gone and you get an accretion to the NAV of you know a number which is say a $1 a share give or take a little bit. So currently our board basically believes that we'd rather keep that keep that $1 billion of dry powder than increase it a very marginal amount though. Increase our NAV by a marginal amount.

And I think we our folks have taken those into account as they created their plan and their guidance for 2020."]], ["And then based on your guidance for your downstream business for 2020, it's a touch below what you thought actually, coming into 2019 initially, just given some of the project delays you saw last year and frankly a more manageable liquid asphalt price environment. ", ["Yeah. I think what we see is real strength in unit margin improvement in asphalt and up double-digit. We're calling for liquid being flat to slightly down. And our volumes are just up slightly. And the -- that again will be determined by the timing of this DOT work and how fast it gets started.\nYou got to remember we had two -- we had big projects in asphalt in Tennessee and we had the big 202 project in Arizona, which neither one of those were repeating going into 2020. So, they were windfalls in 2019, they are not going to repeat, even with that we're seeing slight improvements in volume and so that get much bigger -- they'll have to accelerate work is in some of the lettings that I talked about."]], ["And then just a question on the 2020 guidance, there is about 700 basis points of differential in the high and low end as it relates to the year in your growth. ", ["I think -- I would tell you is probably going to be mostly volume. I go back to timing of shipments, I go back to do we get -- do you get hit with the tropical storm or two or three. Those would be the big variables, so I think between the high end and the low end and how it lines up would be the delta.\nSuzanne Wood\nThat's right. And that's a very similar approach to what we took at the beginning of 2019 when we gave the volume guidance then, a range of 3% to 5%. And luckily and happily we wound up being ahead of that for the year. But Tom is right, it really comes down to what happens with the timing, it's shipments and weather as to whether you're at the lower end or the higher end. And as Tom said, we'll continue to watch with interest how residential -- how those starts, continue to improve throughout the year."]], ["So I guess, just to be - to just want some clarification of whether it doesn't seem from the outside that there's anything that would produce that type of outcome, given volume and price, but is there anything you're seeing there? ", ["I think I'll comment on the market and then let Suzanne comment on the financials. The works there, I think we feel good about our backlogs and our booking pace and we support our outlook, both for the full year and for 2020. But as always, in the fourth quarter, it's just a matter of how many shipping days you're going to have before the year is out. I think you saw that last year. We actually ran out of time when we pull work into the first quarter of 2019. So it's first in - first - fourth quarter and first quarter are always just iffy because of the time of year it is. But the underlying fundamentals, the pricing, the demand, all those fundamentals are there, and we feel very good about it.\nSuzanne Wood\nYes. And I would just add on to that, that's the guide that's been in place all year. We're still comfortable within that range, as you indicated. Hopefully, at the - at/or around the midpoint of the range, but it depends on the number of shipping days. So I wouldn't - I would not read anything into the fact that we didn't raise the lower end of the range. We just decided to leave it in place, but nothing in our outlook for the year has changed. And indeed, if you look at the results that we have produced year-to-date, I mean, we are on a good pathway to achieve that."]], ["Are you seeing anything in the second half of the year, be it labor, whatever it would be that would be pause for concern in terms of what's going to happen on the pricing environment?\nAnd then kind of as a corollary to that, you've done a nice job of putting a lot of growth CapEx and cost reduction at the quarry level and at the distribution level. ", ["Yeah, I think you saw a very good performance in cost in the second quarter. Our total cost of sales was up 2% in spite of wet weather through a number of our states, which really eats up operating efficiencies. So we overcame that. The biggest driver of the increase is, you heard Suzanne say the second quarter was stripping in anticipation of sales volume growth. So I'll take that problem all the time.\nWe saw good improvements on operating efficiencies and the things that drive our cost. Our folks are very focused on this, more to come. I can't tell you how focus our operators are on improving their operating efficiencies that really drive the cost.\nBut based on our performance in Q2, they are winning. This is so important as you know, because it's a big driver of those unit margins and being able to take that incremental revenue to the bottom line. So as I would describe the rest of the year, more to come and I would expect us to keep improving our operating efficiencies."]], ["And I'm wondering, is there anything structurally different in this cycle compared to the past, because when we're looking at 8% gross margins in a business that has about 8% SG&A to sales.\nThat's not a fantastic profit contribution even with a great flow through that you're getting in aggregates. ", ["Well, I think the simple answer is no, there's nothing structural change in Asphalt. This is a function liquid pricing and cost. And I think you're seeing a turn there. Overall, we are seeing profitability in the Asphalt product line improving both in volume and unit profitability.\nYou saw that in Q2 with volumes up 8%. And that was both volumes were up in spite of wet weather in Tennessee, Texas and California, where -- some of our biggest asphalt states.\nLiquid costs were up $11 million. However, gross profit per ton was flat. This stopped a six quarter run of shrinking unit margin in asphalt, due to liquids prices spiking. That levelled off as you remember -- fourth quarter to first quarter, and it's been pretty much flat through the first half.\nLooking ahead, I would expect unit margins to be on the rise as asphalt prices are rising and liquid prices has stabilized. If you step back and look at the full year, I would maybe expect us to end up a little on the lower end of guidance in asphalt.\nAnd that's really a function of wet weather in the first half of the year. We just had so much rain in Tennessee, Texas and California that we don't know that we'll have enough shipping days to get the volume, we expected before the end of the year. Now that being said, our backlogs are very good. Our lettings are growing and the unit margins are growing.\nSo between rising unit margins, big backlogs, a dramatic increase in how we're funding and lettings in Vulcan states, this product line has a very bright future.\nSuzanne Wood\nAnd I would add to that with respect to the guidance for the remainder of the year, Tom's right, you know we're just being a bit cautious in evaluating the number of shipping days we have left and the ability of our contractors to perform all of that work in a very compressed timeframe.\nIf you go back to the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year for the non-aggregates segment, which is asphalt, as well as Concrete and Calcium, we said that we expected that to grow year-over-year the gross profit by 15% to 20%. We now think that that gross profit year-over-year growth will probably be toward the lower end of that, at about 15%. Again, being a little bit cautious on that. And I think that in terms of consensus, most of the consensus is at about 15% anyway."]], ["It looks like you have good cost control, you have volumes to support the fixed cost absorption, pricing in the mid-single digit range, you've got you're stripping out of the way this quarter. ", ["I think, we -- first of all, let me if I misspoke on stripping, I didn't mean to -- the stripping is not out of the way. That will continue through the year because of demand and what we see coming with particularly with the highway demand. So stripping costs will stay up for a while, and I would expect them to stay up, I know they stay up between for at least the next six months. Again, that's a good thing because it's anticipating big volume growth driven by public demand.\nI think, we hate sound like a broken record, but we're going to take you always back to 60, not the good things can't lineup in a row for a while to get you above 60. But we point out well you have a lot of tailwinds. This is -- this sport is played outside, there is a lot of things that can happen and to offset just the tailwinds. You're not going to have them, you're going to get -- you're going to get some things that are going to challenge you along with the good stuff. So just from experience, can you have a period at above 60? Yes. Can you have a period of below 60? Yes. But I think, we'd always bring you back to 60."]], ["And I'm curious, if you could speak to some of the efficiencies of profitability you're seeing in some of the long-haul markets, either through your vessels and container road or the rail networks and also a little more on that, we've been hearing about some moderation in transportation costs. ", ["I think first of all, the cost I'm referring to is our actual operating costs, not transportation. It's actually the cost to produce and sell rock taking the logistics -- taking most logistics out of that. So I'm really referring to our total cost of sales to produce stone, ex-transportation.\nGoing to your transportation question, we are seeing rising costs for long-haul transportation, particularly by rail. As you know, this is a spike, but it's real this year. The Mississippi River and the river transportation costs have been delayed and higher due to flooding. So, I would tell you that particularly long-haul transportation, we continue to see it escalate not go down, no level it is actually going up at a pretty good path."]], ["One of the things that we've heard or you have spoken about in the past is higher transportation cost generally enhance the economic moat of the Aggregates business, but is there the potential that moderating costs could actually potentially open up some more competition in pressure pricing? ", ["I think first of all, the cost I'm referring to is our actual operating costs, not transportation. It's actually the cost to produce and sell rock taking the logistics -- taking most logistics out of that.

", ["I would tell you that the short answer to your question is yes. I think that our folks are doing a good job, as I said earlier, executing on those operating disciplines that drive cost and the efficiency with that. I think it's important this that you take that cost and take it to unit margins. We saw unit margins in the second quarter up 11% to $5.34. We've now put together three quarters in a row with double-digit unit margin improvement, and that is a combination of solid pricing, but very good operating execution. And it's not about spending money. It's really about the execution of the operating disciplines that drive costs.\nSo, you heard me thank our folks, the men and women at Vulcan that drive those unit margins, I'd like to do that again, because they are now consistently turning in double-digit improvements in gross profit per ton. So, I would expect us to continue our operating disciplines and the cost to follow."]], ["So, as we're kind of looking at these -- the delays that we saw in some of these markets for you guys, I know the underlying demand is there, that's pretty clear. ", ["Yeah. So, I think you're right. You're exactly right. There is only half the year left or less than half the year left now. We also have some bottlenecks for transportation. I think the underlying demand is there, that demand is not going away. So whatever we don't ship in 2019, we will ship in 2020 that you saw the perfect example to that is in January of this year when that work would be pin-up and shipped in January. So, it will really be a function to some degree of weather and timing on some large projects.\nI think -- if you don't mind, I'll stop and step back and kind of let you know how we look at the second half of the year. As you heard Suzanne say, we are very comfortable with our guidance. I think we tried to be thoughtful when we gave you guidance in February. We said the upper end would be good weather and jobs starting on time. The lower end would be increment weather and jobs delayed.\nAs you look at us giving guidance -- staying in that guidance range for the balance of the year, what we want to do is be prudent about weather and timing on jobs. We had a really good start to the year with January extremely strong with that flow through of work from 2018 pushing back.\nThe rest of the year shipments, the other five months has actually been at the high end of our guidance, next January. But now we need to remember that the third quarter is our most volatile quarter. It is the peak of the construction season, at the same time; it is also the heart of the storm season. We've all experienced one storm and luckily didn't flip us too bad. So, we're just trying to be realistic and transparent about storm threats in the middle of peak of construction season.\nIf you move to pricing, our pricing has consistently through the year been in line with guidance. We expect that to continue for the rest of the year, and our look at that is solid I believe in our guidance.\nAs we talk about our operating disciplines, we have executed well and created cost savings. All of that has driven double-digit unit margin growth for the first half of the year. We would expect that to continue for the balance of the year. So, I would think we'd be on the high side of Aggregates' volume guidance.\nMoving to Asphalt, Asphalt work was -- as we talked about was delayed in the first half because of rain in Tennessee, California, Texas, those are three of our biggest Asphalt states. So, in spite of very big backlogs and growing lettings and growing unit margins, some of that work may get pushed back just because of what we talked about the number of times.\nAs Suzanne mentioned, a bit extra cost in incentives and investment in unit margin on SAG. So, I would expect the year to play out this way. A bit stronger on Aggregates' earnings, a bit lower on Asphalt earnings. You put all that together, I would tell you that Suzanne and I are confident in the year in the middle of our guidance range."]], ["But I wanted to ask your backlogs are very strong, you've got a stronger outlook across your geographies and I know we're not talking formerly about 2020.\nBut if you look out over the next 12 to 18 months, what would be the limiting factor outside of say weather to drive volume growth as you see here -- it just sounds like your visibility has gotten better. ", ["I don't think I see inhibiting factors that would limit mid-single -- low to mid-single volume growth. I think that's achievable. I think when you get above that, it gets tougher because of things like transportation and labor for our customers, not for us but for our customers.\nYou also are seeing maturity on a lot of highway dollars and mixed in that are bigger and bigger more complex jobs, the timing of which it can be all over the place. We've had a few jobs delayed even this year with some big highway work and still we're shipping well within our -- excuse me, the top end of our range of guidance.\nSo, to answer your question, I don't see it for the numbers that you say. Now, if you want to get to high single-digit, yeah, you start to get compressed with labor and transportation and just our customers' capacity."]], ["Suzanne, I wanted to pick up on that last that last comment, and if you think about the performance in the quarter, despite some of the headwinds, it doesn't actually seem like that much of a heavy lift to get -- you're not just at the top end of the volume guide, but maybe a bit above the volume guide for the year and Tom I know you made the comment that maybe it's high-end of that and then so the 5% range, but has just more specifically thinking about what you've seen quarter-to-date, is there anything you'd point out as far as volume cadence? ", ["Yeah, I think, let's just concentrate on the third quarter and really for the balance of the year, but I think what you heard me say was, we're trying to be prudent, going into the third quarter and the underscore there is the third quarter is the peak of the construction season, but it's also the peak of the storm season.\nSo that can go really, really well or that can go really, really tough or it can be a mixed bag. And so I think us telling you the high end of our guidance is trying to take some of that into for volume is trying to take some of that into account. The perfect example to that is what we saw in the first half in California. And so it's really trying to be thoughtful and trying to give you our best educated expectation of what we expect based on history and based on our backlogs and based on what we see is a booking pace.\nSuzanne Wood\nThat's right. And I would, I would just add to this, I've got the numbers here for the second half last year in -- I have the third quarter as well. But let's not forget, last year in the third and fourth quarter, those who were not -- I don't really consider them to be terribly easy comparisons. If you look at the second half last year, our volume grew 9%, our gross profit per ton grew 11%, and for the two quarters combined, our flow-through was about 63%. That's a pretty good performance that we would be talking about over-achieving here. Price was at 2%, perhaps there is some upside there, but it was a pretty strong volume and gross profit per ton second half."]], ["The second question I had is bigger picture, you kind of alluded to a few different time some of the internal initiatives and now some of these are earlier stage than others, but can you give us a flavor on some of the internal initiatives that you're using to drive unit margins over the next couple of years? ", ["From a very high level, what drives our quality earnings is what drives gross profit per ton. Again, at a high level, that would include four areas of focus, commercial excellence, our logistics efficiencies, number three how we procure our goods and services and the fourth, our operating disciplines and the disciplines around those efficiencies that drive cost. Now we've been working on these at different stages over the last few years. We've invested in people and processes and systems to improve our metrics in our disciplines.\nAnd what you're seeing is results, improvements in our gross profit per ton. Again, bragged on our people in this earlier, we've put together now three quarters where we've had double-digit improvement unit margins, so solid work. But as you pointed out, we are far from being done, we got a long ways to go. And when you start talking about goalposts, this -- you got to remember this is an ultra-local business, and every one of our markets and submarkets has their goalposts. But putting those together is not as nearly as important as what happens on that local level. So this is exciting. We've done a lot of hard work. We got a lot more hard work to do. So but I congratulate our folks for being disciplined and being diligent with this, but more to come on these efforts."]], ["But with concerns about the cycle that really took hold towards the end of last year, one thing that supports a higher multiple is an elongated cycle, which comes from visibility and from the larger type projects, and I know you talked about it, Tom, in your prepared remarks.\nCan you speak to the visibility we have right now and the growth trajectory? ", ["All right. What we said was mid-cycle, we\u2019d about 255 million tons. And if you look at the cycle right now, let\u2019s take it in pieces. On the public side, we\u2019re stronger than we would have predicted five years ago. You\u2019ve got substantial funding from states. In fact, that funding in our states is up some 60% over 2015 level. So and \u2013 and not much of that is flowed through yet. So you\u2019ve got four, five years of big growth in highway demand.\nTurning to the private side. On the residential, we see \u2013 we\u2019ve continued to see growth in the residential in our markets. Our customers feel good about single-family growth. Looking out, we see exciting markets with housing growth and a few that we\u2019re watching. What I\u2019d put on the watch list would be San Francisco, Nashville and Chicago. Exciting markets would be Houston, Southern California, Tampa, Jacksonville, all of Florida, a lot of the Southeast.\nSo the fundamentals of residential growth are still in place, population growth, employment growth in very low inventories of houses. So in our footprint, we still see growth in res. I would call out non-res very similar. Our backlogs, our booking pace are strong \u2013 we\u2019re shipping strong, our customers outlook is positive on non-res. So, we still see strength both on the private side and the public side."]], ["Just a confirmation that this certainly should be positive for pricing going forward?\nAnd then second, on a follow-up to that, could you just give more quantification or color on the commentary of project type mix in the quarter and how this impacted pricing for the quarter? ", ["Yes, thank you. The quarter \u2013 the pricing momentum in our markets continues to improve. This was, as we predicted, third quarter, fourth quarter last year. The mix was about 40 basis points. All of that was base, which a higher base refines in a cold wet weather is not unusual. It\u2019s also indicative of new highway construction.\nBut overall, we\u2019re seeing widespread pricing momentum across our vast majority of our markets. In fact, all the one market \u2013 every market we reinstall price increases, they\u2019re for one and that one was flat. The \u2013 I think the foundation of this is the visibility to that highway growth and the continued demand growth and shipping growth on the private side.\nOur January and April price increases to fixed plants were all in place. And we\u2019ll see bid work push up throughout the year. And as you know, bid work is a campaign over time, it\u2019s not a one-time price increase.\nSo the 2019 price increases came out of the gate strong. But I think what\u2019s really important here is, it provides a good start to our improve unit margins. As we said, those unit margins were up a 11% in the quarter. And this is the second quarter in a row that we\u2019ve grown unit margins in the face of some pretty tough conditions. And that\u2019s simply sound execution and disciplines under difficult circumstances by our people.\nAnd if you remember, if you kind of look back over time, this is usual for us. If you look back six years, we\u2019ve gone from $3 \u2013 roughly $3 to just under $3 to almost $5 from the trailing 12-month basis on unit margins, that\u2019s 12% compounded annual growth rate and we saw 11% in the first quarter. So my hats off to our sales and ops folks and we thank them for that. And this is our job and we\u2019ll keep looking at it.\nSuzanne Wood\nYes. I just add one thing there, Kathryn, going back to the commentary around base sales and the fact that our \u2013 that produced a bit of unfavorable product mix of about 40 basis points. Our base sales did increase pretty substantially in the first quarter year-over-year. Last year, they constituted about 22%, this year, about 27%. So that\u2019s about 500 bps up. So to \u2013 given that significant increase to only have a product mix effect of about 40 basis points, I think is pretty good."]], ["There\u2019s nothing that you guys see looking out that would represent a downside risk to the current infrastructure demand, kind of like what we saw in 2017 where there were project delays or engineering constraints. ", ["There\u2019s enough flowing through, I would expect it to be a little smoother. You got to remember, we were back to 2017, that was just a couple of states that had new highway bills. Now we\u2019ve got 10 of our states that have all passed increased funding, that funding increases $20 billion a year versus over 10 states, where the federal bill is $45 billion a year over 50 states.\nSo this is substantial. It\u2019s big. It\u2019s widespread. And I think will there be air pockets of how fast it grows by or it will be, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be a smooth go up. I would expect it to always be going up over the next four or five years, though."]], ["So then, if we look at the bulk of the remaining, I think, that would translate to roughly 10-ish million in terms of headwinds from some of the maintenance and repair costs. ", ["So that\u2019s a good question. On the call California \u2013 so cost went up 3%, I will look at this way. California was about a percent of that. And even \u2013 now with that said, I think, our folks did a good job, they just had a tough go of it and that happened we had that much rain.\nThe other 2% \u2013 about 1.5% that would be R&M. I said R&M, repair and maintenance and this is we took plants down, because it was not a good time to run. And that\u2019s what we should have been doing and then when the sun comes out, the season will \u2013 we can run at maximum efficiencies. And then inventories was about a 0.5%, and again that was by design and that you don\u2019t need to be trying to build inventories when you have operating efficiency. So that\u2019s how I look at it.\nAs I look through the quarter, I would expect \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t see big shifts in inventories. I wouldn\u2019t expect California to \u2013 the sunshine back sign in the California back running. I think that operating team is very talented and they will do a very good job with that. And our R&M will level as the year goes along and we start running."]], ["And is it sustainable as we kind of start moving into the busier time here as we look at the backlog that you have, as we look at the states that you\u2019re in and the increase in funding? ", ["I think, what I see is, this is sustainable. In fact, I think it is going to compound that growth rate over time, as funding within a state matures and then as funding between each state comes online. So I would expect it to be stronger over time. You\u2019re seeing it in our backlogs, you\u2019re seeing it in the highway lettings, you\u2019re seeing it in the highway \u2013 in the state\u2019s highways budgets. It is \u2013 the bottom line of it is, it is the maturing of the DOTs into their funding. And as we said, it takes two years and then it ramps up over time.\nSuzanne Wood\nYes. I think Tom is exactly right on that. I mean this is just a natural progression. It takes about two years. And so you\u2019re beginning to see come through now some of which we had hoped would have come through last year, but it just takes longer when the projects are initially beginning to ramp up."]], ["One is, what percentage of your territories you had the price increases in January and what percentage was in April?\nAnd the second question is, you did not have much M&A activity in the quarter.

So it was \u2013 and I would expect that throughout the year.\nAs far as M&A, we\u2019re always working on a few of these that\u2019s happening today. It\u2019s always hard \u2013 it\u2019s to predict what\u2019s going to happen M&A as the seller side, when they want to sell and we don\u2019t have a lot of control over that. I think, what I was \u2013 what I look forward for us in M&A is, I\u2019ve said there\u2019s a lot, it\u2019s discipline \u2013 be disciplined about what you\u2019re going to buy and be disciplined about those synergies that are unique to us, try not to pay for those, make sure you don\u2019t overpay pressure test the project.

", ["I will start with the public side. We think Caltrans is doing a good job accelerating to SB-1 funding and the lettings. We have already backlogged over 30 projects. We are -- we know of another 15 to 20 projects that will bid in the next few months. So they are really doing a good job of getting worked out, getting it let and we are starting to see -- starting to ship that.\nRemember, in California, it does -- we are the largest Aggregate producer but we are also the largest Asphalt producer and these early jobs have a lot of hot mix in them. So we are very encouraged by Caltrans and how quickly they have taken that funding put in the lettings and we will see that work shift throughout 2019.\nOn the res side, I would tell you in the vast majority of markets in California, we continue to see growth in residential. As I called out, the Bay Area maybe -- would probably be the exception to that and that we will see some weakness there, when it\u2019s still -- the fundamentals are there and inventories are still quite low in California.\nNon-res, we see strength in our backlogs and our booking phase in non-res. So we think we will see growth in California in non-res in \u201819."]], ["My second question is with respect to the guidance around Asphalt and so just hoping to understand that a bit better, I think the combined three categories you are guiding for in dollar terms an increase of something like $16 million to $22 million in gross profit. ", ["Well, I think, the improvement -- the 15%. 20% that Suzanne talked about in other products, the -- you are right, the majority of that is in Asphalt. Looking back a little bit \u201818 was just a really tough year for us in the Asphalt product line. We had -- wet weather didn\u2019t help us but really we got caught with the cost of rapidly rising liquid cost which cost us over $50 million.\nBut with the new public funding coming through strong in Vulcan markets, we are expecting to see double-digit growth in volumes in \u201819. It\u2019s supported by backlogs and what we see bidding in highway lettings in \u201819 which is very strong.\nWe believe that the liquid prices should stabilize, are stabilizing and we think we will see some modest improvement in unit margins as we work through \u201819. Remember we have been -- we raised prices dramatically all the way through \u201818 so we are starting to catch that.\nWe are always behind the liquid price. We are starting to catch it now, and we should see much improved performance in the Asphalt product line in \u201819 over \u201818 driven by demand and price improvements and stabilization of pricing or cost in liquid AC.\nSuzanne Wood\nAnd I would just add to that in terms of the pricing, I -- in my remarks I had called out the fact that we had increased prices by about 6% in that Asphalt sector for the full year. But in the fourth quarter, we increased by about 7%, so you can see that that is on an accelerating trend as we are trying to catch up with those costs, the majority of which happened with big spikes in the second half of the year."]], ["I wanted to ask about the cost performance in Aggregates, you obviously had good fixed cost leverage and cost outs enough to offset rising prices, for example, diesel and other costs. ", ["Yeah. Look, Suzanne and I are very proud of our operating teams and their performance improving their operating disciplines in the fourth quarter and actually throughout 2018. As I mentioned in my remarks, they finished the year with a world-class safety performance, which is -- just speaks to the discipline in operating side of the business.\nAnd they actually lowered their cost in the fourth quarter and the full year in the face of dramatically rising fuel costs and probably some pretty wet conditions. I\u2019d just say that\u2019s just a job well done and great momentum that we carry into \u201819.\nAs you guys know this operating discipline is a key part of our continuous quest to improve our unit margins. It\u2019s just part of that formula and the good news I would tell you is, I don\u2019t think our operators are done. I think they still have potential out there and I kind of know this that they are working hard to implement their 2019 execution plans, while they build on that \u201818 performance. So I just tell you, I am really pleased with our operators and encouraging them that we are not done that we will keep the momentum and improve on it in \u201819.\nSuzanne Wood\nAnd I will just add to that too. I mean when you think about our business, you can really drive it down to something pretty simple that sets us apart from others, perhaps, and that is our unit profitability.\nOur main goal is to drive that unit profitability, that\u2019s something that isn\u2019t one year initiative, as Tom said. It\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s ongoing because you can\u2019t stand still with that. You have got to continue to move it forward and we have got three ways to do it, you focus on pricing, you focus on volume and then you focus on operating efficiencies, and the discipline and the accountability in each of the plans.\nAnd like Tom, I am very proud of what we have accomplished here for the year and in particular for the last few months. I especially like focusing on the operational efficiencies and driving costs at the plant level because I call that self-help.\nIt\u2019s something that\u2019s within our control. It\u2019s not something that you are waiting for that could be impacted by a number of things, not least of which is weather. So, yes, that\u2019s an ongoing effort and it\u2019s something, I can tell you, we think about and talk about here every single week."]], ["Does that affect the relationship between volume and pricing in any way, I mean, we have heard arguments from investors both ways, it might depress the relationship or it might enhance it. ", ["I think it\u2019s really the visibility to the future is what impacts price and so that people know that there is volume coming and jobs coming they can take risk on the jobs they are bidding at that point. And that\u2019s really important because as we move through the recovery, the public side moving up rapidly is much clear, those jobs are very public.\nThe DOTs, everybody knows within six to 12 months of what\u2019s going to let and how it\u2019s letting and those lettings are increasing dramatically in our markets. That does a whole lot to give our customers and entire segment visibility to what\u2019s coming to be able to risk price.\nSuzanne Wood\nYeah. And I would just add to that with respect to the highway shipments, I mean, the timing might not always be precise and crystal clear on those, but the direction of travel certainly is. It\u2019s something that we and our customers and others in the space can get their minds around.\nAnd I think that the sales folks here really did a good job in the early fall kind of setting the tone for price increases upcoming volumes by sending out price increase letters and talking to our customers really, really early on that.\nBecause that, if you have that conversation with your customers and everyone understands what the expectations are prior to our customers speaking to their customers and going down the chain, it just gives them the time to do what they need to do and it just creates a much better pricing environment and I think with the sequential and year-over-year pricing improvement that we saw Q3 and Q4, I think it really that was a good starting point for it."]], ["So I am wondering, if you folks can expand on just the comments you made on the drivers of price acceleration into the fourth quarter of \u201818 and as I think about what \u201819 could look like as a result relative to the guide, the starting point is plus 5 and we have price increases coming over the course of \u201819. ", ["Yeah. I think that, first of all, I -- we are very pleased with the momentum and the pick-up. That\u2019s what we thought was going to happen in the second year and it just goes to our visibility as I spoke to earlier of the bid work and the backlog pricing and it\u2019s underscored with the fixed plant pricing that we saw in January and we will see in April.\nWe have done this before. We have seen it before. We have stepped up and it just over time in sequence. So I think we feel very good about it. Whereas this past year in \u201818, was very much back-half loaded. I think we will continue to grow prices as we go through \u201819. I don\u2019t think it will be as choppy as \u201818. I think it will be much smoother. But as we work off old work and we put new work on it will move up.\nNow remember, the comps will get tougher as you go throughout the year also. But -- so I would always, I think, we will see the prices ease up as we go through the year. I just don\u2019t think it will be quite as choppy if \u201818, if I am answering your question."]], ["And just to take a step back in the early phases of this recovery, you folks have certainly been leading the markets from a pricing standpoint and you have highlighted at your Analyst Day that that had come at the expense of some share. ", ["I think whether it\u2019s the competitive landscape or our customers, I think, what\u2019s really going to support pricing and I am kind of repeating myself is the visibility and the clarity to the growing public work and while we will see big growth in public demand in \u201819 and solid in private, \u201820 will be more public work and \u201821 will be the more public work.\nBecause remember in all of these states where we have seen increasing funding they have got to mature through the process and so the jobs and work are going to build as we are able to take those funds and put them to work and hopefully put them to shipments of stones. So that visibility and that growing demand was really what\u2019s going to support price increases throughout Vulcan-served markets."]], ["I am curious you have been talking about it in the past several months everybody has that we are going to be a little bit more thoughtful about the way we model weather in there that not every day is going to be a blue sky.

I think if you look at the last two quarters, it gives me a lot of confidence in that guidance and I will give you two, three reasons why. One, the price increases continue to accelerate and we have got a lot of confidence in that.\nTwo our sales volumes in the fourth quarter were really strong in spite of wet weather and a little -- that being said, that tells me that the contractors have got big backlogs and they have got to get work done. When the sun comes out, they got to make hay and we saw some of them really execute on that in Q4.\nAnd the third, as we talked about earlier, our operators executed with real discipline in the face of higher fuel costs and tough wet conditions in the fourth quarter and we will carry that forward.\nSo, as we look into \u201819, I think that guidance I think we were thoughtful about weather and maybe some other headwinds and what we have to do regardless of the outside forces to make sure that we make our guidance."]], ["So, with that in mind, if we have more normalized weather this year, does that mean we hit the midpoint of guidance straight and when I say normalized, I mean maybe a little bit less of the rain that we have had.

", ["Yes. Sure. I will -- I will try to address just your first point on whether the comps were easier or not. I mean we have talked about a lot of the pressures that we had -- cost pressures we had this year and in particular in fourth quarter those continued.\nOur diesel fuel pricing was actually or our diesel fuel costs were actually higher this year in fourth quarter than last year. We had, even though we didn\u2019t call them out, because we are trying to perhaps move away a bit from calling out some of these, what I consider to be sort of relatively small items unless it\u2019s material and unless it\u2019s trend-worthy.\nSo we didn\u2019t go through a detailed weather exercise in the fourth quarter. Although, I think for those of us who watch the weather channel obsessively it certainly was pretty wet in fourth quarter.\nSo I think again with $5 million more in diesel fuel with some disruption from rail where we had to truck items around quarter-over-quarter, I think, that that increase in EBITDA of $53 million was pretty real. I am not sure that I would necessarily consider that to be the easiest comp in the whole wide world.\nYou also raised the question on inventory in the fourth quarter and what we did with respect to that, and look, our inventory is based on production planning that we do every single week. We put together that production plan based on the demand picture that we see what is in our backlog and what we expect very near-term shipments to be.\nAnd so, in the quarter we had a very slight inventory build, it was around 3 million tons or so, the delta between Q4 \u201817 and Q4 \u201818 and that had less than -- certainly less than a $10 million impact. It is mostly fixed cost that you are talking about. So pretty minor stuff with respect to that and again it was on the basis of what we expected those really near-term shipments to be and I am glad we did it. Tom, do you have anything to add?\nTom Hill\nNo. I think you covered that well. Thank you."]], ["Just wanted to get an update on Aggregates USA integration and really focusing on what progress you are seeing with the revenue synergies that you had outlined previously really realistically would be fitting in \u201819 into \u201820, but if you could you just give an update on revenue synergy progress with Aggregates USA?

It\u2019s a great strategic fit between their distribution network, our distribution network, their quarries and our quarries and how we piece all of those pieces of the puzzle together.\nOur execution has been very successful. We are actually ahead of the planned -- quite a bit ahead of the plan on unit margins. We had -- as you know, we had some rail service issues that we experienced in \u201818 that hurt us, but we think we put most of that behind us and as we look at Ag USA, we think \u201819 is shaping up to be a very good year to take full advantage of the synergies between all those operations."]], ["And I guess, when you think about government shutdown risk, that\u2019s obviously dissipating right now, but how do you think about the prospect that the two parties come together and get an infrastructure bill negotiated this year and what\u2019s the risk that projects get delayed on the public side next year with funding winding down on the federal side by 2020 if no new bill gets passed? ", ["The short answer is shutdown was really no impact. We had a few states that pushed jobs back about a few months into later lettings, but really no impact on us, and as you know, the Feds already distributed the funding for \u201819.\nOn the federal highway bill what we know this, is that House T&I Chairman Peter DeFazio is working hard on an infrastructure bill. DeFazio wants to solve the Highway Trust Fund issue. We for sure want to support him in that and our country needs that. So the need is there, both parties want this to happen. But I wouldn\u2019t venture to guess what\u2019s going to happen with that yet.\nNow if -- as we go into \u201820 and we have seen -- I don\u2019t see any pushback or problems with the FAST Act in \u201820. If you get to the end of it, it runs out, the Feds are not going to let funding go down they are not going to let it to be unfunded. Now that gives some -- I believe in \u201821 that will give some -- maybe some short-term views for problems for DOTs.\nBut remember you also have massive state and local funding improvements and as we called out in the prepared remarks, the federal highway bill is $45 million. That\u2019s not going to go away, but in our markets -- per year, but in our markets, $45 billion, excuse me, but in our markets you have an improvement of another $20 billion per year that\u2019s just now starting to flow through in increase.\nSo I am always worried about the Highway Trust Fund. It\u2019s something we work hard on. It\u2019s something everybody needs. But I think we will be fine as long as our federal government works hard to fix that problem and it may take some time and some effort to fix, but I believe it will be fixed."]], ["And then maybe a follow-up back on Asphalt, I think, Suzanne, you mentioned sort of this gradual impact of offsetting the higher liquid asphalt costs as you go through these contracts. ", ["I wouldn\u2019t think they look a lot different from past cycles. I have seen too many of these to count I think. But I wouldn\u2019t say you look a lot different than other cycles. The big question is, we have seen liquids stabilize. We think it will maybe stay at where it is or maybe come up a little bit in the year, but not the big spike in ramp up that we saw through \u201818 and in doing that you will have that time which we are already catching up on to raise prices and get that material margin where it ought to be.\nI think we are already seeing that. I believe that based on our hot mix prices and our liquid prices, but I\u2019d also tell you, the first quarter is a tough barometer there because the Asphalt business is just tough in the first quarter. The weather keeps just cold and wet so it keeps just -- so the tale of that will be how do we -- how does that come across in Q2 and we will have obviously better visibility of that when we get to the end of the first quarter."]], ["And then lastly for me and I'll pass it on is, you mentioned, Suzanne, capital spending, operating and maintenance CapEx dialing that back a little bit from $250 million to $225 million, and I think growth from $350 million to $300 million. ", ["Not really. I mean, we are still in the early stages of our planning and budgeting. I guess if I had to say something on a very, very preliminary basis, it would be in terms of the operating and maintenance side. That will probably be relatively in line with what you will have seen us spend this year with respect to growth CapEx. And actually \u2013 we're actually having a big roundtable discussion about that here next week, so I think it would be a little bit preliminary to give you a guide on that, other than to say that as we had indicated, we had a number of projects on line for growth spending this year. And if I had to give you a directional comment one way or the other, I would not expect it to be quite as high next year, but we'll firm that up when we give fourth quarter guidance. Does that help?"]], ["I wonder, Suzanne, I'd love to hear as you step up into your new role, can you just talk about the strategic priorities that you see for the organization over the next 12 months? ", ["Yeah, absolutely. That's a fair question and I'll try to give you a couple of examples of that. I mean, first and foremost, our strategic focus needs to be on improving our business, and when I say that to be specific that means improving our unit profitability. So all the actions you see us take with respect to pricing improvements, with respect to improving efficiencies across all of our plants with respect to any other initiatives we put in place, it's all around driving that unit profitability.\nAnd in addition to that, making sure that when we are deploying our capital, we are doing it in a very disciplined and thoughtful way to drive an appropriate return on that. So, really getting sort of into things with operations. It's something I love doing and I plan on working hard to try to help the field identify some of those unit profitability improvements and getting those into place.\nAnd then in addition to that, just making sure that all of that hard work converts into a good cash flow stream, I think is key. So, those are the priorities. I hope that's helpful and I look forward to updating you on those and talking about those as we go through the year."]], ["So Tom, if there is a view out there that hasn't moved sideways and just given the backlog and visibility you have on public, how do you think about growth the next years? ", ["So let's back up Q3, we saw that momentum. Q4, we're in October. We're seeing that growth momentum. I would describe the private side as solid. I would describe the public side is growing, and we're turning those rapidly-growing public funding and Aggregates shipments now, which we've been waiting for a while. But if you look at states like Georgia, Texas, South Carolina Tennessee, California, just to name a few, there's big, big public demand growth. So I think if we step back and let's put it in a little different perspective. If you look at nine of our states, which constitute over 80% of our revenues, the highway funding and local initiative funding in those states is up $20 billion per year. And most of those shipments haven't hit us yet.\nWe haven't converted those tax revenues into shipments. And if you put that on a \u2013 compared to a federal bill, that would be an increase of almost 50% in a federal bill in just nine states. So that's a sea change in public funding and it's just now starting to flow through, so it'll flow through, it'll continue to increase in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022. But this is a big deal and it underpins our confidence in the markets and the demand in those markets."]], ["So, I wanted to ask you a question around the 2019 guide and more conceptually around kind of how you're approaching things relating to obviously last year having some major storm impacts, this year having some major storm impacts. ", ["How do you know the conversations we're having right now? Actually, we're just working through that, and that's a great question and one that, if you look at the mid-single digit volume, I would tell you we have solid confidence in that. How we vary from that will be timing of \u2013 as I said earlier, timing of large jobs. We've still got to step back and look at weather effect and how that works, which is extremely hard to do, but we'll get through it. And I think we'll give you a much clearer answer in February. I'm not trying to dodge your question, but that work is going on as we speak."]], ["And then thinking about kind of the capital structure into next year, if 2 times to 2.5 times is the number, I mean, you should be right at the low-end, if not below, depending upon assumptions. ", ["I'll let Suzanne take this, but I'll start with telling you that our capital priorities haven't changed. As you look at the M&A out there, we are as I said earlier, we're really focused on capturing the synergies of the acquisitions we've made and the greenfield work that we're working on, both of those tend to be some of our highest returns. But remember, our biggest engine of growth is going to be the volume growth and growing unit margins. You got a taste of that in Q3. It's exciting. We see it flowing rapidly into October and November. So \u2013 but I'll let Suzanne take capital priorities.\nSuzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.\nYeah, absolutely. I mean, just adding on to what Tom said, which I agree with, the capital allocation priorities do remain the same. You know what they are. We've got a bit of both in there. But they are predicated on the waterfall that shows us making sure that we spend an appropriate amount of operating CapEx to make sure that our existing business that we maintain and grow the value of the franchise. We do have an eye toward a progressive dividend. We've talked about the fact that we want to make absolutely sure that it can be sustained through the cycle regardless of the amount. Whatever we get to, we just need to be able to sustain it. But we would expect that to progressively grow in line with earnings.\nWe look at growth CapEx. We've talked a bit about that. And then, we also have in the capital allocation priority returning excess cash to shareholders, primarily via share repurchase. And we have been in the market. Through the end of the third quarter, we spent about $100 million with respect to share repurchase. So, our job is to balance all those in an appropriate way and be disciplined about the use of capital and make sure that it goes into the areas that will be highest returning.\nWith respect to M&A in particular, obviously, we're going to look at M&A opportunities as they arise. But we will be returns focused. We will be thoughtful about multiples. We certainly don't want to be in a position where we overpay, particularly when there are other competing uses of our capital.\nAnd I just want to reiterate the point, as Tom said, M&A is an important part of growth to the extent you get the right fit and the right returns. But always, always same-store growth, improving the business that you have is always going to be the most profitable business you have, and also the lowest risk because you own it and you have complete control over what you're doing.\nSo, we'll continue to look, but our principal focus, I think, in the near term is going to be fully integrating those businesses we have acquired, betting them down to make sure we capture all the synergies that we planned and that we can capture. And then, as I said earlier, I think it may have been the first or second question, we want to focus on making sure in our same-store businesses that we are improving that unit profitability. Does that help?"]], ["I guess my first question is just as you look out to 2019, can you just speak to some of the inflationary buckets in the Aggregates group that you are concerned about? ", ["If you step back and look at the Aggregates business and with the Aggregates-focused business, we're just different and I'd call us special in this area. We have clear potential to do quite well in an environment of rising commodity cost. And that's really driven by three things; improving prices; compounding over time, which we've talked about; and remember, higher fuel and logistics only widens the moat and now you're starting to see us starting to capture the widening of that moat. You saw the tip of that in Q3.\nWe own our major input, which is the rock in the ground. And the third point is there's plenty of room for improving unit margins with prices, better operating execution, and seeing fixed cost leverage. I'd take you back, as a reminder, over the past five years since the recovery began, our total cost of sales is up less than 1% per year with diesel being up 7% per year. So if you talk to our folks, they'd tell you that improving unit margins no matter what happens at the outside, it is our job, it's what we do. You saw progress of that in the third quarter. You've seen us do this before and you see us take great momentum on this into Q4 into 2019. So I have great confidence that we'll continue to grow unit margins regardless.\nSuzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.\nYeah. I would just add there, also referencing back to the slide deck when you get a chance. On slide 4, we have put in some longer-term trend data where we actually calculate our compound annual growth rate and we measure that as against trailing 12-month second quarter 2013, sort of really the start of the recovery.\nI like this slide because it shows that the improvements we made are not sort of one quarter, one-year type improvement. These are incremental compounding improvements that we need to stay focused on and continue to drive. On that slide, it specifically calls out the one measure, which I think is a great one and says a lot about how nimble and flexible Vulcan is when it comes to managing through sort of whatever comes at you over a five-year period, and that's unit cost of sales has increased less than 1% over that five-year period.\nAnd also on the slide, it's what I think is one of the most exciting numbers on the page and that is that through some compounding pricing improvement, over that five-year period, through managing our costs and efficiencies at the plant level, over that same period, our compound annual growth rate and gross profit per ton is 13%. That's a pretty \u2013 it's a pretty strong business model to take us forward."]], ["Just wanted to ask also on, if you think about pricing into 2019, I think as we were coming into this year, Tom, you were pretty bullish about pricing accelerating, particularly in the Southeast.

We've seen really good unit margin improvement in California. You've heard us talk about prices with step function in California over last year and this year, and I think that continues. They've also done a really good job of improving their cost and a lot of their operating efficiencies.\nSo, I think the issue \u2013 and I'm really looking at from a growth and unit margin perspective, I'll give both price and how I see that.

Gulf Coast, I would tell you a little slower and kind of \u2013 not a little bit of growth in volumes, some price increases.

In fact, one of the largest ever done is right outside of our quarry in San Diego, which we're really excited about. It'll start to really crank up next year.\nIf you look at res in our markets just fundamentally, ours are stronger than most around the country and the fundamentals are just there. You got population growth. You got continuing employment growth. You still got low inventories of houses, I think. So we see continued steady growth in res, maybe not as robust as it's been in the past, but steady. Maybe probably a little stronger in single than multi, which is okay for us because it's more Aggregates-intensive.\nSuzanne H. Wood - Vulcan Materials Co.\nYeah.

", ["Sure. I'll touch on probably the newest ones. I think Georgia is actually starting to flow-through. We're seeing shipments on those big projects that we've talked about. Texas is the most mature, we've got Prop 7, as you know, with additional $3 billion in 2019, they've really got their act together, and I think they'll get that worked out pretty fast. On the IMPROVE Act in Tennessee, which is a 40% increase in funding in Tennessee. Tennessee DOT, I would describe it has done an excellent job and one of the fastest to get worked out. We're already starting to ship on both Asphalt and Aggregates on projects. We've got a lot of work \u2013 a number of jobs booked for 2019. As I said, we'll actually see a little bit in 2018, which is quite quick.\nSouth Carolina is a little slower. We've not seen anything in 2018, probably see it being in 2019. But remember, South Carolina had the big bonds from a few years ago, so we've seen a big slug of big interstate work, which we'll ship on \u2013 we're shipping on now and will flow into 2019, which will kind of bridge us over to Act 40 (60:46). Is that giving you some clarity?"]], ["And just finally I wanted to ask about the cost control, besides just managing your operations around the weather, is there anything else that you have to highlight in terms of what's helping you reduce costs at your quarries? ", ["Sure. It's just core disciplines, and we've taken a look at our largest facilities, a number of them had teams look at them for opportunity searches. I think our folks are always doing this. If I took you to any of our plants, they're going to have a conversation about how to improve throughput of the plant, how to improve downtime in the plant, how to get more out of their fuel costs, out of their explosives costs. There's nothing here that is anything except for really, really good hard core operating disciplines and attention to detail and sharing knowledge across our footprint. And if you talk to any of our folks, they'd just tell you that's their job, that's what they do."]], ["Really, if you could just kind of go into more detail on how to think about the flow-through in the bridge to your expectations here in the back half understanding your \u2013 some of these things are behind you. ", ["Trey, I'll start and \u2013 just with a view of the quarter in the first half, and I think Tom will comment on the full-year, and we're going to clarify as best we can. First thing we would say, as we said in the prepared remarks and in the release, is we're on plan. For the Aggregates segment, we are on our plan for the first half of the year. Albeit driven a little bit by stronger shipments than originally projected, offsetting the higher diesel cost than we had expected. But we are on our plan for the first half of the year.\nAnd in terms of flow-throughs and just the way we look at it as a management team, internally. One, always trying to take a little bit longer-term view of that number. But as we look at the first half, first, you got to look at it on a same-store basis. I'll just remind everybody, the flow-through on acquired revenue, particularly Ag U.S.A., is always going to distort those numbers. So, you got to look at it on a same-store basis.\nAs we look at same-store flow-through the first half, we see 43%, absent the year-over-year impact in diesel, which we will overcome as we move forward and put in their own (00:22:57) pricing, that's 56%. I noted in the release, I don't want to distract anybody, but if you look at the pensionary class and what that did absent that, it's 59% to 60%. So, our main message on flow-through and on the business as a whole for the first half is that we are on plan.\nWe also expect those flow-throughs, as we've said, I think all year long, to improve meaningfully in the second half such that the full-year number is basically in line with what you'd expect from our beginning-of-year guidance, of course, and at or slightly above that 60% long-term number.\nJ. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.\nYeah. Trey, in the second half, we will definitely see flow-through improvement and it's really driven by three things. Number one, prices will continue to rise. Our backlog pricing is much higher. You've got fuel offset in that. And also we're just simply working off our work. We've got some work we're working off right now that's one or two years old and is priced out long ago.\nThen, second, we'll see significant cost improvements. First piece of that is we've moved past the old storm-related and some of the transportation costs that we saw last year and we saw in the first half of the year. The second piece of that is we'll reap the benefit and not the cost of the first half improvements we did in some big plants that we took down in preparation for the season.\nAnd the third thing is, you're just going to see that volume growth continue and it's really driven by the big jump in public demand. So, I think we're confident in how we did in the first half and how it sets us up in the second half.\nJohn R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.\nAnd then, Trey, if you wanted to square \u2013 and others, if you want to square the guidance for the year and just taking a look at the total business and kind of how we get there, again, this is all consistent with our plan. We're looking for about $160 million of profit improvement in the second half year-over-year. And again, if the question is how do you get there, here's the way we look at it.\nWe've got significant benefit in the second half from acquisitions, about $30 million year-over-year that's mostly Ag U.S.A. We've got, as you know, significant operating cost and margin improvement in the Aggregates segment in the second half. Again, we're comping over a bunch of storm-related cost in the second half that shouldn't repeat, that's about another $30 million to $35 million.\nWe've got approximately 10 million more tons in the second half of this year on a same-store basis than we had in the second half of last year. That drives its own benefit at a strong flow-through way. As Tom mentioned, we've got higher pricing in the second half than a year ago. That's probably another $40 million of benefit year-over-year on the second half. We'll have a little bit of contribution from the downstream businesses, not a lot year-over-year given the headwinds in our Asphalt segment. And SAG, that's slightly up in the second half over the prior year, maybe $5 million, but largely flat.\nSo, look, our plan is basically intact. We're kind of following the exact plan we had at the beginning of the year. Only difference is really being higher aggregates shipments driven by stronger public shipments, which is fantastic, offsetting higher than anticipated diesel costs and helping offset what will be a full-year miss in our Asphalt segment."]], ["I mean, understanding you guys don't have a crystal ball either but some of the polls that we see look like \u2013 could be pretty much a coin toss at this point. ", ["Yeah, I think your opening comment about SB1 was completely accurate. There is a lot of noise, and there will continue to be noise for the next four months about it. But let's kind of step back on and look at the facts as we know it in California. And I would point out four things.\nNumber one, remember, California is the fifth largest economy in the world. And it's also got some of the country's worst roads. Number two, California voters understand how bad the roads are and of all \u2013 they've already supported 20 local initiatives that increase transportation funding, we saw that year-and-a-half ago. And fact number three, as you know, SB1 was firewalled for transportation uses only in June which is very good for us and also removes the biggest argument for repeal. And fact four, SB \u2013 you've got to remember, SB1 has incredibly broad and deep support in the state.\nSo, those are facts if we'd go on (00:28:16) California (00:28:17) don't forget three other points. Remember, Caltrans is already moving. So, by November, they will have already collected an additional $4.7 billion for highway construction. And those local initiatives that I mentioned earlier, they will raise $50 billion over the life of the initiatives. Fact number three, remember, Vulcan shipments and prices to the public market in California are going to be higher the second half of this year. They'll be higher than that in 2019, and they'll be higher than that in 2020 given our current pipeline and backlogs.\nSo, our success in California is enhanced by SB1 but it's not dependent on SB1. Look, we have a fantastic position in the fifth largest economy in the world. Our backlogs are higher, our \u2013 the pricing on those backlogs are higher than they've been in years and they're accelerating and that price momentum which was very good in first half of the year will continue to grow balance of this year and into next year and into 2020. So, again, our success in \u2013 we're going to be successful in California. SB1 will only enhance that."]], ["And then, related to that, if you think of SB1 as we head into the end of the year and maybe people \u2013 who knows \u2013 maybe some people get cold feet. ", ["Yeah. So, I mean, if you look at the shipments for the year, we're just a little ahead of where we were prior year in the quarter, they were down. Now, all of that is timing of how we work in California. As we said, we had a strong first quarter.\nThe private demand in California continues to be solid. The second half, its growth is some private but a lot of that is public flow-through. If you look at our backlogs, both in volume and price in California are up where we should be. We don't see a lot of SB1 in 2019. It'll really be in 2020 and beyond.\nBut, in spite of that, in 2019, our backlogs will support the volumes that we're projecting the second half. So \u2013 and, as I said in my comment about SB1, remember, Caltrans will have already collected additional $4.7 billion by November and you've got the impact of the local funding of an additional $1.35 billion. So, there's a lot of increased funding in California and I think we feel good about it. As I said, about \u2013 when I was talking about SB1, (00:34:26) second half of this year, we feel good about 2019, and that'll grow into 2020.\nJohn R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.\nAnd again, just to be clear, I mean, we're super excited about what Caltrans is doing. It's just we don't expect it to show up in our shipments in 2018 and that's always been our view that's not a change. So, anything that happens there is effectively upside but very good for 2019.\nJ. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.\nYes.\nJohn R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.\nThe shipment strength we saw in the quarter just as a reminder, came without help from California, without help from Virginia, without help from Georgia. Many of our higher priced markets, all those markets are super healthy long-term. Just some timing issues there in the quarter. And you're going to see good growth in all those areas in the second half.\nJ. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.\nWe have full flavor on Caltrans. And they really \u2013 like John said, they've done a good job. I mean, we've already backlogged 1 million tons of aggregate off of SB1 funding and about 300,000 tons of asphalt. This is really early in the game. I would not expect to see much of that in 2018. It will be 2019 and 2020."]], ["Still on the policy vein, wanted to shift coast and go to Georgia, Texas, Florida, Tennessee, and North Carolina, which we in our work have seen some better lettings in the first half of 2018.

And I'll talk about three markets where we've seen a big turn there.\nThe first one would be coastal Texas, and we saw a big turn in coastal Texas probably in the last six, eight months. We had a downturn there. It's recovered. The private side is recovering. There's good highway work. Our volumes are dramatically up. You're seeing prices \u2013 actually, prices in the second quarter rose over prices in the first quarter, and they'll continue to rise through the year. And all of that's driving marked improving profitability in coastal Texas.\nAnd that's without the impact of the energy work that you're hearing out there. There's dozens of energy jobs and billions of dollars that are in the planning stages. We don't expect to see that until 2019 and 2020. And then behind that, you're going to see, in 2019 and 2020, you'll start to see non-highway infrastructure pull through, with Harvey projects that are in the design stages right now. Those \u2013 I could \u2013 I think there's 30 of those in pre-planning process.

DOT is really solid private, really solid public. You're starting to see infrastructure \u2013 not how we infrastructure flow-through in Florida but with the big public work maturing in Florida, you get a better mix.

", ["I think that the second half incremental takes into account the increase in diesel cost. I think that that's built in. What we've told you, it is a headwind, but it continues to be less and less of a headwind as the year goes along.\nJohn R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.\nGarik, in the second half, we're probably expecting diesel of around \u2013 it varies by market \u2013 but around $2.60. So, obviously, there's some uncertainty around that. We'll kind of see how it plays out.\nBut, keep in mind, we've got basically stronger volumes offsetting diesel impact in the Aggregates segment. So, full-year, our expectation for the Aggregates segment is darn close to what it was at the beginning of the year. Slightly different way of getting there. We do expect to have a headwind from our Asphalt segment due liquid AC costs relative to our beginning-of-year expectations. But when we sit at the end of the year and look backwards, we expect a flow-through rate in our Aggregates segment that's really not that different than what we've expected at the beginning of the year.\nAnd again, I'd just caution anybody, looking at just flow-throughs on a quarterly basis, they going \u2013 they swing a lot. So, you got to take a bit of a longer-term view. And I would remind that by the time we finish this year, we're going to look back over the previous five years and we're going to find out that our flow-through rate for five years have been about 62% or something. So, pretty much in line with long-term expectation."]], ["And just, A is, just a little more clarity around timing of what the guide assumes for new diesel surcharges or other price hikes.\nAnd second, I guess, related to your comment about the implied economic moat. ", ["Yeah. Let me take the diesel first. And as I said earlier on pricing, we're already pricing up to offset diesel costs. And those are our production costs and how it affects the quarries themselves. So, that's already happening, it'll take a little while to flow-through. As John said, a lot of times that takes six months for work to \u2013 once you book it to port to ship.\nAs far as the moats are concerned, what drives the moats is just increased freight costs for someone to come closer to you. And it just allows you to \u2013 as when you price, so let's say, five miles away two years ago versus today, that moat got wider and your prices go up. So, that's kind of as simple as that."]], ["So, when we're looking at the price guide for the second half, what would you say as far \u2013 is the mix impact in the geographic mix impact in your second half pricing commentary? ", ["The way I think about it is, to try and cut to the chase, we obviously build this bottom up as we look at it. So, I don't know that you'll see exactly the same kind of mix impact that you saw in the second quarter overtime, but we'll continue at this rate of growth. And we're growing shipments 10-plus-percent as we did in the second quarter. When you have that kind of rate of growth, you're a little bit, just as a mathematical definition, a little more prone to mix shifts. So, good, bad, sideways. So, I wouldn't try and read too much of that.\nTo help you, we're expecting in the second half year-over-year price improvements in that 3% to 4% range, in that range of about $0.40 a ton on a same-store basis. Just to give you a rough ballpark. And what I'd really underscore is continued further improvement in our quoted pricing which will further benefit late this year and into 2019.\nSo, there'll be more momentum probably in our quoted work than you see on our shift work, per Tom's comments. But think something on the order of $0.40, 3-ish percent, 3%, 4% in the mix. It's going to be what it is. We don't try and \u2013 the last thing in the world you'd ever want us to try and do is to avoid shipments in order to improve the average selling price. So, I hope that helps, but it's a positive story. And it's an acceleration, not a deceleration.\nJ. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.\nYeah. I think, important to note, we're pushing prices across all geographies, across all product lines. And so, when you \u2013 and so John said, when you talk about a mix effect, what happened in the second quarter, nothing \u2013 there's nothing bad with that. In fact, it's healthy and good. We simply sold more product in markets like Alabama, Arizona than we expected. That's a really good thing. And as you look at it, we're always going to maximize all the products in all geographies at the best price and margin possible."]], ["I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how much of your backlog might be comprised of these delayed projects that where price a long time ago and how long we might see that for? ", ["I would point out, we've got a number of very large projects that we're shipping. I don't know if they've been delayed now. At this point, we're shipping most of those. They'll ship throughout this year, may have a little bit go into 2019. But what's really important is the work you're bringing on is at much higher prices. And so, that mix will flow out over time. It will take balance of this year probably a little bit into 2019 to do that. But everything you're adding on is at higher prices. And we like the way that flows go and you can see it our backlogs and you can \u2013 it supports our plan for the second half of 2018.\nAs far as labor constraints, we don't have any labor constraints. John talked a little bit about this year \u2013 about this earlier where we saw our customers with volumes basically flat, grow their labor over the last two years, and they're reaping the benefit of that. If I had to weigh that, I would say, the private, which is more labor-intensive, could have some constraints. The public shipments, which are coming on strong, I don't see those constraints, not that they're not there to catch up, but on a day-to-day basis, unless you have, as John said, a big event.\nJohn also mentioned logistics with some headwinds, with rail and potential some trucking at times. But we think those are getting fixed. We got to work through them. But \u2013 so, pricing, as we've talked about, continues to flow through at higher levels. And I don't see a big impact on labor unless, as John said, we have an event and you're playing catch up."]], ["So for Aggregates USA, just trying to cut it up a little bit, it looks like things are progressing pretty well there, and I think you guys booked like something around 2 million tons, maybe a little below that in the quarter if my math is right, and you guys are guiding to 7 million tons for the year.\nSo, that implies a pretty big contribution in the first quarter. ", ["Let me make a couple of opening comments on Ag USA, and then John would give you the quarter. As we look at Aggregates USA today, I would tell you it is fully integrated and functioning as one company, it's all Vulcan, great folks and great assets. We believe that we're solidly on track to earn our projected $50 million in 2018. Now \u2013 or watch for us and we've experienced some real service headwinds, but we're working hard with railroads to get past those and I think we've kept our customers in rock and there we had to service them. So, that will be a watch for us.\nBut we continue to see significant synergies developing that we're really going to experience until 2019 and 2020, just going to work through those. And I would include in that rail and logistical synergies along with big commercial synergies. And you step back and look at this \u2013 it's all underpinned with really strong demand and price growth in States of Georgia and Florida. So, good start to Ag USA, but I think really the \u2013 and we're solid there, but the real synergies will be in 2019 and 2020.\nJohn R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.\nTrey, just in terms of the math, I think Tom hit it. I mean what'll 1appen in the quarter is we got some of the early synergy capture, and so on a total contribution basis, ag in EBITDA level or what we call a cash gross profit level, a strong incremental contribution that first quarter as we captured some of the initial overhead synergies and other synergies far more in synergy capture to come, as Tom said, in 2019 and 2020 even on that front.\nI'll note and we can talk about it offline if you would like. They don't like gross profit for doing contribution basis, it is lower because of the step up in the asset base and the higher DD&A per ton. So, if you're trying to look at incremental flow-through to gross profit, it'll be lower. If you're looking at the contribution, cash per ton, which of course really matters most, it will be higher."]], ["John you mentioned, I think, I heard you right exceeding $6 of cash gross profit per ton by the end of the year in aggregates, and you, guys, have talked about seeing your incrementals kind of getting back to what we saw earlier in the recovery, which I'm thinking that was north of 60% for Legacy Vulcan and you reiterated your guide.

We're also seeing what's interesting, Kathryn, I mentioned in the comments about Coastal Texas is we're seeing early activity around energy projects on the Gulf Coast, and that is very encouraging.

It's going to be a big win for us this year with those jobs starting. And there's a number of them that start around the state of Georgia, and the state continues to work really hard to get more work out. I would also tell you the State of Georgia still has ground to catch up to be able to get that money to market, but they're working hard on it and they're a whole lot better off today than we were six months or a year ago.\nAs far as the FAST Act is concerned, the appropriations actually increased the federal funding by 5%, that's about $1.8 billion. And Vulcan states were big winners with that. Of that $1.8 billion, $1.2 billion of it, well, almost $1.3 billion of it, will go to our 20 states. So we're enjoying the FAST Act now and we're looking forward to enjoying even bigger money coming from the FAST Act to our states.\nJohn R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.\nKathryn, a couple of just other quick comments for you and others on Georgia. Let me reflect a little bit on kind of quarterly timing \u2013 and you all do a lot of great work on this, so you probably know this. But if we're looking a year ago, we're looking at Georgia, we're trying to guess when a certain project is going to start. Now, we're a little more focused on how well the DOT, GDOT and our contracting customers will get the work done, will they be able to stay on schedule and actually take our product in the timing we expect.\nAnd so, as it relates to Q2, we're keeping a little bit of an eye just on shipping, pace of projects that have already started. But, in total, we feel like GDOT and the contracting base in Georgia is beginning to a little bit catch the tiger by the tail, if you will, and begin to get caught up. I don't know that they're all the way where they want to be. They just got a lot of stuff they're trying to do. And so, we'll just kind of keep an eye on that. But that's really a timing issue, not a trend issue.\nAs you know, the work is there, and as we sit here now, the work has started for the most part, and it's just a question of how quickly we get the shipments out. It's another good example of Georgia, by the way, Kathryn, of a market \u2013 it's a great example of a market where that visibility to public and private, where that visibility links back to pricing. So even in a quarter where, again, due to weather impacts, volumes were down in Georgia, pricing was up a good healthy amount, again, due to that visibility."]], ["Wondering, are you expecting to grow margins in those businesses this year just given asphalt inflation and the timing of getting pricing, and then also material increases on the concrete side? ", ["On margin expansion in asphalt, it's going to be tough. We've got catch-up to do within, as I talked about, the inflationary factors. So unit margin in asphalt, as they always do, when the liquid goes up are tough, but they always catch up and we'll be plugging it out as the year goes along. I think that you will see, I believe, margin expansion ready mix as the year progresses and I'll be more bullish on that, that I would be on asphalt. But I do think this, as we stated our guidance is \u2013 we will stick with it, at this point, and I think we will do that."]], ["And then, Tom, the hang-up kind of executing these public jobs in Georgia southeast for weather-related reasons over the last, I guess, three quarters or so, has that held up the DOTs and kind of related agencies in terms of getting new work out just because there isn't the capacity to survey? ", ["I think what held up those big jobs \u2013 and obviously weather was an impact in the Q3 with hurricanes and troubles going to the southeast, but that didn't hold up the DOTs. The DOTs are still working on \u2013 those works had been letted \u2013 had been let. They have been awarded. And so, they were out there trying to get going. Some of that was, there was \u2013 all of them were impacted by weather. Others were impacted by right of way issues, environmental issues, contractor issues.\nSo, that I don't think was a drag on the DOT. In the meantime, the DOT on a parallel course is working on other jobs and other work. So, I don't think they're in series. I will call it in parallel and the DOTs continue to get better at what they do and what they're doing.\nBut as John pointed out, they've still got a ways to go including Georgia's.\nJohn R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.\nAnd then some of the large contractors now are also ramping up their own capacity and getting adjusted to this, too.\nJ. Thomas Hill - Vulcan Materials Co.\nYes. And they did that in 2017.\nJohn R. McPherson - Vulcan Materials Co.\nWe don't see a hole, but we're trying to be a little bit, I can say, cautious, bit as cautious in light of some very positive signals including around backlogs with respect to how quickly that turns into shipments, but not because it happens in series. It will still be happening parallel and will build on itself and begin to accelerate. Some of that really is why we see more in 2019 and 2020 than we do in 2018."]], ["And just as an estimate once again knowing that this is a little bit, it's art and science past combined, would it be fair to say that the storm-related cost would be closer to a range perhaps similar to the bolt-on acquisitions? ", ["Yeah. Again recognizing, let's call it, there's some art in that, right, as you said. From my point of view, I don't think that's necessarily way off. And let me call it margin not just cost because the storms that impacted our Gulf Coast business so much and Kathryn you know this, it really impacted some of the most profitable aspects of our business. Particularly given the advantages that we have and shipping for Mexico and our service to that broad region.\nSo, we really saw at a little bit at sales and in pricing and in sales mix and in distribution cost and in operating cost throughout a very profitable portion of our business. So, I don't think you're far off but I think it's a little easier to think of as margin impact as opposed to only cost impact because it hits \u2013 hit the business in a pretty broad way.\nJohn McPherson\nYeah, I would add to that that, that if you look at our plan, you see us returning to that double-digit margin growth that John mentioned and much higher flow through. So, while diesel is going to be a headwind for a little while, so will distribution, actually that will end up being advantage to us as we catch up with that. So, I think feel very good about plan."]], ["And we certainly can appreciate the tightness and supply of Aggregates in that market, but perhaps could you explore a little bit more about the rail advantage in the Southern California market and your view of the private construction market since you spent a bit of time on the public side? ", ["Yeah. I would just -- I\u2019ll give you a couple of comments on California, first of all, the California is really healthy going into 2018, it's a market that we're really excited about for not just 2018, but 2019, 2020 and beyond. The private market continues to grow \u2013 residential is very healthy both in North and Southern California, non-res is solid, highways were actually coming off a low in 2017.\nAnd I think the state's going to regain its footing in 2018. We see big growth as you know and highways going into really into 2019, but really in to 2020. Our backlogs are improving on the highway side and actually, the infrastructure we're starting to see a little bit of growth on that how we have structured.\nIt is a very, very constructive pricing environment in California. And that's really through our products, our customers\u2019 products and the construction side of it. Demand for asphalt is growing and now we'll have to raise prices fairly quickly to get over a rapidly rising liquid costs, I think, and with all this, we're very happy with our acquisition in Northern California with Shamrock, and we're starting up a new quarry in Fresno, which is a big, big demand market for us, and these some we've been working on for 10 years. So, you can see why we're excited about California."]], ["I wanted to shift over to just the comments on Illinois, Houston, they've been you know, softer markets for you in 2017 for two different reasons; that how you expect those two markets to play out in 2018? ", ["Yeah, I would call those very different. I think that Illinois is going to continue to struggle. I think the team in Illinois, well, in the face of really tough circumstances from the abandoned market, had been a really good job of executing to the best of their ability and their disciplines both on operations and their efforts on sales, and getting all, they can at what \u2013 what they've been offered. So tough -- just tough duty in Illinois with -- really with public spending.\nHouston I would tell you we're I think we've \u2013 we've made the turn it is you know been a tough place on top of tough economics just as we \u2013 we\u2019re starting to come out of the sink in Houston we got slammed with hurricanes and storms, and just hurt everybody down there. But all-in-all, I think Houston is going to be fine.\nThe highway demand in overall in Texas is very good, Houston including, res is starting from a really low base in Houston, but starting to pick up. Non-res in Houston we see is picking up also.\nFrom a pricing perspective all of Texas has held the climate. We had tough times with that \u2013 with Houston because as we talked a lot about the storm impact but I would tell you that I would expect to see price increases in Houston than actually in most of Texas in April. So, where it's- one, Illinois is going to continue to be tough, I think Houston has made the turn and will see a much better 2018."]], ["Just based on some of the timing of these state level initiatives which is obviously, quite positive and as stats kicks in, is this low single-digit growth on public spending a good way to think about the growth trajectory in 1920 or could we see some acceleration? ", ["I think, first of all, I would call that mid-single digit growth in highways be on \u2013 they will build and we talk a lot about this. There will be a layering effect both within states as they bring work on and as the DOTs mature to be able handle work. They're not just going wait to finish one job where they start another one and then, on top of with interstate, you'll see state-on-state bills.\nSo, places like Texas or Florida or North Carolina where the money is already mature and they're spinning it and then they are shipping it, you're going to see Georgia layer on top of that. After two years, they're starting their jobs and then, you'll follow up with California -- in a couple of years you'll follow up with California, Tennessee, and South Carolina which will also start to ramp up and layer on top of it. So, while it's \u2013 highway is mid-single-digit this year, I would expect it to ramp up in 2019, 2020, 2021 roughly for the next five years."]], ["When you folks say that first quarter faces tough comps, are you trying to condition the market to year-over-year volume decline in the first quarter, and I guess the reason behind the question is it feels like the backlog on the highway side has been building for about a year-and-a-half. ", ["Let me be clear, the demand is there. As you saw in the fourth quarter, where our volumes were down a little bit in October, the sun came out, it was dry and November-December and we had double-digit volume growth. So, the demand is there. That is a combination of core demand on the private side, it is the new DOT work kicking in. There's some delayed work there. So, it's a combination.\nSo, as you look at the first quarter let's be real clear about this, the demand is there. This is about being \u2013 this is about days to ship in the first quarter which is always dicey. If you look back at 2016 and particularly 2016 and then again not quite as good in 2017, we had a very good first quarter weather.\nSo, when we talk about comps as we always say the first quarter is always dicey because you don't know if it's going to be 60 degrees or 22 degrees. Is it going to be snowing or is it going to be sunshine and so? But the underlying demand is there and I think November and December is really good evidence of that.\nJohn McPherson\nJust to pick up and that will be clear we're not trying to suggest specifically that volume in the first quarter will be lower than the prior year. We're simply trying to remind everyone that it is a tougher comp, but it would be inappropriate for us to try and even give any kind of specific Q1 guidance just because it's so dependent on whether in March, anyway. So, it's both a tough \u2013 tougher comp and more uncertain. I take Tom's points as the key things which is the work is there to be done."]], ["Quick question with all the moving parts and as we\u2019re thinking about double digit unit margin growth for the year.\nIs it fair to assume that the incrementals in the first half of the year are going to be maybe a little bit softer and we're looking at a big ramp in the second half of the year in terms of allowing price to catch up allowing some of the easier comparisons? ", ["I'll start and I'm sure John will have some to add this, but as we said and we talked about pricing that it would it would accelerate through the year for the normal reasons of timing of pricing in different markets and then the pricing as a campaign particularly with bid work. So, we would expect normally for price to go build the year.\nAgain, the comps in the first quarter are going to be tougher, they get a little easier with what we saw in wet weather in the second and third. I think that when it comes to operations and discipline, I think we're \u2013 we're kicking in and that will also improve obviously that improves with weather also. I mean it\u2019s easier to operate in in June and July and August than it is in January and February particularly if you're in some place like Illinois or Virginia.\nSo, for those reasons and I don't think anything is out of the ordinary there. And we've mentioned what \u2013 the first quarter stuff, that's how we would see the year shaping up. I don't have a whole lot to add to that other than to just keep in mind we're \u2013 as an industry coming out of a period of sluggish shimmer growth into -- into a sustained period of returning to growth.\nAnd with that shift, I think you're going to see some normal tick up of pricing and kind of build throughout the year. You\u2019re going to see a little bit better operating leverage throughout the year. So, I think it's really kind of as you'd expect probably."]], ["Well, I asked that question in the backdrop of the industry that it typically takes a long time to turn rate positive and when it does, it doesn't last very long. ", ["Yes. Look, I think it never lasts as long as you'd like, and that's sort of reality. At the same time, from my perspective, I think from our perspective, there's still a lot more pain to come. And if you look at what's driving the change, its pain. And we've sort of gotten a glimpse of the tip of the iceberg, but there's a lot of iceberg that's below the sea level and there's just more to come.\nSo, from our perspective, we don't see this slowing, we see it accelerating and at a minimum, in some cases, maintaining from here, but in more cases, it's not accelerating. How long will it go on for? I think that's a tricky one to speculate, but we think that there's a fair amount of runway ahead of us."]], ["If I start a clock back in 4Q 2010, during the last time pricing was driving up growth, it took Berkley about two years to show underlying combined ratio improvement and three years to show GAAP combined ratio margin improvement.\nCan you sort of give a compare and contrast a little bit between this sort of what's happening right now? ", ["Well, my two senses and Josh, I haven't -- we can have an off-line conversation where I can sort of examine our historical data with greater granularity. But my sense is that I wouldn't say we're comparing apples and oranges, but we're kind of comparing apples and pears, if you will.\nAnd so I can speak right now about the situation that we're facing. We have a sense as to what we believe our loss costs are running at. We have a sense as to what our margins are. We have a view as to the rate that we're getting. And from our perspective, when you see the type of rate increase that we got in the fourth quarter start to earn through, while we are not going to move too early, in a vacuum, one would think that, that should -- it's certainly our view that it will benefit our margins.\nBut we are not going to shoot from the hip. We're going to -- as we always do, on day one, we try and book things in a measured way. And as it seasons out, then we will start to recognize it because, again, we do not want to declare victory prematurely.\nBut at a high level, when we look at what we believe our trend is running at, and we look at the rate that we are achieving, we think when the dust settles, it is likely that margin improvement is incurring."]], ["First question, in terms of the discussion around the industry experiencing more loss inflation than expected, do you have a view on whether a large portion of that pain, I guess, per se, will come from the very old accident years due to the statute limitation changes in a number of states? ", ["Look, from my perspective, the change as far as the statute of limitations around sexual abuse, are probably just another compounding factor that has added to the pain. But I think that the industry would have found itself in the position it's in with that or without that, it's just another pressure point, if you will.\nSo, I think that the industry made certain assumptions putting aside the change in the statute of limitations on sexual abuse. I think the industry has been making certain assumptions that this -- what has been, for many years, a very benign loss environment that, that would continue. And I think the industry got hooked on that and I think the industry is going to pay the price for that."]], ["I know in the past, you've talked about your sweet spot, and you've said that where you can have limits, you try to go for $2 million or less and 90% of your book is that of your policies have that.\nI'm curious based on the flow of new business showing up, has there been any thought process in terms of shifting those limits or maybe picking sort of larger account size?

But there are pockets of our business that we'll write some larger accounts.\nAnd we are an organization that is opportunistic. And each one of the people that run the businesses in the group and their respective teams understand the goal of the exercises, risk-adjusted return.\nSo, while our focus is on smaller accounts, and I don't expect that you will see our mix shift dramatically, certainly, there are components of the market that are feeling more challenged than others.\nAnd to the extent we think there are opportunities to deploy capital in those areas, we will do so. Fortunately, we have the people with the knowledge and expertise to do that in a thoughtful and responsible way."]], ["And then on submission flow, obviously, you guys are aware that 2019, Lloyd's as a distribution center or as a, at point of sale, pull back from the market to some extent, giving a lot of your businesses, and look at the business they may not have seen before. ", ["So as far as Lloyd's goes, while they do have a presence in the casualty and the professional market, they are certainly much more short-tail marketplace than they are a long-tail, or liability market. That being said, we certainly have benefited from a change in appetite by many market participants. I'm not singling out Lloyd's. How they will choose to behave and what their appetite will be for the 2020 year and beyond, I think that's a better question for Mr. Neal and Mr. Hancock than me.\nHaving said that, it is our expectation that much of what we're seeing gone in the marketplace where capacity is being constrained, not just by Lloyd's but by many other household names where most situations where there were once willing to put out $50 million, $25 million chunks of capacity, now they are looking to put out $5 million and $10 million of capacity. That is something that is innerving to the benefit of all market participants. So we are clearly seeing a growing number of lines where I wouldn't say there is an absence of capacity, but capacity is clearly tighter."]], ["Last quarter you said it was over 6%, so it seems like a little bit of deceleration, which doesn't match with your commentary about the market transitioning to a better place.

But when we dug in, it's really driven by mix of business during the period. I think if anything and again we have the ability to dig a little deeper than you can. Our sense is that the momentum is stronger in Q2 than it was in Q1, and that headline number I would not use as a barometer from my perspective. Again it's really due to mix of business during the period."]], ["And next, in terms of the market transition you had \u2013 it doesn't seem to me the impetus that you're talking to is coming from interest rates because I'd assume that new money rates for everybody, including yourself, maybe I'm wrong are \u2013 are some of the headwind on the fixed income side.

I think that the investment portfolio for anyone in the industry is not going to bail out underwriting at this stage. Having said that, even if you were in some of the normal or more traditional investment or interest rate environment, I think that there's enough challenge that's coming as a result of historic underwriting decisions over the past few years that is going to drive the change in behavior.\nSo I think it's sort of insult to injury, if you will, but the reality is that this is an industry that made assumptions that some of the benign transit we have seen over the past many years would continue. And it is pretty clear that they are not. Certainly you can see that first how loss cost trends are being affected for the industry overall. And some people were more aggressive in their assumptions, and I think that's proving to be a problem for some.\nWe have as an organization been beating the social inflation drum for an extended period of time will be measured in quarters maybe years at this stage, because we saw the bits and pieces and we started to triangulate off that and we've been concerned about what that meant, which is one of the reasons why you saw us having the discipline? Why you saw parts of our business over the past couple of years not growing? Why you've seen our growth rate reduced dramatically?\nBut now that we're seeing the marketplace responding accordingly, it's given us the opportunity to open up the spigot again though in a thoughtful and measured way. So, investment returns and the challenges around those are not the sole driver, but clearly they are not going to bail anybody out."]], ["Last quarter, you gave what I guess could be called somewhat cautious commentary on your view of worker's comp, I guess particularly on frequency and maybe the sustainability of the frequency trends in comp.

You\u2019ve seen action and you continue to see action by state rating bureaus, that\u2019s pretty aggressive in our opinion. I think it's a little bit early to really reach a conclusion as to where \u2013 what the loss cost trends will remain benign.\nThere is a lot of things that would support they will. There is a lot of data that would suggest that you're going to see a pickup particularly in the frequency line. I think as we touched on last quarter, I'll now \u2013 I\u2019ll reference again in a tight labor market, when you have more people working overtime and you have a lot of people in jobs that they are not as well trained for, that's often time value as accidents and unfortunately people could get hurt and that can lead to frequencies.\nSo, when we look out as far as the comp line goes, we think that there are clearly pockets where there is still opportunity, but we are being measured and cautious. I think that\u2019s really the difference between being a specialty player and just being a standard player. The comp line like any other line that we participate in expertise and knowledge and experience make a difference."]], ["Could you just maybe elaborate and share your view, because it seemed like, at least on the Travelers call, it seemed like a continuation and maybe a bit more uptick in what they might have seen in Q1 to Q2.

But quite frankly, the top-line is growing slower than the rate that we're achieving.\nAnd I think you could probably triangulate off of those data points. It tells you something. Commercial Auto is challenge, it's been challenged for a while when we look at our data and our experience we've had concerns about it for what has been measured in years, which is why we've been pushing for rate as long as we have, and that's why you've seen in that product line shrink, a lot of bit, \u2013 excuse me, quite a bit over the last couple of years. But more recently, we're seeing it grow because we're able to really get the rate that we think we need."]], ["So one way to interpret that is that, since we're seeing more of a firming in rates for the industry and certainly in the casualty lines, if things look bad, they're worse than you think then maybe the era of kind of industry reserve releases is coming to an end.\nWe know that a lot of that has been comp has driven a lot of the releases. ", ["Look, I think there are others that can speak to the reserve adequacy in the industry better than I in general. My two cents for what it's worth is that I think the industry has recognized some positive development over the past few years, which is quite frankly, it's a tough business, when you don't know your cost of goods sold until some number of years after the fact. And, I think, we went through what was a very benign period that the casualty market enjoys particularly on the frequency side.\nI think that there are increasing signs that that benign environment no longer exists not to the same extent and that may prove to create some challenges for the industry today. And the question is, are people appropriately pricing for the legal environment for example that we are in today?\nSo, look I'm not going to predict the redundancy or the deficiency of the industry, and I'll leave that to brighter people than me. But I would tell you that I think that the marketplace has been pretty aggressive for the past couple of years. I think a lot of that has been glossed over as a result of what was a benign cat environment as well as positive development from earlier years for the industry. And I think that at some point you can't keep putting lipstick on the pig as my boss said."]], ["But something that stood up to us was it actually -- the premium growth was the least in the line where I would've expected the most incremental rate, so short-tail professional liability and commercial auto because they lagged down the liability comp. ", ["I would interpret that as underwriting discipline, in places where we have decided that we want rate. And we are -- when you think about sort of the rate/growth balance or trade we choose rate.\nAnd I think what you will see happen over time or at least history would suggest you will see, and I believe you will see as well, is that those lines where we're pushing the rates. You are going to at some point start to see those oftentimes there's some of the lines where the growth rate will eventually evolve to be the highest.\nBut it starts out, in these cost lines where we are digging our heels in and saying we will get this much rate or we will not raise the business. And we expect that over time the market will cooperate. And it's cooperating somewhat and we expect that that will accelerate."]], ["So, I mean not to put words in your mouth Rob, but it sounds like you're saying the rate of environment's better but a lot of these lines are more loss affected. ", ["There's a -- it really depends on a particular product line. So my comment to you is that when we look at the loss environment and we also look at on the horizon with sort of the legal environment, some of the issues we've talked about around social inflation, our view is that it makes sense to charge more in some of these lines of business for a unit of exposure.\nAnd if we are not able to get what we believe is an adequate rate, then we will not write the business and that's okay too. If we end up not writing the business and that excess capital we'll return it to our shareholders.\nHaving said that, certainly the early signs would say that that we were able to achieve the rate and the market will start to bear it more and more and we expect that other market participants will be moving in a similar direction."]], ["If I had to be a little picky, if you look at the reinsurance results, it actually has some volatility and last three years are making underwriting income in these particular segments. ", ["Okay. I think there was probably a couple of questions and maybe an observation or a comment that you offered as well and let me try and take it in reverse order, if you don't mind. First off, as far as the reinsurance business goes, while it is true that it is not the largest part of our organization from our perspective, it is one of our core activities and we do see value in having it part of the organization. It just so happens that we've gone through a period of time where quite frankly the reinsurance marketplace has perhaps lost in general its discipline and its sense of good judgment. And to many of our colleagues\u2019 credit, they were not willing to follow that business down the drain.\nAs it relates more specifically to the results, I think there are a couple of pieces there. One, we have somewhat of an inflated expense ratio, which does not do us any favors and a lot of that stems from us contracting the top line. I think the other piece and we've touched on this in the past that we have moved away from is we had done some structured deals where we've concluded that the available margin didn't make sense some time ago and we have moved away from those.\nAs far as the property, like, there is certainly some volatility, but as you can see on one of the pages in the release, I think our property top line in the fourth quarter was down close to 20% as opposed to the casualty, which is moving up and unless you see a meaningful change in the property market, I think you will see the growth coming from the casualty front.\nSo just circling back to your -- perhaps your last question, no. I/we do not envision a time in the foreseeable future when we are out of the reinsurance business. It is an important part of what we do and that is our position.\nDid I answer your question?"]], ["If I may squeeze into last one, in the past, you either gave out on capital management special dividends or you buy back stocks and you seldom do both, and this quarter, you had both, a little bit of buybacks. ", ["I think as you've heard us comment in the past, we are conscious of our capital position. We spend a good deal of time trying to make sure that we have an appropriate level of capital, not just to run the business, but to be able to capitalize on opportunities that we see on the horizon. As far as special dividends and share repurchase, obviously, those are two tools that we have available to return capital to shareholders. Yes, of course, when it comes to share repurchase, we are conscious of what we believe putting aside stated book value is, but what we believe is true book value or intrinsic value of the business and we take into account where the stock is trading at. But ultimately, when the day is all done, we have a conversation as to capital requirements and then to the extent we have excess capital, what is the most efficient way to return that to our owners.\nSo the answer is, to your question, I'm not going to answer it specifically, because we don't necessarily get into the details or the specific philosophy around how we choose to return value to shareholders."]], ["The first question I had for you Rob was I was trying to tie your commentary on pricing of 3.9% with your frustration with the industry behavior regarding what they are doing. ", ["Well, from our perspective I think it's pretty clear that in many lines of business loss costs are moving up. Workers comps maybe one of the few phenomenon where we're seeing certain components of the loss cost particularly the frequency trends being negative which then annures to the benefit. But overall, when you look at the level of financial inflation in the broader systems and if you look at the level of social inflation that there is a growing evidence around we think that there are lots of ways to affect the rates. Again, one is the price we charge, one is terms and conditions attachment point deductable et cetera et cetera.\nOur view is that given the level of inflation that is in the system and that presents itself in many different ways one needs to be taking appropriate action. So yes, when we talked about 3.9 of rate that is just what's you're being driven by the pricing we are doing other things as well which we think will impact the margins."]], ["I mean in the past certainly Bill has said that that you -- unlike a lot of companies you like to write new business at a better margin then business that\u2019s already on your book.

", ["There was -- we've had a shift in the portfolio and I'm going to give you my key suggestions, then Rich can give you a little bit more color. Rich, that was my heads up, it's about to come over to you.\nRichard Baio\nFair enough.\nRob Berkley\nWhat's happened is we had several structure deals there where the loss ratio had a quarter or cap on it, if you will, and the commission was on a sliding scale. The commissions were particularly high. The colleagues running the business decided pursuing those in general did not make a lot of sense going forward. Commissions came down, scale of the business came down, internals went up. I'm done.\nRichard Baio\nI think that's a fair summary, Rob. The other point that I would add is that as we see, on the commission side as you're pointing out, a reduction, the fixed costs are obviously down a little bit as well. And that reduction is not enough to counter the effect of the earned premium reduction that we're seeing coming through quarter-over-quarter. So it's really just a reflection of that fixed and variable costs proportion to the earned premium."]], ["And I guess my question to you would be, are your expectations of the industry different than what the industry has done over time?Namely we're seeing none of investment income improve interest rates rise where we haven't quite seen losses emerge at any significant scale just yet. ", ["So I'm going to yield to my boss who has decades more experience than I do and I think he can give you a better perspective than I.\nBill Berkley\nI don\u2019t like being referred to as decades. But the long shot to it is -- I think you have different sources of capital that are responding to losses in different ways than this industry has historically responded. So yes, it is different than it was. Primarily because the capital is in this industry for marginal returns over and above their investment returns, there's lots of it. And people are looking at their investment returns in a different way. I think that's going to all change and it will at some point when the catastrophe losses are large enough that it impacts people who find that the unforeseen event is greater than the actuarially projected result. And that will happen, we just don't know exactly when. We have had periods of time where we had 300 and 400 year events in a period of five or seven years. And that's the kind of thing that can dramatically change the outcome. Sandy wasn\u2019t even a hurricane. Imagine if it was a hurricane. Imagine if 38 kind of hurricane came across where it did last time, the losses on Long Island and Rhode Island alone would be bigger than any storm we've seen. So I think that you aren\u2019t seeing people react because they're relying 100% on the predictive modeled results and if you've been in the business long enough you know, predictive models results are only averages based on statistics, they are not perfect. And I think this business has become much, much more predictive than model. As you think it is behaving in a different way at the moment, but we will see whether that's justified or not."]], ["And then I guess the other question, Rob in your prepared comments you also talked about D&O, particularly for large accounts is being an area of that seems especially concerning right now. ", ["Again, from our perspective the D&O space in general is pretty competitive. As far as opportunities or niches within the D&O space, we prefer not to get into where we see the pockets of opportunities. But again, the large accounts and we all read about the loss activity if you pick up the Wall Street Journal you can't help but stumble across it. There's been a fair amount of loss activity. There has been a frequency of severity if you will and that's not uncommon for the D&O space. I think the problem is that the market has been very competitive for an extended period of time, and I'm not sure if there is an appropriate level of premium to be able to endure the level of loss activity, and again I think that\u2019s particularly noteworthy and what I would define as the Fortune 5000."]], ["My first question is on the core margin, underlying margin, if you would take out the cash that\u2019s what reserve releases, looks like is a flattish year-over-year in term underlying core combined ratio. ", ["The answer is we expect that the margin should improve a bit from here. I know that it\u2019s easier to calculate when you start trying to use rate increases, but I would tell you that the bigger opportunity for us is some of the adjustments that we\u2019re actually making to the portfolio, overall certain classes of business that we are deemphasizing other parts of the business that we are expanding. And that on its own I think will have a meaningful impact on the financial results. And what we\u2019re able to do on rate, I think will be helpful but that is secondary to the pivoting of the portfolio.\nAnd one of the plus is of our organization and you\u2019ve heard us talked about it in the past probably forever my father is certainly talked about in the past as well. And that is because of our decentralized structure we\u2019re able to be particularly nimble and take advantage of opportunities and actually get visibility into business at a very granular level and that\u2019s helpful on those levels."]], ["My last question on the investment side and looks like you\u2019ve been guiding $100 million each year realized gains, but you did more than not in a quarter as well as for the last couple of years as well. ", ["I think that we told people $25 million a quarter, because they wanted a number to put in their model. And we felt comfortable giving that number out with a fairly high degree of conviction. And yes, you\u2019re correct. This is an opportunity for us to harvest some gains include environment and we would expect that will continue for a while. $25 million was a placeholder to let people use models to forecast our results. Yes, we had more than that in the first quarter and I would expect that while we might have more or less in the second quarter or the third quarter. We\u2019ll have more than $100 million by a significant amount. We would expect by the end of the year. But again it\u2019s meant as a placeholder, so people can come up with the forecast, but it would be disappointing if this year we do substantially more."]], ["And then if I can ask just one broader question that I don\u2019t think came up yet, it was since the last call, we\u2019ve seen sort of another wave of M&A in the sector. ", ["Well I\u2019ll give you my two sense and then I\u2019ll hand it over to my boss. My two sense is that there\u2019s been a fair amount of consolidation. I think there are parts of the insurance marketplace that are viewed as particularly attractive. And some of those more attractive areas, there\u2019s less and less real estate available if you like. And we\u2019ll have to see what unfolds, but from our perspective consolidation creates opportunity for us as an organization not just to attract talent, but also to attract relationships and insured, because our ability to provide predictability, continuity and consistency to the marketplace is perhaps very meaningful, even more meaningful and other organizations are disrupted or distracted by internal activity.\nBill Berkley\nI think that \u2013 I would add that quality and culture really determine an insurance company success, all things being equal that you have the financial capacity to meet your obligations. Just as we were more than happy to pair claims, as rapidly as we were reasonably able to, because we thought that\u2019s why people buy insurance. We wouldn\u2019t want to do anything that would have an adverse impact on the culture of the quality of our enterprise. And while we look at many opportunities, it\u2019s hard to find things that we think would be a good and useful way to spend our capital that would approach the value of returning it to our shareholders. There\u2019s lots of things in the marketplace. There are many companies that are out there for ways to find new homes. And we look at most of them. And it\u2019s just hard to find things, we think are additive and create value for our shareholders."]], ["And I was wondering if you could sort of sketch that out a bit more and this goes back to the comment you made on the tax benefit not getting competed away on, I guess, the commercial and specialty lines versus personal lines. ", ["Yes. So when you think about at least the space that we operate in and a significant number of our specialty commercial lines competitors, they are parent, if you will, are domiciled outside of the United States. They effectively have had a tax rate that is materially below the tax rate that we as an organization and other peers that are domiciled in the U.S. have had to deal with. So what has effectively happened is our tax rate is going down, and their tax rate may very well be incrementally going up. And that gap has narrowed.\nSo for them to be able to achieve the same results and compete in the market, something is going to have to give. They are either going to change their pricing and raise it. They are going to change their risk selection. They are going to accept lower returns, something is going to have to give. And when I made that comment, I'm assuming that they are not inclined to want to accept dramatically lower returns. So those that have enjoyed a lower tax rate, that is a meaningful part of the marketplaces that all of a sudden are not going to have that advantage in their economic model, I think will be the biggest backstop to this marketplace eroding. They need to with -- they are going to have to figure out how they compete."]], ["If you look at the book where it stands on the reinsurance side in terms of, I guess, the top line, and I think you made a comment that Berkley Re America had shrunk. ", ["I think it's hard to know exactly what tomorrow will bring. At this stage, at least in the short run, I think there is probably more opportunity outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. just due to competition. That could change, however, very quickly. Having said that, obviously, when we write a treaty, it takes time for that quota share structure to come through in the net written premium. So my view is that we'll have to see how it unfolds. But we think we have a great team of people both domestically as well as outside of the U.S. And they know the expectation is to make money, not to issue treaties or reserves. I think the other piece is, that's worth mentioning, we do have a meaningful fact presence. And ultimately, if you see a market that starts to really harden the fact that this could provide a meaningful upside. So again, the division of the business has shrunk and, again, we think that in the aggregate it might shrink a bit more during '18. But we'll have to see what holds for the second half of the year."]], ["If you think about now the tax reform also levering the plain field potentially in the merger acquisition front opportunities as well and you recently see a large commercial player buying up a muni reinsurer.

At the same time, we are cautious and cheap with the shareholders money, some people have suggested. And as a result of that, we take a view that when it comes to building the business, we are very comfortable being patient and building it organically brick by brick. That way it's much more controlled. Having said that, we would certainly never rule out an acquisition if we thought that it made sense for the shareholders."]], ["Rob, I was hoping we can go back to your opening comment about the some of the parts not equaling the whole and it seems as if maybe half the losses or maybe more are missing.

I think the mortgage insurance industry, I don\u2019t know what their exposure is to Puerto Rico, but certainly, their exposure to Texas is very material. I don\u2019t know how the movie plays out, if you sort of roll it forward and you have someone who has the house worth $100,000 or so and they didn\u2019t have flood insurance, the house is trashed and they don\u2019t have enough money, because they don\u2019t have flood insurance to rebuild the house.

So there are parts of our business, particularly in the insurance segment where we are growing and we're seeing great opportunity. There are other parts of our business that we are contracting and there are few isolated situations where we have decided to withdraw from a particular class or a particular line of business in a particular geography.\nI think from my perspective, the market is not a situation where the bottom has fallen out I think that there are still meaningful opportunities and particularly in the insurance space. Having said that, I think there is no doubt that it is becoming more competitive and I think that the rate that people are getting in the auto space is to a certain extent overshadowing some of the challenges that people face when it comes to rate and other product lines.

And I guess my response is to tell me what market conditions are going to be and I can tell you what the growth rate is likely to be. So again we have -- the reason for my comment about not leaping to any conclusions as to this being a new norm for insurance growth, one is because hard to know market conditions are going to be; but two, we have a fair number of things in the hopper that are going to be coming online sort of gradually over the next 12 months or so which certainly over the next 12 to 24 and into 36 months could be very meaningful contributors to the top-line and we would expect the bottom-line as well."]], ["So yes I mean I understand the positives with the realized gains that don't get counted but I guess historically we thought about Berkley is having more steady results, lot of peers because of the amount of casualty business you guys write.

One I think that it's worth noting that we were trying to send a message as you referenced that we think about running the business from a risk adjusted return perspective we think about total return, we think about how we're building value, book value for shareholders.\nAs far as the comment around consistency of results it is certainly our expectation and hopefully as yours as well that our underwriting results will continue to be predictable and consistent as you suggested that has been the view historically.\nAt the same time as we've discussed and you're as aware as we are, we have taken some steps from as it relates to the investment portfolio to with some respect really again being focused on the total return and not just being preoccupied with the operating income number and traditional investment income because again when we've talked to shareholders the message that we've received from them is that is what is a priority. So they change in how we report is merely us sending a message to you and others that this is how we are thinking about it, this is how our board is thinking about it, and in part this is how we've been asked to think about it or we are in agreement with our shareholders.\nHaving said all of that we don't think that we've created quite the enigma or puzzle for anyone to and we certainly are not trying to be anything but transparent. So if you look at the fourth bullet points under the highlights it's pretty straightforward math to back into an operating income number.

It has margins that can make things shift and so with the first quarter, which tends to be a slow start because of Transit Freight and aftermarket and the timing of some of the underlying OE projects, we just wanted to make sure everybody understood that the first quarter was going to be slightly different.

And we feel very strong about the installed base we have and the ability to really partner with customers and support outcomes. Our international fleet continues to grow and we're seeing some of those numbers coming through in terms of our transactional part in terms of our multiyear service agreement.

", ["Sure. I think when you look at it, and we talk about it an awful lot in previous calls, is that there was just some concern at the day of close. Remember in the first quarter, we were only five weeks into the combination, and we definitely had some, what I keep referring to as a supply chain tools that were provided by GE Capital and help the business manage their working capital.\nFactory programs on receivables, extended supplier programs, payment programs for -- on the payable side. And so the impact of those -- getting out of those tools was -- it was a headwind, something that we were concerned about. And I think we kind of referred everybody references that, that was about $150 million worth of working capital concern.\nAnd frankly the team has done an excellent job on mitigating that impact, working to do a good job in collecting receivables and working with our suppliers. And then on top of that, there's just been an overall better performance in terms of -- and focus on working capital management. So all Wabtec contributed to better receivables, better payable management, better inventory management. And then we also have, and I talked about this in the script, a little bit of the impact of some customer deposits that we received on discrete projects.\nSo all in all, it was a good working capital performance. The mitigation of that headwind ended up in a really good cash performance in the second quarter. On a go-forward basis in terms of our guidance, we think that we're giving a good view of a typical cash conversion cycle. We don't see any kind of like one-time benefit or working capital, rather a continues improvement working capital, and really allows us to come forward with that a good guidance number that's materially improved."]], ["And for my second question, Rafael, I wanted to go back that you put in the release and you said in your prepared remarks, you talked about an acceleration and cost reductions and synergy initiatives.

But the bulk of the synergies for the $250 million will be '20 and beyond. I think we're really making sure we continue to evaluate and watch closely our end markets, the various end markets that we serve. And we've been ready to take actions as needed, as those markets fluctuate and we get a positive, we will have a positive news in that regard. And you're seeing the reflection of some of those actions already in our second quarter results."]], ["And then when we talk about -- we felt we were going to have $150 million headwind from factoring and now not, is that mean that we've been factoring now so this is an ongoing benefit? ", ["So just let me answer those two questions first, okay. In terms of the factoring, the factoring, we have not replaced the factoring program. We had to exit the GE factoring programs. So in other words, the factoring provided a quicker turn on cash receipts on receivables. We have been able to -- that's been paid off and there is no more factoring out there and we have not put in a new program in place for those receivables. We have -- so that's behind us. And if we were to actually find and get into a factoring program that we thought was a good answer and attractive, that would be a benefit going forward. But we have nothing that we're working on right now or in our plans for that right now.\nIn terms of the customer deposits, I think, in total, the receipts of customer deposits that I was referring to were about $60 million. And one of those deposits occurred -- a portion of those deposits occurred in the first quarter and the second quarter. But of course, you're constantly kind of receiving and consuming deposits, so to speak, in terms of project performance. But the gross number received was about 60."]], ["And then just as we think about the free cash flow here, the tax benefit that I guess shared to GE in the beginning, does that show up in the $900 million of cash from ops? ", ["So I think you're going to get a benefit from the cash sharing kind of arrangement, where we get the benefit, in other words, we have less that we have to pay to the government, so to speak, in terms of taxes. And that shows up in the cash from operations. But the amount that we paid to GE to their cap, $470 million, will come out in our cash from investing activities -- the cash used in investing activities. So I think to quantify that for you, because I think that would be a good piece of information, maybe the benefit in the second quarter is about $20 million, and I would expect a similar benefit in each of the future quarters."]], ["I wanted to stick on, I guess, on the Freight business for a moment, and it sounds like you calibrated the outlook for the full year from a revenue perspective towards some of the deceleration that we've seen, at least here in the North America.

We're going to -- when we talk about our synergies and the kind of the buckets where these are being achieved, both near-term and long-term, it's definitely coming from sourcing, combining as a bigger organization, leveraging each other's supply chain, reducing the number of rooftops, having consolidated facilities and capacity.\nAnd you can kind of look at those near-term synergies that we've talked about as they could be impacted how fast we move based on our market conditions.

Not only -- our customers are -- will get into shutdowns and other kind of slowdowns in their own production, so it kind of has a triple effect into our Transit business.\nThe other thing is, we have with our -- with GET, there is an impact on timing of service and the underlying contracts and projects that we have. And so right now, it's probably not as dramatic an impact as it has been in the past, but kind of a little bit -- it's still a factor. It still matters. And so that's why we pointed that out."]], ["And just thinking about the Freight segment margins you talked about sequential improvement in the back half but do you expect the Freight margin on 1Q was kind of a high watermark for the year? ", ["Yes. The first quarter Freight margin was definitely impacted by the five-week GET results. A little bit about sales mix and the timing of how they were delivered and recognized as part of Wabtec versus part of GET -- or GE, excuse me. But also, you have to factor in the recurring PPA.\nWe only have about a month of recurring PPA in the first quarter with that real favorable mix, where mostly revenue was kind of delivered for the quarter in the five weeks with Wabtec. When you take the full impact on the quarter, a more balanced, the sales mix in the OEM aftermarket and that recurring PPA, you get that variation on the Freight margins.\nThe way I've been looking at it is, you look at our Q2, we're at about 16.6% Freight margin, okay, once you add back our one-time adjustments. And then if you add back all that recurring PPA, you actually have a margin for the Freight segment that's in excess of 20%, and very consistent with what kind of the legacy Wabtec Freight business has been."]], ["And then Rafael, you talked about international being a bigger percentage of the GE Transportation's locomotive business across the board, could you think and look five years out and talk about regions of the world where you see the greatest opportunity for incremental demand on the locomotive side?\nI think you did talk to some countries that you're currently in, but are there countries that you want to get into?

But what I'm really excited about is, we have established what I'll call significant footprint, and what I'll call all key rail Freight markets. And that speaks to countries like Brazil, Kazakhstan, India, South Africa, and those really have become platforms for us, where we have scalability, where we've been able to work on locally, where we've really grown significantly our share over time. Ultimately, they have become falls that have translated into having a more competitive business, and we're utilizing those platforms to actually export into other countries.

We do have a little bit of revenue and associated EBIT that's been considered in the combination of the digital and electronics business\nBut typically, we -- in our synergy plans, we have put in -- we are focused on cost. It doesn't mean that we don't think that there's great opportunity in those digital electronics combinations, but for the purposes of this integration, we have focused on cost.\nAlbert Neupaver\nEspecially in the short-term, the cost items are what we would expect to see the synergies on. As we go further out, that's where the revenue synergies will kick in."]], ["I think it was a little bit surprising just because the EPS guidance for the full-year didn't change, but it looks like the expectation for operating cash flow came down by about $150 million or so.

We would have typically had a profile where we would have seen a building cash from operations every quarter and improving sequentially and then a strong fourth quarter, which is kind of our history.\nClearly, in the fourth quarter and we're giving you GAAP numbers, not adjusted numbers when we give you that guidance, but you had a fourth quarter that was negatively impacted by the tax payments that we had to make, under the current rules. We definitely, year-to-date, have had \u2013 cash has been used in restructuring and paying for the GET transaction costs.\nAnd then finally, we have working capital performance that is not what we would have expected. It's really related to our projects about how some of the milestones have not been met and things have been deferred a little bit. And so, we're focused now on recovering, on aggressively completing and closing out those project milestones. We're working with the project teams, the local finance teams and the executive office and aggressively managing our payables with our suppliers. These are timing issues. They're things that we will recover on, it's just that the underlying milestones of those projects have affected the cash flow in the year and our guidance."]], ["And secondly, I wanted to ask about the Freight segment and expectations for that segment going forward from both an aftermarket and an OE standpoint, it feels like inquiries have picked up.

We have 100% content on that order. We have another one for 800 cars that we have 100% content. We have another one for 700 cars, where we have total content, but the cushioning devices. So, we're picking up our share of business and business is picking up in total.\nOn the aftermarket side, more and more equipment is being pulled out of storage as you know and that equipment is in lesser and lesser states of usability. So, it needs to be, in many cases, serviced and refurbished before it goes back into service.

Wesley - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.\nScott, this is Tim. Just one more comment on backlog in general, remember, that we don't put anything in backlog until we have a signed contract. So, we're winning orders, we're being selected for orders, we're being awarded all the time. But the timing of when we actually put something in backlog is determined by when we sign the contract, which can be months and quarters, sometimes between when we win a project and when we actually book it.\nSt\u00e9phane Rambaud-Measson - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.\nAnd we have won a number of signed contracts, which are not bookable, which will have \u2013 they will have call-offs, but we have won the contract already, so we are securing the volume for the long-term, but it's not yet in the backlog.\nUnknown Speaker\nTo get the release.

And we are reducing our exposure to certain types of projects, such as the refurbishment project, specifically the UK project are larger train refurbishment projects, where the risk profile is higher than the normal Transit business, where we are doing equipment supply.\nAnd today, in our backlog, actually we have reduced the number of these projects and we plan to flush out of the backlog several of these projects in the coming months and quarters.

We have the widest portfolio of products in industry now in certain segments, as you know we are the number one or number two position, we have very complementary products. I can just give you an example of the largest commuter project in Europe, which was awarded last year, has been won with a combination of Wabtec legacy and Faiveley product, the most of the control electronics were European base were coming from the Faiveley part and the automatic equipment were originally coming from Faiveley, while these were the -- to the famous segmented discs of Poli coming from the Wabtec legacy side.

So I think in terms of our opportunities going forward they're pretty significant in terms of being able to hopefully reduce R&D costs. And at the same time get to market faster with competitive product.

Turkey\u2019s a large market. East Europe, it\u2019s a large market. We have a facility in Macedonia, which we continue to upgrade, which will complement the facility in Turkey. One of the things that we did is with the unit track business which is one of our main infrastructure businesses.\nWhen we acquired that company, it had two new separate locations, and while they were a sort of a short distance apart, there were still two separate locations. They did not offer really efficient production capabilities. And so we invested in a brand-new facility.

So, it\u2019s progressing along pretty well, we\u2019re investing significantly in its technology that has not been inconceivable application as you know from the mass transit side and all the discussions that are going on trucking.

And so, we to deal with that a little bit in the margin and in the first half of the year. The average is definitely 13.5, we expect to end higher, we're not ready to kind of give EBIT margin by quarter. but that's what we have for the year.\nPat Dugan\nAnd then one of the -- maybe we have shown to you. It was, this is the first year we have a volumes up fully integrated budget. Last year we closed for sub-December, we would just put businesses together. We kind of lined up two budgets, that I think the budget that we put together is one that, bought into its bottoms up, it's management team's budget and it's a budget we believe we can deliver.

We took the guidance out for the increase aftermarket last quarter as you know, and it's pretty [technical difficulty] we expect the recovery to be pretty much flat to slightly up as the year continues and grown into next year, which is basically what we have in the guidance today.

", ["As far as the $250 million revenue, Justin, it was not in backlog, it was in our plan. So it was revenue that we anticipated, it comes in really three main buckets, one bucket is signaling project for commuter railroad that is under construction, but has been re-phased. So there was a section, it was -- the contracts were being let in phases through change orders, and there was a large change order that was anticipated that would be constructed this year. So that was in our plan. We are executing work on that particular project in other sections of the rail growth that will be open for passenger service in the near future.\nSo the question of whether or not ultimately our customer, the ultimate customer, decides to build that particular section of railway is a decision that they'll make at a later date, and that's not something that we anticipate in '17 or '18. It was, I want to emphasize this is not a PTC project this is signaling railroad construction project that we were performing.\nAnd the second main bucket is really the freight aftermarket, that is just a reflection of what we anticipated in the second half of the year and we\u2019re not seeing any significant pick up in the aftermarket. So we decided to take that aftermarket anticipated revenue out of our guidance, out of our forecast, for \u201817. We do expect that the aftermarket opportunities will come back, because traffic is continuing to grow. It is a little bit dramatic, some weeks it's 5%, 6%, 7% I think last week it was 1.7%. So again it\u2019s not a robust recovery that railroads many of them reported already are showing good growth and we know that ultimately our opportunities lag their opportunities and we do anticipate that next year the aftermarket business will improve, but we are not continuing to focus that for the remainder of this year. So basically we\u2019re anticipating flat revenue in the freight area.\nAnd then the third big bucket is really associated with -- we have large overhaul contract for locomotives in our plan, and we had more Tier 4 locomotives in the plan. So the mix between, first of all, the locomotive build is down from what was originally planned, that\u2019s as you know in the Tier 4 locomotive, content for us is better than Tier 3 or international. So given that the Tier 4 build is down about 100 locomotives plus this year that represents the remainder of the shortfall in the revenue."]], ["That implies you need to see a pretty big jump to call it $1.15 or so in EPS in the fourth quarter to get to the midpoint of the guidance range. ", ["Justin, you\u2019re absolutely right. We do expect a very strong fourth quarter, and we have high level confidence in our ability to deliver that. And reason for the high level confidence is that we have a backlog in place to be able to deliver revenue required for the fourth quarter. A lot of projects that we have in our backlog are just starting up and will ramp up as old projects do overtime, and those are programmed for about let's say in average of three years. So we have very good visibility about those projects and the revenue stream that you see in fourth quarter. Additionally, our synergies continue to grow throughout the year, so each quarter we have increased synergies in our plan.\nWe\u2019ve been able to hit our synergy targets very consistently, and we anticipate improved performance in the synergy area in third quarter and even greater in the fourth quarter. So those are some contributors that give us confidence in the fourth quarter. One other thing to take into account is I mentioned seasonality in the third quarter. I want to explain that so people understand. In Europe, given that a lot of our backlog in our revenue on the transit side now from an out of Europe, in Europe in August, there is a vacation season. So normally, plants are shut down for the month of August.\nAnd so there is a gap in terms of revenue generation. So that\u2019s part of the differential that exists between third and fourth also. So again, my real point that I want to emphasize is we have a very strong confidence and we have the plan in place to be able to deliver the guidance that we're sharing today."]], ["I'm just trying to get a sense for -- you had a very good first quarter, it sounded like you had conviction in terms of the progression of the year getting to your guidance and then we got this pretty meaningful guide down. ", ["Matt, this is Tim. I'll take that one. Hindsight's always 20-20, but this is really about unexpected delays and market conditions, most of which are affecting the second half; fortunate that this was in the second quarter, but the majority of it is in the second half where we've taken some things out of our forecast like a pick up in the aftermarket and then some of the projects that Ray and Pat have talked about. So in our forecasting is always based on current and expected market conditions and then of course our best estimates of risk and opportunities.\nRay Betler\nAnd I think also, Matt, we struggle along and hard debated internally about the aftermarket situation; is it going to improve or is it going to improve our past guide on previous call. And basically, we want to take a conservative approach because we're not seeing the pick up that we anticipated. We thought it would start to come the latter part of this quarter going into third quarter, and we haven't seen it. So we don\u2019t want to mislead people and suggest that it's going to come when we can't find evidence that that\u2019s going to happen.\nThere's no question that the railroads are seeing improved business, their performance and traffic, their loadings are all growing in the positive direction. You know what we do in the industry, so there's no question that this is going to come. Hopefully, it comes before the end of the year. But at this point, we don\u2019t have evidence to be able to dive -- it's going to happen, so we took this approach."]], ["I am just trying to look for signs as to what we need to look for to get better conviction that after market eventually is going to turn on and again we appreciate that that\u2019s been conservative. ", ["So, as far as our visibility, I\u2019ve said consistently on our earnings calls that and in investment meetings that we have not seen a robust recovery. So it goes up a healthy amount and then it comes down and then it goes up again, and it\u2019s not a robust recovery and it still doesn\u2019t appear that way today. So I guess our biggest surprise was when we saw that the cars don\u2019t start to run up again. So we saw that lot of cars are coming out of storage, they were coming out, some of the car types were actually fully depleted and we got reports that the cars will start to going back up. So that was one issue that we were disappointed in and didn\u2019t anticipate. And it\u2019s not a good sign. It\u2019s not a positive sign. It\u2019s not a positive indicator.\nSo hopefully that trend is going to reverse again and consistently reversed in, becomes the issue of basically by habits and behaviors of Class I. So I mentioned in the past that I think the Class Is did a much better job in this downturn than they did in the previous downturn. They were very diligent about the public that they had in inventory, they maintain that equipment and they had the equipment ready to go into service. And so they really went into service, they did have to utilize outside service facilities like our own to upgrade or overhaul or prepared it for them to go into service, their buying habits that are changing in the industry. As you know, there is some customers that are completely changing their business model.\nSo I think all those things are having some impact on our situation. But again, medium long-term that equipment will need to be maintained and will need to be overhauled, a lot of it is specialty related equipment with proprietary designs and we\u2019ll get those opportunities."]], ["And then just my last question, I think, you talked to the potential organic rate of growth within your transit business for this year, and I think the number was around 5%.

So I'm excited about that process that\u2019s really going to help the opportunity to analyze the overall markets and to be able to, on a worldwide basis, and to be able to look at those markets as an integrated organization. So I think we have an opportunity to outperform the organic growth rates in most markets that we serve, and because of our product portfolio and our technology.

And we have some visibility into how this should play out in Q4.\nRay Betler\nI think, Sam, what we've programmed in the second half of the year is to build out the rest of the PTC -- predominantly the rest of the PTC hardware. We know that the two largest Class I railroads are target into 2018 date to commission their equipment. And the other thing is, as I said, we continue to book a pretty significant PTC commuter projects that we're delivering and are in our project plan just as we have the transit projects that we spoke of. So we have very good visibility on the project but it is associated with the milestones and those contracts and those are two components that make up that amount for Q4."]], ["When we look at the revenue assumption for 2017 of $4.1 billion, I think last we spoke, you talked about potentially a low single-digit organic growth assumption embedded in that, based on sort of where we started in Q1. ", ["Yeah. We're still comfortable with that Allison. We're not surprised by the slow start for the year. We've just put it that coming into 2017. Our expectations are the freight traffic is going to continue to grow, and that we're going to pick up in the aftermarket area later in the latter part of the year. Second half was where our expectations were focused.\nAlbert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.\nMost of the drag in revenue will still come from the transit area. Keep in mind that our transit projects as we tried to explain on the last call, a lot of these projects are queued up and we'll see revenue recognition getting greater in the second quarter and then with more acceleration in the third and fourth quarter.\nRaymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.\nYeah. So, that's a good point what Al explained, that also means projects are three year to five year in length. So, you literally have those programs into revenue plan, and with the great backlog that we have and continue to build, that revenue stream will systematically build as a result."]], ["And then looking at your forecast for your freight business for 2017, are you assuming that freight traffic continues to grow at around that 4% level or what are the expectations there? ", ["Yeah, that's our assumption. We don't have any information to assume anything else. It seems to be fairly consistent. It goes up and down week by week, but it seems to be fairly consistent since beginning of the year.\nAlbert J. Neupaver - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.\nYeah. And it depends a lot on the comparison. I mean that number really is a comparison number. So what we are planning is that the volumes in the carloadings will improve as the year goes on. Whether that percentage does or not depends on the comparisons, whether they are tough or easier."]], ["Is there any way where you can give us a number for and how much revenue in the quarter was from Faiveley and maybe how much operating income or pre-tax income was from Faiveley? ", ["If you looked at the numbers that Pat gave, most of the increased revenues that we have in the transit area is coming from that acquisition. So, that comes out about $270 million or so. Other than that, the internal growth rate is, we had a flat business other than that and there was another small acquisition that's added to that number.\nAs far as commenting on the margins, we typically do not provide that and we're going to stay key (34:35) to that, you have to realize right now, there is a lot of different things happening. We're integrating businesses, so it's a complex analysis. We are in the start-up phase as far as getting and realizing synergies. You take advantage of some sourcing as I said, where we're trying to take a look at tax planning. We're getting synergies here. We're getting synergies as far as duplication of engineering projects. We've got some duplication of actual head count, and we're tracking all those.\nWe had about a 100 as I said, a 100 different synergy projects that we're tracking almost on a two-week to three-week basis, and we've got the whole team involved on it. Those synergies, the realization of them, it will take time and it will grow as the year goes on and into 2018, keeping in mind that we still think that after a run rate in the third year we should be at a $50 million synergy addition to our current business plan. So we're pleased where it's at, we've got a lot of work to do, and we're really pretty focused on a lot of different areas."]], ["So, maybe it'd be helpful, at least would be helpful for me like, can you help us think about the sequential progression that you're thinking in terms of second quarter and then third and fourth quarter? ", ["We've never given quarterly guidance and we really don't want to do it. I think that the statements that we made is that we will sequentially get better with more acceleration in the second half. There is the business model has changed quite a bit. I think traditionally, we've only had, if you go back to history, the first quarter has always been a pretty good quarter, the second quarter was \u2013 very usually had seasonalization in the third quarter because of the European impact and the fourth quarter was going bank busters.\nAnd we still expect to see a fall back in that third quarter because of the European effect from a general business level, but I don't think you'll see much different, and the fact that now we are a project-based business with large transit projects that we know are in our backlog and we'll kick-in as the year goes on. And that's the big change because as the models change, we were 60% freight business and the 40% transit business and it's flip-flopped."]], ["So maybe just to start off with, can you talk a little bit about the business through the first 25 days of the quarter here, just 2Q trends across however you guys want to slice it across the segments, across the components of the segment. ", ["Yeah. I think it's in line with what our guidance has been and I don't think there's been any big surprises, but clearly at 25 days we continue to focus on all the same things we have talked about, which is integrating the businesses and making sure we're hitting all our targets and so, on that I don't think there's lot more we could talk about.\nRaymond T. Betler - Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corp.\nThe only thing we'd say \u2013 we just have an awful lot of pending closure on orders right now. That's probably a positive and we're not seeing any drastically difference between the first and the second quarter. Just little pickup that we're seeing in freight carloadings, that continues, but there's nothing else that's drastically changing other than the amount of I think large projects that we're trying to finalize it."]], ["And I guess what I'm asking is, when I look through 2020, I guess, I don't really see anything that changes the cadence on the gross margin decline, if anything, maybe it gets a little bit easier because you lap transport?\nAnd then it seems like you kind of hit your stride on the expense leverage. ", ["I'll speak first specifically to the U.S. because I think that was the main question. We're really seeing the productivity loop back in action in Walmart U.S. where you get the sales and it allows you to do what we want to do in prices, allows you to lower expenses. The productivity loop is alive and well in the U.S. The mix of our business continues to change as you look at eCommerce growing in the U.S., the acquisition of Flipkart and so that does change when you look at the total company.\nBut as for leverage, I mentioned from a total company perspective, we expect to slightly lever-in Q1 and that just to get progressively better as we get through -- those through the year and we certainly couldn't do that or couldn't make that statement if we didn't feel pretty comfortable with what we're seeing in the U.S..\nAgain we've assumed this kind of sales growth to get that leverage. Sales growth has helped a lot in getting that leverage. But that's how we see the year playing out."]], ["I'm curious more about how the ramp curve in the new stores maybe changing, as you see growth in consumer interest and awareness of the offering.\nAnd then, the second piece of the question on the topic of mix. ", ["I think, two dimensions there. One is the customer enthusiasm for those kinds of offers. And it's a loud and clear to us that customers, no surprise, are really busy. And that, if we can find a way to make things more convenient for them with pick up and delivery, they're all over it. So, I think, the ramp there in terms of how our comp stores will behave in addition to the roll out that we're doing for additional stores is going to continue to be strong. We have been adding assortment over time. Some of the happiest customers that I have come across are customers that can place their back-to-school order and a grocery order together and go through pickup and knockout that list of things that you need for your kids as they go back-to-school. So that includes a lot of items that are not food items.\nAnd then, over time, we just keep adding as the stores learn how to pick categories that are different in nature than food. It's a different situation to go and pick light bulbs our go to pick some of these categories that may not have as much shelf capacity as we have in food.\nSo we have to learn how to adjust our modulars so that you can expand the categories and the items. And I do think that will help mix over time. And we may have seen that already, I haven't been tracking that part of it that closely, but it makes sense that that basket would change shape and the profitability would look better."]], ["And I guess as a follow-up you're running a dual time strategy with the Jet, I guess how would you score your kind of Jet business and serving those urban millennials? ", ["Edward, this is Brett, I'll start off. In the consumer, I think it feels pretty good to us. You see all the numbers that we see, wages are still pretty good, unemployment rate's low, gas prices are down year-on-year. So, there's a number of things I think are still working in favor of the consumer. Like you mentioned we're watching it as we always do. We're monitoring it, and making sure that we're in the right place with the customer. I think no matter of the environment, we tend to do pretty well and are able to react and be there for those customers, but we're monitoring it as we always do.\nDoug McMillon\nThe first quarter is always a challenge, because you got an Easter change, there's weather that's a little more impactful than it's volatility. We got the SNAP moving into the first quarter, the tax rebates, I mean different windows of times, sometimes, they are concentrated in a few days, sometimes they are spread out over a week. So it makes it exciting to manage Q1. But underneath all that, I'll agree with what Brett said they're in pretty good shape.\nOn Jet I'm really pleased with the role that it's playing, attracting new brands. And our focus as we mentioned before is on urban markets. So it's an opportunity to learn and to try new items and different items in some cases that we have at wallmart.com so that's the role it's playing."]], ["Would you expect the 2019 losses to be the peak based on what you know now?\nAnd then as a follow-up to that when you think about mix being issue, when you think about correcting that you guys were pretty active a couple of years ago acquiring more of the digitally native brands. ", ["Chuck, there's a lot in that question. I'll take the first two and then I'll hand off to Doug. On the SNAP benefits, I mean we are clear you know that, we believe that it did pull forward some into the fourth quarter. Again with all the things that happened in the first quarter, I think we did pull that forward, but there's other things that can potentially make up for that, but that's why we've given the quarterly guidance any quarter it can be kind of 2.5% and 3%, 2.5%-3.5% for the year.\nOn the eCommerce loss guidance where we've said that we expect losses to be a little more in this next year, we're not going to give guidance past that which I think probably won't surprise you. Doug you want to talk about the...\nDoug McMillon\nYes, preserving flexibility there, I think it's important, we have never let a digital transformation at this scale before. So we're figuring this out as we go. But if there's an opportunity to be more aggressive given the total balance of the business, I mean we would be thinking about that.\nAdding digital brands we're after assortment, we're after a repetitive customer relationship. And we're looking constantly at various acquisitions. And I think what you've seen from us in the past will continue to some extent. It's impossible to predict the pace of it or the number. So we'll just have to see at the end of the year how it will work out.\nDan Binder\nOkay. That will conclude our Q&A session and our call today. We thank you for your time and interest in Walmart.\nDoug McMillon\nThanks everyone."]], ["So I think at that point, EBIT was supposed to be up maybe low single digits, and now it's going to be down a little bit.\nCan you just tell us if the entirety of that change is tax reform spending? ", ["Yes, Simeon. I still remain -- feel good about the cost management in the business, and we're making progress there. When we've given guidance back in October, we've talked about an operating income range that would be similar to where we had kind of been.\nSo as we step back and we looked at everything, we've decided to make these investments that we talked about, and that's all included in the guidance that's there today.\nAnd so it's -- that one is a little bit tougher to compare pre and post, but when you look at the investments that we're making, that is the difference. But I feel good about the overall cost management side of the business.\nSteve Schmitt\nThanks, Simeon. Rob, next question please?"]], ["Is it -- I guess, is it fair to say then, since you're switching to, I guess, a lower-cost customer to look to acquire, is it fair to say that eCommerce losses have kind of bottomed? ", ["Yes. Karen, this is Doug. Great questions. I think as we look at this year, we're trying to preserve flexibility as we go through the year to decide what level of investment we want to make in eCommerce as we go month to month and quarter-to-quarter. It's possible we may choose to lose a little more in eCommerce this year than we did last year, but generally speaking, we think it'd be about the same level of losses.\nOur visibility into picking costs, shipping costs, margin rates, the cost to acquire a customer and how the different cohorts are behaving as we make the marketing investments is really improving, and I'm excited about all the levers that are there. And we're -- we again are trying to preserve some flexibility to make choices as we go through.\nAs it relates to the brands, Walmart is just a really well-known brand for value throughout the country. And when you get into Oklahoma and Texas, in the middle of the country, it just makes a lot of sense to invest in that brand rather than investing higher incremental dollar to introduce a brand that's less familiar.\nNow on the other hand, if you take the New York metropolitan area as one example, not the only one, the Jet brand is really well known, has a lot of traction, has appeal, as we mentioned earlier, to urban, millennial, higher-income customers. So it's really just a positioning choice, and that choice was made before we made the acquisition.\nI think we wanted to leave our minds open as we acquire Jet to make the best choices about how we use the brand and where we position it. But our thoughts before we bought it that basically become confirmed, that Jet plays a great role reaching parts of the country and selling, in some cases, some brands that are not ready to sell on Walmart.com.\nSo I think what you'll see is Jet will go through a period of adjustment and then it'll start to grow again in the future but focused on specific markets and opportunities, whereas Walmart will be the broad-based, big part of the business, and growing it will be a priority."]], ["Regarding eCommerce and the road ahead, what are your thoughts on profitability and the smart baskets and pricing and how you're thinking about grocery pickup as well as supply chain in the context of bricks post clicks?\nAnd would love your thoughts on eCommerce M&A and on correlated assets as you've been quite creative about thinking about how to build this business over time? ", ["Yes. Let's break it into pieces. This is Doug. I'll try to do so quickly. If you look at this business, look at it for the quarter or for the year, I think the first thing to always remember is we've got this really big and now strong business in U.S. supercenters. Our comp traffic's up. We're in a really strong foundation there, playing more offense than before. So the big part of the company is in good shape and foundationally strong.\nNow we've got Sam's to a point where it's starting to get repositioned. We'll see more traction and improvement in that part of our business. Internationally, the big businesses at Walmex, Canada and even the U.K., which is a big part of our International business, has been stronger lately. So kind of those big platforms are there and stronger, and I wouldn't want us to spend this whole call talking about a smaller part of the business, although it's of vital strategic importance.\nSo now let's click to eCommerce. In the U.S. specifically, and don't forget we've got food eCommerce opportunities around the world, but let's focus just on the U.S. for a second, we've got this tremendous advantage of having the stores and the supply chain that put us within 90% of U.S. customers within 10 miles. So you can build on that to build a strong food eCommerce business, and that's what we're doing.\nLearning how to pick in-store enables Online Grocery. Learning how to pick in store enables delivery, which we'll continue to expand and learn more about as we go through the year.\nNow let's click to the part of the eCommerce business that doesn't come out of our stores. That's where you get into eCommerce fulfillment centers, the opportunity to leverage smart cart to build an eCommerce basket, not just selling eaches. Like selling a television at cost for Cyber Mondays, not all that exciting as it relates to being a way to make money, but driving baskets on eCommerce is.\nSo you'll start to see smart cart functionality move over to Walmart. You'll see us continue to make assortment improvements to bring in new brands, be more increasingly open to not only the Jet brand but the Walmart brand.\nSo as that happens, your mix starts to change, and you're selling a basket and a more profitable basket. To do that, there are times when an acquisition makes sense because it accelerates the improvement that you can make in your assortment.\nIt might take us longer, for example, to do it organically. There's so many suppliers and so many brands to acquire to get on the platform. So some of the acquisitions we've made have been specifically aimed at assortment, and I would expect that some of that will continue.\nSteve Schmitt\nThanks, Oliver. Rob, next question please?"]], ["Where was that relative to your expectations going into the quarter?\nAnd then what aspects of those buckets moderate as you look to the upcoming year such that the gross margin degradation improves? ", ["Yes. Chris, this is Brett. As we mentioned earlier, so the 60 basis points you mentioned was total company, and there is about third of that, that was related to the Sam's Club closures as well as the Brazil eCommerce shutdown and a couple of other things inside of International. So it was -- about third of that was onetime type items.\nIn the U.S., again, there's just so many things that go into margin in a quarter, pricing, shrink, transportation costs. And so quarter-to-quarter, I think, gross margin is challenging to look at and try to compare it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We're going to continue to invest in price. We've been investing in price.\nAs you know, we always invest in price. But we've been investing in price over the last couple of years, and so we're now 2 years into that. So there's just different pieces of it. I don't want to get into specific pieces from a competitive standpoint, but we feel confident that the gross margin decrease that we will see next year will be less than what we've seen in the fourth quarter.\nDoug McMillon\nChris, this is Doug. I'll just add that I think we're getting better at managing our price investment considering all the other investments that we're making. So Brett and I and the management team are watching eCommerce growth rates, eCommerce profitability, store traffic counts and making decisions in a relatively fast cycle on how much price to invest and where to invest it, and we're monitoring what happens when we do that.\nSo we're just going to calibrate this thing as we go through the year. It's one of our big levers, and we're excited about the fact that the investments we've made in the past are driving traffic and starting to get this productivity moving, which is ultimately what we're after.\nAnd one of the metrics that I get excited about and have been for some time now because the team's doing such a good job is inventory. For us to be down in comp store inventory again for the 11th consecutive quarter while shelf in-stock is going up is awesome and remarkable.\nAnd the cash flow benefits and the other benefits are flowing through to the overall business. So on price, we're being thoughtful, we're being strategic. And we'll manage margins just like we do the other parts of the P&L, a quarter at a time, balancing short term and long-term.\nSteve Schmitt\nThanks, Chris. Rob, next question please?"]], ["If we fast-forward, guys, 5 years from now and we see a substantial, I think about 60% -- 67% of your sales are either pharmacy or food, and a good portion of that becomes click-and-collect or even maybe delivered to the home, how should we think about Walmart's profitability? ", ["Yes. Why don't we both -- I mean, you can go first, Brett.\nBrett Biggs\nYes. I think as, Mike -- I mean, Scott, as Doug was saying, we do spend a lot of time as a management team thinking ahead, obviously, next quarter, next year, 3 years out, 5 years out and how we manage all the pieces of our portfolio, and that includes International portfolio, Sam's Club, eCommerce, Walmart, and thinking about how we will manage as this business changes.\nWe know it changes. The customer is changing, and we're going to stay out in front of the customer. And the great thing about our business is we have so many different ways to do that, and we -- and the diversity of our portfolio gives us more options in which to do that.\nAnd I think we sit back and we say we know where we want to be 5 years from now, 10 years from now, and there's a lot of different ways to get to that versus just one direct path. And so there's different things that we can do to manage that over time.\nDoug McMillon\nI think the only thing I would add is that we're learning kind of the activity-based cost aspects of different paths. And I think, over time, if we could, and I think smart cart causes us to believe we might be able to, we'd like to bring the customers into this conversation and help them understand through our pricing and our communication that if you want to buy a single can of corn for under $1, there's not going to be a better, more efficient path to you than a supercenter visit.\nAs the shape of a basket changes, food and non-food, and it goes up, and remember, Jet had a much higher units per order and still has a much higher units per order than the Walmart brand does, you can start to change the economics of eCommerce to be profitable with a unit per order that looks more like 7 than 2 and a blended basket margin that helps you to have basket economics rather than eaches.\nSo part of what we're trying to build with eCommerce, and I think you can see it, frankly, in the fourth quarter choices that we made around pricing on eaches, is that we're really focused on building a basket business because that's a big key to profitability.\nSteve Schmitt\nThanks, Scott. Rob, Next question please."]], ["You've talked about accelerating certain investments, so I'm just curious if you could be a little bit more specific on what those are and whether or not there'll be any lumpiness by quarter that we should consider. ", ["Yes. Dan, this is Brett. The investments that we're going to make are going to continue to change how we work as a company, help us continue to stay ahead of the customer, and those are going to be in the areas of technology. They're going to be in the areas of supply chain, pricing.\nAnd you can imagine, for competitive reasons, we're not going to get into a lot of things that we plan to do, and we'll be talking about those as we go throughout the year. We mentioned we think EPS growth will be pretty consistent throughout the year quarter by quarter.\nThere could be a quarter or two where we make an investment that's different than the other quarters. And if that's the case, we would talk about that when we release earnings. But right now, I don't anticipate major changes quarter-to-quarter.\nSteve Schmitt\nThanks, Dan. Rob, next question please."]], ["The first one is, did you give a number on inflation and sort of the trends that you're seeing on -- especially on the food inflation?\nAnd then the other one is, on fulfillment centers, you're converting, I think it's, 10 of the Sam's Clubs into fulfillment centers. ", ["Yes. Bob, on inflation, we didn't see a meaningful impact in the quarter. And going forward, probably a modest impact -- slight impact next year, but nothing meaningful really next year.\nDoug McMillon\nAnd on the fulfillment side, I would say we're in pretty good shape in terms of square footage and where it's placed. We had these 6 fulfillment centers with Walmart, the 3 we picked up from Jet. And Marc and the team are learning how to mirror inventory in certain places to improve customer service levels and to lower cost. So that's underway, but the physical plant is in pretty good shape generally. It's going to be fun to watch what happens with the Sam's Club efforts here.\nIf we're going to take Memphis as a place to learn, we basically use the same facility, same steel that we use when members shop in the club and pick from those. That's going to help us with speed. It's going to help us reduce transportation costs. And once we have the wrinkles ironed out there, we'll use more facilities over time. Generally speaking, I think we're in pretty good shape.

The other part would be going forward into next year with the increase in the start rate.\nAnd I'll say what I said before, which is we're going to be thoughtful about these investments.

You can see it in the store traffic.\nAnd we're going to continue our strategy as it relates to those. We're not cutting short the eCommerce investments. I think part of what we're doing now is just letting the business mature and learning how to become stronger operationally in eCommerce.\nThere may be a point this year and looking ahead where we want to be even more aggressive on eCommerce marketing, if we feel like those operational improvements are on the right path.

We're happy to have them as part of our assortment and we'll continue to learn."]], ["I guess so James, I think one of the things that investors are going to struggle with this morning is it looks like if you back out all the puts and takes, the company's guiding to a 4% to 5% core OP growth in fiscal 2020.\nI guess can you walk through some of the components of that about maybe a little bit on how the company's thinking about volume growth. ", ["Yes. So that's a good question. So the -- we did call out the operating performance once you take out the headwind coming from the prior year bonus of around 5%. And within that as well, we're also covering 2 percentage point of growth investments, so you're getting closer to a 7%. And then we've removed e-cigarettes, so you could -- actually if you strip out -- these are all the puts and takes, we've laid out on slide 19.\nSo the way I think you should think about this is, we expect relative stability in the wholesale business. So you've seen the very strong performance in the current year. And I'd be calling on a -- something mid-single-digit revenue growth. And then I think as you look at the RPI segment, you'd be looking at probably flat to declining revenue until we see flat line of sight to improve market circumstances in the U.K. And that's the only question mark we have on the segment.\nAnd then in the U.S., I think this year the way you should rationalize the U.S. is, this year we had a contribution coming from Rite Aid. If you kind of remove the contribution, I think we're looking forward to pretty strong script growth is our outlook.\nAnd then secondly, we see continued recovery in the retail business. So, we had a very strong exit on retail compared with the first half. The same in pharmacy, we saw a strong recovery on scripts second half, first half. We expect to see a continuation of the improved trend. So that would lead to a low single digit revenue in the U.S. business. So I think, if you look at the total company, I think we're looking at something in the low single digit revenue growth maybe 2%, maybe 3%. So take out Rite Aid, this year and you get pretty close to the same kind of number. The way, we thought about reimbursement is we've planned reimbursement slightly higher than the last three-year average, and we expect 2020 to be a continued tough year on reimbursement. And we've planned it relatively conservatively higher than the last three-year average and we're not giving anymore information on that.\nAnd then you've seen with the call-up of the cost management program that should give you the confidence that we will have a significant leverage on the cost side to \u2013 so a combination of the solid revenue growth, plus generic procurement savings continuing at a similar level plus a cost program that is really ramping up and gaining pace gives us the comfort that we get to this mid-single-digit kind of range, before the bonus impact. And know, I'm love to give you a lot of insights here into how we talk through this. So reimbursement a little bit higher than in the past, but a much stronger cost program to give us the confidence to deliver this base case."]], ["I'm a little confused in one of the comments you made earlier and that you expected reimbursement to be a little bit better than it had been over the last three years. ", ["I'll correct that. No, no. We actually said it will be worse than the average of the last three years. And you're exactly right. The main reasons why 2020 would be worse than the last three-year average would be, there's probably I would say higher percentage of PBM renewals in 2020 than there is over the following two years.\nAlex Gourlay\nYeah. Yeah.\nJames Kehoe\nSo that's the reason why we've planned that way. But you're exactly right, it's worse than the average over the last few years. Yes.\nAlex Gourlay\nOkay. It's perfect. And what's happening with the commercial and the Medicaid plans? They're moving from three-year renewals to more like two-year renewals on average. And the bigger -- you know that there's been more consolidation that's happened. So that's actually the reason for James' comments."]], ["So as we think about where the store base is going, going forward where you're adding a lot of services Kroger, LabCorp, FedEx, how should we be thinking about the gross profit dollars per store? ", ["Yeah. It's Alex here. Again we do have a successful front-end-business. And I know we've not spoken about that very much today, and that's improved materially from a profitability point of view over the last period. So I think that -- I think you should think about costs coming down from a rental point of view for sure both in terms of as we rent space but also as we take advantage of the fact that we're over-rented today and a lot of these leases are coming towards us in the years ahead. In terms of cost profit dollars, our intention is to drive sales and drive profitable growth going forward.\nI don't know James you want to speak about the rental opportunity?\nJames Kehoe\nI think if you think about it though the first place you go to is the storage in the stores. So these stories were built in a time when a lot of inventory was in the physical location. If you plot out three years from now there'll be no inventory in the stores in the back-office. So that freed up a couple 1,000, 2,000 square feet per stores. So if you think about it the first piece of the development was free because we've downsized the back-office and the storage space. So the impact on our revenue throughput was minimal.\nAnd as we go through each of the partnerships because we're getting an uplift there's a lot of science that goes into this. So we'll be losing -- if you shrink the size of your retail footprint how much you are losing versus you're going to get some uplift from the increased traffic, I don't think you're going to see a massive reduction in the space -- sorry in the revenue as a result of this, quite the contrary.\nSo what you end up with is a more efficient box where you're probably dedicating less space to some categories where you weren't making very much money. You've gotten rid of your storage. You got rid of your back-office. And then you've got value-added services who are attracting different customers in there. And ideally your foot traffic has gone up as a result of that and a more efficient sales per square foot.\nSo I don't think you'll see the revenue. I think Alex is right. I think you'll see the revenue find consistent with what we have potentially improving. And then you see a big change in the rent. And bear in mind that we're quite over rented, so it's a long-term opportunity for the company versus our competitors, we probably years ago entered into lease contracts that were in the best locations, the nicest places and probably overpaid a bit.\nSo as you look forward over a multiyear horizon, we would expect consistent quite material reductions in the cost of rent. And then at the same time, we make each store more efficient in what's in each of the stores. I hope that gives you enough insights on it."]], ["So with Walmart announcing a big push in the primary care clinical services and a perception among some investors that Walmart may be offering these services at lower prices than the competition, I guess I'm just curious to hear your high-level thoughts on whether this may influence your pricing or marketing strategy and/or the timing of rollout of your own clinical services strategy at Walgreens over the next couple of years.\nAnd then on the plus side of this, could the -- just the notion of greater visibility overall on primary care offerings in the traditional retail setting maybe be a net positive for Walgreens and really all the players at this early stage? ", ["Thanks, Steve. Yes. No, we think that it's a good move for retail to be involved in health care as that happens in a place like Walmart in 206 huge successful company and they do it well then we think that'll help us because, we've got a great brand. We think, we've got strong, better community locations. And we've got more focus on pharmacy there and more focus on health care relationships. So, overall, we think that's going to be an advantage to us. And we'll continue with our own strategy, developing and investing in the way that James and I have described this morning."]], ["Retail Pharmacy business remains difficult really for all types of stores and operators across the entire industry, we're getting the sense that there could be an additional opportunity among the larger mass merchandisers in the U.S. ", ["Hi, Steve its Alex here. One of our strategies clearly there is to grow volume and to make our business bigger to get scale. So we -- and also partnership is really important to us as we've said many, many times. So with the market changes and these changes are really -- you can see the number of pharmacies in the U.S. is in decline as measured for the first time for a long time.\nWe are obviously open to partnership in this area. We bring scale, we bring expertise and we're investing as Stefano said in his remarks and Jim said in pharmacy and the pharma supply chain. So we're open. And, of course, we\u2019ll look for every opportunity available providing a mix that makes sense for us our partners and increase the quality of our business."]], ["Can you help us with the way that you run those stores and maybe employment where you could see I guess the revenue impact only 1%, but it is 8% of the store base? ", ["Yes. I mean it's really straightforward. These are relatively small pharmacies. James said two-thirds are within a walking distance of another Boots pharmacy. And the main cost there to be honest is the cost of the pharmacist. We have pharmacist turnover like any company would have and we simply see that as we have been able to manage the cost while retaining quality people that we need to take care of customers and communities.\nAnd remember we learned a very important lesson here in the USA that if you retain similar face of the pharmacist and health care assistants in the local pharmacy then very often the customers will transfer the script to the people who they know and trust. So, this is economically important to us as well.\nJames Kehoe\nAnd its 8% of the stores it's 3% I believe of the square footage. So, that the employee impact is much lower than the percentage of stores. And then the revenue impact is much lower because there are less efficient stores. So, it's actually quite logical.\nAnd then there's a fair amount of turnover in general in an employee base of -- we have 56,000 people in the U.K. But there's a fair amount of turnover and I think we've seen in the past most you manage the place the majority of people."]], ["If I heard you correctly, one of the main key is you keep pointing to is that in order to combat the reimbursement pressure, you'll need scale, but yourself and your closest competitor you guys have more scale than anyone else in the marketplace and you seem to be having issues. ", ["It's Alex here. Again, I think we've said already. The way that we measure the market internally, we are starting to see some pharmacies close. And I think these numbers are pretty open in the marketplace as well. So, that is bound to happen and not reopen. And so, I think that is a fact you can check obviously out there. I mean secondly, you only have to look at the comments from other competitive marketplaces to see the pressure that we are all feeling in the marketplace.\nThe other side of the coin is that, we continue to believe strongly, the community care and the pharmacy, the physical location in the community with the pharmacist available and accessible, I know is a really great opportunity for not just pharmacies, but for health care, all connected through data, all connected with other health care professionals, all connected to bringing forward new solutions going forward. That's why we are so excited about the work we're doing, not just with Microsoft, but with as Stefano said other relevant partners. For example Verily, we've managed as well and LabCorp. And I can assure you the list could go on in terms of the people who are talking to us and we are talking to them.\nSo, we are really confident about the future of pharmacy. We're really confident that the model that we see today will change, driven by new technologies and the same need that customers and patients have always had which they have a conversation with their local pharmacist in their local community."]], ["And really kind of like the question aims at, should we expect an acceleration in pressure for the remaining of fiscal year \u201819, or is the run rate that we\u2019re seeing for the quarter what we should model for the rest of the year? ", ["Hi, Ricky. It\u2019s Alex here. I thing there is two separate things you have asked. So, I will give you where we are as we look forward with the reimbursement pressure. I think, as James said in his prepared remarks, this is a very heavy quarter for reimbursement pressure, and we expect that to be not the normal going forward. And I think he also said that the FEP, for example, in specialty, which is 110 basis points of the reduction, clearly and [indiscernible] that as well. So, there is timing and then there is FEP and then there is the underlying reimbursement pressure. So, I think that third number is the one that is a real underlying trend going forward. Again, there\u2019s always contracts that start and end on Jan 1, particularly Med D. And again, we didn\u2019t see a really much difference to the trends as you spoke about before in Med D, they are really as we saw before.\nGoing to second question on the safe harbor and the changes in the government, it\u2019s really early on. We truly believe in transparency and we really believe in reducing out-of-pocket costs for drugs for patients across America. We support that really from day one, and therefore, we are working hard with other partners in the marketplace to understand how we can bring that forward with the government. And clearly, we don\u2019t know yet what that really means for any players in the marketplace. But we are working hard to innovate and to work with other partners and we\u2019ll give you an update as soon as we understand better the rules as we emerge in the government.\nJames Kehoe\nYes. And maybe, Ricky, if I could add a couple of just facts to that, so what Alex says is correct. If you like, if you\u2019re thinking about your modeling Q3 at approximately 37% of the entire year\u2019s reimbursement impact Q2, sorry, have the entire 37% versus a 25% expected run rate, so it was exceptionally high. And I think as you look forward to the second half, the reimbursement pressure will subside because there is this skew to the first half. The impact of the FEP contract is material as well, because year-to-date, it\u2019s around 140 basis points or 150 basis points. The specialty business will still grow very quickly, but the negative impact will tail off down to 30 basis points. So, there will be quite a material change in the trajectory of the gross margin change year-on-year.\nAnd then secondly, as you look into next year, we believe we\u2019ve planned our reimbursement levels roughly similar to what we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years. And I think individual quarters will always be extremely volatile and rocky, but over a longer term, while reimbursement is a bit over the trend rate this year, we have planned similar levels going forward. But as I said, we won\u2019t be we won\u2019t have this FEP contract next year. And one big thing that did hit us this year and is still hitting us and it\u2019s one of the reasons for the guidance is, we do have a lower level of generic utilization than we projected at the start of the year and that can have quite a material impact on both the revenue and on the cost line. So, it does if your generic utilization goes down, it does negatively impact your profitability. That will be one potential tailwind that we will have, I would say, 6 months from now or 12 months from now. Because of contract changes in Med D, we would expect our generic utilization rates to increase, thus giving us some comfort around the gross margin outlook. I hope that\u2019s given you enough perspective.\nStefano Pessina\nWe have always known and said openly that we expect growing pressure on margin from and from our contracts without customers it\u2019s up to us to find ways to compensate for this pressure. And till now, we have been able to do it. This quote, yes. The, pressure maybe it\u2019s a little higher, but the problem is that we have been surprised by the pace of the three events that have contributed to the bad results for the quarter and for the year. And we knew that in any case the trend was in that direction and we\u2019re preparing. If we can react so quickly now is because we were thinking all the remedies and all the counteractions even before, we have not been probably quick enough in putting those counteractions in place and now we find ourselves a little behind the pressure that we see in the market. But we are confident that as we have, individuate and we have worked for months to individuate all these elements, we are confident that in future we will be able to find the right remedies."]], ["Outside of things like FEP being clearly a specific headwind to the year, I was always under the impression that the reimbursement rates coming into the year were something you guys were generally aware of. ", ["Hi, Bob. It\u2019s Alex here. I think there is a combination of the headwinds that hit us in Q3 and hit is sorry, Q2, apologies, through the quarter. And I think James covered them off and they were as such, there was definitely, generic deflation was reducing, that is an impact that happened through the quarter, branded inflation was reducing that happened during the quarter. And of course, the volume to be honest with you as well was less than we had expected. Particularly, we had a pretty big a very big flu and cough and cold season last year, and it was early and this year it\u2019s been more normal and a little bit later. So, these are all factors that hit us coming into that period. And I think also, at the end of the year we true up with our PBM partners the contracts for the year. And we don\u2019t really see the effect of that true up really until the middle of February, and that was another factor that happened as well. So, it was a combination of headwinds that gave us this unusually high the highest quarter with, as James said, this fiscal year that created this reimbursement pressure.\nI think in terms of our attitude toward our partners in the supply chain, including the PBMs, we have a partnership approach. We are working with our partners to deliver better service, better products, including, for example, improving the ability for us to reduce costs elsewhere in the healthcare system. I\u2019ll give you one example of that. There\u2019s more money than ever before coming on the table for service-based payments, particularly in the Medicare D area and we again are working with partners toward the government to create a more common framework of KPIs that pharmacists can aim for in terms of getting repayments for example in Med D and DIRs. I mean it worked out very well in my view with Optum and United Health, and a very successful Medicare Advantage book of business, where again we got more payments than ever for performance-based pharmacy. So, I think there is a recognition by our partners. The pharmacy is under pressure. I think there is a recognition by our partners, we want better joined op care within the healthcare system and then encouraging us through allowing incentives to invest more, as James has said, in these models and that\u2019s what we intend to do."]], ["And when you think about that $300 million investment in the partnerships, is this a larger number than maybe you had initially budgeted for or has this had been always the number? ", ["No, it is definitely greater particularly relative to rest of our cost base. So, we have absolutely protected and driven more of our dollars into accelerating these partnerships. LabCorp is a good example. We started that off really in the Gainesville area as part of our Gainesville trial and rapidly we agreed to extend to 600 stores nationwide within 4 years. And we\u2019re having great conversations with the LabCorp team about what more we can do.\nSecondly, I would say that the partnership with Microsoft I mentioned already is a clear acceleration of the digitalization of our company along with recruiting internally a lot of \u2013 particularly a Chief Digital Officer. And there\u2019s more people coming in to really \u2013 really to drive the modernization of our platform and processes to become a new retail and healthcare company. That\u2019s a very important acceleration in investment. And thirdly, I would say that we are encouraged by Kroger.\nAgain, I go back to the importance of food, the importance of footfall in our stores and we recognize that we have a very low market share in food and we recognize that Kroger is a food expert and a national food expert here in the U.S. And we\u2019re encouraged with the money we\u2019ve spend in the early tests and trials and we believe there is more to test and trial for sure before we can be certain of this, but we see a reason to move forward faster with Kroger.\nJames Kehoe\nYes. And just to clarify of the $300 million, approximately 60% is on partnerships, the other 40% is on digital initiatives and the digitalization of the company. So, I think about 40% will actually improve execution in pharmacy, in retail, back-office, everywhere, which is the digital investment, and the 60% is specifically on the partnerships. And I think what distinguishes this versus the plans we would have put together 12 months ago would be that the plans are fully funded. So, we\u2019ve actually \u2013 we\u2019re funding ahead of the revenue in the plan, because the targets we give, we want to be absolutely sure that we can deliver upon the long-term growth model and we won\u2019t do that if we under-fund the future drivers of the business. So, it is quite different than the plan we would have done a year ago. It\u2019s just much more, I don\u2019t want to use the word, generous, but it\u2019s well-funded in terms of what we need to get done."]], ["And then secondly, I\u2019m not sure if recent results changed your view on M&A going forward, I know you\u2019ve been focused more on the strategies, but does this change your view on capital deployment going forward? ", ["Yes. On cash flow, yes, we had a pretty rocky quarter and we\u2019ve got a \u2013 not surprises, but we have a couple of headwinds that we will face this year. So, if you step back from this and look back over the last couple of years, this is a business that can deliver pretty comfortably somewhere in the region of $5 billion, $5.5 billion to $6 billion of cash flow depending on the year. Now as you compare 1 year to another, you always have \u2013 you\u2019re always lapping something or some \u2013 of some sorts. This year, we have about $2.3 billion of headwinds.\nSo, I think as you think through a normal level of cash flow, which is somewhere north of $5 billion, we have to manage through cash taxes this year, which are $900 million higher than in the previous year. We\u2019re cycling through legal payouts of $300 million and then we have large movements as a result of Rite Aid, almost $1 billion. So, the cash flow this year will be well below the trend rate. But we have developed a trigger or a plan in some support of our guidance and we\u2019re quite comfortable on the long-term cash flow generating power of the company. And actually quite \u2013I would even go so far with saying as, I think when you look at some of our payment terms with suppliers and some of the way we manage inventory, we probably have large doses of opportunity.\nAnd then the final comment on cash flow, as you look at this year, our cash capital expenditures are exceptionally high. They are about $300 million or $400 million higher than the run rate and that\u2019s essentially the conversion of the Rite Aid stores. So, it\u2019s quite a huge exercise because we took on 1,900 stores. As you saw from Alex, we are raising the store closures to 750, but that still leaves the conversion of 1,200 stores. And by the way, the Rite Aid acquisition has gone extremely well. The return on investment is exactly where we wanted it to be. We\u2019re getting there in a different way and actually we\u2019re very encouraged by the retention we\u2019re getting as we optimize the stores. So, cash flow this year will be somewhat problematic, but we\u2019re quite confident on the future outlook."]], ["Can you remind us of your strategy in specialty pharmacy, is there an \u2013 is this an area where you could build up further in terms of your capabilities there, as well as, I think you updated us on the Prime and Express relationship, but also do you think you\u2019re competitively positioned in specialties? ", ["Yes. So, hi, it is Alex here. And I think as I said before, we are investing in community pharmacies in particular. These are ones which are very close to the specialist doctors and often also very close to hospitals where specialist doctors operate. And that\u2019s going really well for us. And we\u2019re also investing in our relationships with AllianceRx. And, of course, we\u2019ve set a buying group effectively with Express Scripts. So, we\u2019re very active in this space. We know it\u2019s 50% in the market going forward. We know this is where the innovation is coming from our pharmaceutical partners.\nAnd we continue to work with them on potential new models of how you can actually take the drugs and more precisely and more directly to these patients, who require these not only very, very important drugs, but it\u2019s more personalized drugs. So, we are working on all fronts. It\u2019s a really important thing for us and we are investing what we think in the future of this model. And I go back to again, we think the central fill here is important, but it\u2019s not the only way that you can bring these products and these very important drugs to the marketplace."]], ["And leveraging your LabCorp relationship, what more could you potentially do there, potentially under contract research side with clinical trials and what sort of extensions do you contemplate with that LabCorp relationship? ", ["Obviously, our relationship with LabCorp is really strong. And also we\u2019ve built in Walgreens Boots Alliance, in our development function, what we call, Fine Care, which really is a platform for being able to attract, engage customers in their own healthcare, both episodic and long-term chronic conditions and we have launched a number of different solutions there. So, we think that the platform of the pharmacies with LabCorp along with the digital platforms we are building will give manufacturers a lot of new opportunity to engage with us in different ways. And one of the ways they can engage with us is speeding up their really important innovations to the marketplace. The wholesale business under Ornella\u2019s leadership has fantastic relationships globally with the biggest manufacturers across the world. And you can be assured that we are in conversations to try and join up, how do we bring the right patients, every stage of the development of these drugs to our partners in the marketplace, so we can speed up delivery of new innovations and reduce costs in healthcare."]], ["So, James, you talked about being able to cut some technology costs, but as we think about the potential changes with this rebate rule, it potentially could put it in the hands of the retailers to now have to do point-of-sale and then figure out a charge back, et cetera. ", ["I will take a shot and maybe pass it over to Alex. We think, yes, we need incremental investments, that\u2019s why we mentioned this $300 million a year, 40% would go on digital. We have two large programs going on in the U.S. right now, one is retail finance transformation, which effectively is the front of store plus all the back office, and the program is going well and would be complete in 20 \u2013 end 2020. And then what we call our RxRenewal, which is a renewal of all of the pharmacy systems and that\u2019s a longer program, that\u2019s much more integrated with the digital journey we\u2019re on and that will take a number of years. These are fully funded in any guidance we\u2019ve given and they are quite transformational in terms of the way the company will operate. And we will obviously leverage them to reduce cost to fill across the company, back office, but equally so to engage more deeply with the consumer, the front-of-store and with patients as they come in for the pharmacies. So, it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s like a win-win across the entire company.\nAlex Gourlay\nAnd this is Alex here. Yes, specifically looking at how do we get a transparency in the point-of-care, both the doctor\u2019s office and also the pharmacy and to have that more open network. And our work \u2013 as you remember, early on, we did some work with what\u2019s formely called Valeant, now with Bausch on creating a new model, a direct to pharmacy model for a cash payment. So again, we\u2019ve been working this opportunity for 3 years now I think it is and we remain convinced that these models will be very important to the future as more demands are placed on price visibility and more patients are paying more and more out of pocket for the drugs."]], ["And I know Stefano you made the comment that you have to pay the right price, but there has been talk historically about would it make sense for you to buy the rest of Amerisource, are there ways that you want to build the relationship in the healthcare neighborhood, right?

We are open to any kind of partnership which makes sense, which is compatible with what we are doing provided the price is correct and provided that the organization of the company that we buy or that we merge is compatible with us, because the price is very important, but also if you don\u2019t have a compatible teams at the end the merger will not work and you will not be able to deliver synergies.

We have to reorganize them and reshape them over the next 5 to 10 years and we are on the journey to do that."]], ["I guess, coming off of obviously what\u2019s a very disappointing period, as you try to sort of ring-fence some of these risks particularly around reimbursement and just pricing and then incorporated your view on again some of the policy changes, I guess, how did you sort of build confidence that mid-to-high singles was sort of the correct range and sort of the correct goal? ", ["Yes. So maybe let me cover first the back half and then I\u2019ll move on to the 3-year. As you look through the back half, we did say that the peak and the issue on gross margins in the pharmacies in Q2, we do expect some continuation into Q3 and then an improvement in Q4. So, as you plot out your quarters, I would assume a fairly even split in the EPS between the 2 quarters, maybe 49, 51. So Q3 will be worse and Q4 will be improving. We actually \u2013 we set ourselves a different goal when we pulled together and it\u2019s not really guidance, it\u2019s a growth model. And we set back and we went through very, very detailed reviews with each of the business leaders and here is the goal we set ourselves. We wanted a set of realistic goal, mid-to-high single-digit. We spent a lot of time on the levers to offset reimbursement particularly on the assumptions around generic deflation and the ability of our generic purchasing organization to deliver significant offsets.\nAnd we\u2019re comfortable that the generic team can offset approximately 50% to 60% of the reimbursement impact. Then we went through each single volume assumption, particularly pharmacy, but also in the retail business. And really don\u2019t want it to be lost on the audience the changes we\u2019re making in retail. And one is, this business went from a loss-making business 3 years ago to quite a profitable retail business now. So, we are from a starting point to a position of strength, but with a weak top-line delivery. And the big change will be, we will distort and refocus our resources on Health & Wellness and Beauty, and that\u2019s where we can win and we know we can win and are very attractive businesses. And then we will build partnerships with companies like Kroger to address the other parts of retail and we\u2019re very convinced that we have line-of-sight to improving top-line.\nThe second part is, we said, can we let\u2019s put in what we can control and you can control your cost journey and we\u2019ve built in $1.5 billion. We\u2019ve put a strong governance around it and we will be resolute in delivering and I emphasize, at least $1.5 billion of cost reduction. So, that has a high degree of probability. And then the final thing which we said at the beginning was, it\u2019s not \u2013 you can\u2019t cut yourself the glory. So, we built in the investments required to drive the top-line. So, we have the right investments, $300 million a year, which \u2013 it adds up to $1 billion of investments behind partnerships and digital. So, we\u2019re investing to make sure especially that the U.S. business has the ammunition required to create that omni-channel experience in both pharmacy and in retail, so that we do get the volume delivery that creates the virtuous cycle. And that\u2019s the reason why we are actually quite confident that the growth model for the 3 years is founded in a lot of fact and actually it\u2019s quite a detailed plan we\u2019ve developed internally.\nAnd the question we\u2019ve got earlier, does it translate the cash, and the answer is yes. We see a line-of-sight and consistently deliver in that $5 billion type range that we\u2019ve done in the past. We see no reason why the business can\u2019t do something similar into the future. And I say what Stefano said in the past, we\u2019re very disappointed with the quarter and the requirement to take down guidance and that\u2019s made us resolute that we\u2019ve put in place very tangible plans to make sure we don\u2019t have to do that again and that\u2019s the commitment from the management team.\nGerald Gradwell\nThank you. And I\u2019m afraid, we are now out of time, it\u2019s better place to end. So, we \u2013 obviously, I know a lot of you didn\u2019t get to ask questions on the call, the IR team here are available for the rest of week to answer any questions you may have. And we will look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Thank you very much indeed. Krista, would you like to close the call?"]], ["Hi thanks good morning everybody so last quarter you talked about at least 3.5% core operating profit growth within the overall EPS growth guidance of plus 7% to plus 12%, I guess, I\u2019m just curious given the minus 4% profit decline just posted here in the fiscal first quarter it can be assume you could still hit the low end of that target for the full year?

But we\u2019re less preferred by the 3% in the quarter because we\u2019re cycling through or cycling through some tough distortions as you look forward, we think the plan will be as what I said in my comments will be somewhat back-end loaded and all I suggest you do is, go look out the a solution of operating income by quarter in the prior year last year we had a very strong first-half and somewhat weaker second half so we feel more comfortable in the second half because we\u2019re going to lapping quite low operating income growth in the second half and actually quarter one and quarter two, we delivered average operating income growth last year of 5% so we\u2019re lapping some fairly high numbers in the prior year period so but as all I\u2019m saying is this is how you should maybe think about at first-half, second half and we have an easier comparison when we get into the second half of the year but in terms of guidance we\u2019re just confirming we didn\u2019t do a re-plan on the basis of quarter one we feel comfortable, we understand the quarter one progression and we have some distorting items year-on-year that make the quarter messy to present, but it doesn\u2019t push us off track on any of our goals so thanks.\nStefano Pessina\nSteve, and the remind you that we have never missed the guidance."]], ["And also, can you just confirm maybe in terms of percentage points or some other variable, just how much you know savings maybe recognized in fiscal 2019 from this new cost cutting program within the guidance?

", ["Yes, it\u2019s Alex here, yes. So, I mean I think the reimbursement pressure in the UK had been consistent for years, I would say, I have a lot of experience there and this is no exception. I think the thing that\u2019s different a little bit is that for the first time we have seen description items actually flat to slightly down in the marketplace.\nI think governments also be now working to take items off the national formula that used to be on it and asking customers to pay for it and over the counter. So, I think that\u2019s probably the one change we have seen in the last period, which again contracts volume. But the thing to remember on the positive side there is a global sum in the UK which is our main business. And on top of that, the global sum is shared amongst those with a registered pharmacy. So therefore, overall, we can manage quite a straightforward formula, which is that we know that we are going to have to become more efficient year after year after year. And it\u2019s a pretty steady trend going forward. The big issue in the retail international business this time was really the performance directly of our retail business. And as I think James described very well in prepared remarks about half that issue was driven by market conditions. As James said, we actually are getting more comfortable with our performance in terms of market share and we believe in the measured market, we grew market share in the quarter. But obviously the market is very down, the other half of the issues in retail international business in the UK was driven by one-offs and James described them really well, we have payment changes from the NHS payments. It\u2019s actually a timing issue. We had a change in loyalty. We [are looking for] loyalty which was an official change that we followed. And thirdly, we had the sale of BCM. So again, I think Boots contract manufacturing all of these were the other say they...\nJames Kehoe\nJust to emphasize that I want to be clear on pharmacy, year-on-year in pharmacy is entirely due to generic drugs shortages in the prior year that artificially boosted the prior year, we are not losing share and actually we have no reimbursement pressure, because the UK government has confirmed year-on-year funding across the broad industry. And then if you go to the retail business in the UK, we gained share in all four categories. Now, the problem is the category declines accelerated in Q4 and that\u2019s something we are watching closely. It\u2019s been a very weak season in the last few months and you can read it in all the headlines in the UK, but I want to emphasize our share is quite strong in the UK.\nAlex Gourlay\nAnd also in terms of actions, James mentioned obviously the cost program, which will be important and secondly, we are really at re-imagining our beauty offer. We have new products and new brands coming in, in the future that we have signed up. And of course, as Stefano has mentioned and James mentioned, the digitalization of it, it\u2019s a big opportunity as well."]], ["As you think about all the various ones and the various different stages they are in and Stefano, I know you said you think 3 to 5 years is your kind of intermediate timeline for the store transitioning. ", ["Well, they will start to contribute when we will be able to hold them over in quantities. Of course, if we have 15 stores or 20 stores they will not \u2013 the contribution will be there, but it\u2019s really small. When we will have thousands of stores, we will start to see the contribution. For instance, for FedEx, we have a contribution which is of course is not the billions, but it\u2019s significant. And this will be the case for all day partnership that we will be able to allow once we will be convinced that these partnerships are profitable. And this is why it takes some time for us to test a partnership, but we are not trashing, we prefer to wait, but to be sure that the partnership is profitable, because we have to invest a certain capital to expand those partnerships to many, many stores and of course we want the usual return on our capital. So at the end those partnerships will have a significant contribution to what we do direct, not just indirect as Alex was saying that of course it will be also important, but direct contribution."]], ["Can you share your thoughts on commentary out of Washington as well as some of the other commentary from pharmaceutical manufacturers related to branded price and inflation trends in your exposure overall to that metric. ", ["Yes, sure. I mean, I think the market numbers are quite clear. The level of branded inflation has reduced in over the last periods and that\u2019s continued and also we think that will get into \u2013 that seems to be continue into future as the political pressure and the consumer pressure to go on plays out. With generics, again, we\u2019re seeing less deflation, but there\u2019s still a deflation at marketplace. So clearly both of these together adds a little bit to reimbursement pressure, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re used to and it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve planned for in our guidance.\nStefano Pessina\nYou have to remember that in the end our job is to distribute to deliver prescription and to distribute drugs. So at the end we\u2019re remunerated for these kind of job and even price if will go down, we will have in any case a level of remuneration for what we do. So overtime the market whatever the price is the market will level and we will remunerate for the work that we do for our job. I don\u2019t say that we are independent on the price of the drugs, but we are less dependent than other players."]], ["So strip away Fred\u2019s, strip away all the things that are kind of one-time, what are your thoughts around how you see that business growing just in the face of reimbursement and other issues? ", ["Yes. I\u2019ll just give you my thoughts, and then I\u2019ll ask Alex to maybe add onto this. I think if you look at the full-year, our adjusted operating income growth on the corporation was 2.9% and the U.S. business over 3%. And for a business that size in a complicated industry with a lot of pressure on reimbursement, that\u2019s pretty solid results. So \u2013 and the starting base is pretty strong here.\nSo I think as you look forward, we\u2019ve got Rite Aid for an additional couple of periods next year. We got some new file buys coming in. We got a lot of operational excellence, and I don\u2019t want to discount all of these partnerships and the benefit they\u2019re going to bring generally in terms of a halo and our importance in general in the industry.\nSo that\u2019s where we play up. It\u2019s more a three-year horizon. And then in the short term, you\u2019ve got reimbursement pressure, and I don\u2019t want to start guiding to the pressures. But effectively last year, we offset about 70% of the pressure through generally procurement and others such as procurement activities.\nSo what\u2019s left to offset is about 30% through overhead management. And I think, you\u2019ve seen enough data points, and I\u2019m repeating a little bit what I said at the start. I think, you\u2019ve seen enough data points to show that neither of these tools is new to the company. I just see coming in with a fresh set of eyes. I look at things a little bit differently, and I\u2019ve toured many countries.\nI actually see that we could be a little bit more aggressive on the SG&A and procurement in general. I think, we\u2019ve got good skill sets, but I think are they at world-class levels? No, they\u2019re not. So I think the job that management has to do is make all of these world-class quickly. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m actually feeling quite good about the main business. It\u2019s not an easy business, don\u2019t get me wrong, because of the reimbursement. But I think the tool box we have is quite well-developed and we can scale it up even more. I don\u2019t know, Alex.\nAlex Gourlay\nYes, Lisa, I think, the core driver for the underlying base business is prescriptions, as you know. And even this year, where we\u2019ve had going from preferred to non-preferred for the Aetna book of business in one single year. We\u2019ve been able to grow overall 3.5% items worth through the whole year, and you\u2019ve seen a sequential improvement of 1.3% in this quarter.\nSo even in what was a more difficult year for the underlying business, we\u2019ve been able to grow at or beyond the market underlying. And on top of that, there\u2019s a lot of that dislocation in the market. There\u2019s a lot of businesses who are looking to move away from pharmacy and we\u2019re able to pick up the file transfers you\u2019ve seen from different companies.\nSo we think that the core business is strong in the way that James has described. The volume is strong. We think we\u2019ve done a good job in the front-end in terms of shifting the emphasis to become more of a health, beauty, wellness expert. And there\u2019s a lot more to go, and it may be taking us longer than we had first anticipated. But the signs are very clear, where we\u2019re heading to and the transition is well underway.\nAnd in the U.S., that\u2019s the core of the business along with SG&A. That\u2019s the core of the business. So I think, we believe the core is strong. The market is challenging, but we\u2019re very well-equipped to deal with it.\nJames Kehoe\nAnd Alex mentioned it a little bit earlier, don\u2019t underestimate the positive impact on operational excellence from new systems investments, and we\u2019re spending significant amounts of money in the U.S. business, both on the financial systems, store systems, stock availability. It\u2019s just an enormous amount of positive momentum that will be brought online in the next couple of years, and this will all produce effectiveness in store and actually in the back office as well. So it\u2019s a multi-year cycle unfortunately, and we have to go through it. But two years from now, it will be a very different animal in terms of the ability to execute.\nStefano Pessina\nLisa, Stefano, Lisa. For years, we have been told, \"Is your model sustainable? Will you be able to reduce cost for ever? Will you be able to buy better forever? And you see year-after-year, we are very, very delivering. Look at what we have done since the first day that we are here.\nWe have always given guidance. You can judge by yourselves whether our guidance were correct or not and where we ended up. At the end, we see guidance. So I\u2019d say that we continue to deliver what we promise. And if we tell you that we believe that there\u2019s still a long way to go in our \u2013 for our costs for our buying power. Well, at the end we have demonstrated that when we promise something, we do it so."]], ["And I\u2019d be interested to hear your thoughts on how expansion of such a strategy might impact pharmacy and the opportunity with a generic and, of course, a little more limited with an authorized generic? ", ["Hi, Eric, it\u2019s Alex here. Yes, I think, again, we are very open to anything that reduces the cost for the customer and provides access to care and very important molecules, because we are absolutely focused on the customer and what the customer wants. So we think overall, this is a good move for the industry. Economically, it\u2019s a small impact on us and one that we can absolutely manage going forward. And I think, it will be interesting to see what happens with other molecules of similar types.\nSo this is the move to these generics has been happening in the U.S., as you know, for years and years and years. The penetration of generics overall is about 90%, and I think overall and it\u2019s just a further example of our trend. So it\u2019s good news for the customer. I believe it\u2019s good news for Walgreens pharmacy overall, and we\u2019ll remain very competitive as it shifts in the marketplace."]], ["And maybe why I would ask is, with respect to gross margin, as you look at the headwinds you felt over the course of the year and gross margin this quarter was lower than we expected. ", ["Yes. The only one I would \u2013 the most significant one and significant one is about 170 basis points as a result of specialty, and it was somewhat higher in Q4 and the earlier part of the year was around 150 basis point. So not a big deal. So talking about 170, it will repeat in Q1 and then it will tail off in the rest of the year.\nSo if you build out your projections, the business will continue to grow really quickly. But the actual margin impact in Q2, Q3, Q4 just tails off, because we\u2019re lapping the big FEP contract. So that\u2019s the primary one in gross margin. I think, you won\u2019t go wrong if you just adjust for that one.\nAnd if you look at, I mentioned before in the comments, if you look at \u2013 you plot reimbursement at whatever your estimate is and you assume the majority of it is offset either through procurement of generics or on the SG&A side. So that\u2019s kind of like the model as you might want to work through the quarters.\nJust in general, our business is not that seasonal. So we have \u2013 we estimate we\u2019ll have something like between 49% and 50% of the years in the first-half, and then somewhere around 21%, 22% is in Q1, and it\u2019s always kind of like that. If you go back over three years, it\u2019s got \u2013 it\u2019s relatively predictable. So you won\u2019t go too far wrong. If you look back on 2018 or 2017 and plot it out, you\u2019ll get a good indication for the phasing.\nNow, individual quarters will be lumpy and Q3 was a \u2013 Q4 was a lumpy quarter. We had phasing impacts on reimbursement contracts, which are enormously difficult to predict. And that, that gives you a 30 basis point impact in the quarter. It won\u2019t repeat. So I think that we\u2019ve given enough insights, probably a lot more than the past in terms of how to think about next year. So I really don\u2019t want to go any further than that."]], ["Because it seems like we saw, at the gross \u2013 adjusted gross profit line, like a big step down either in the contribution from Rite Aid or erosion in the core.

We\u2019ve also mentioned that we have some timing issues in the quarter.

With 4% so far this year, as you know, underlying on the 7% last year, so \u2013 and we continue to really grow share in pharmacy, 300 basis points since WBA was actually formed, so we feel pretty good record market share to a 2.4, albeit in this quarter, driven by non-organic through an organic growth.\nAnd in terms of in the quarter, we saw the gains we had with strategic partnerships with Prime and with United, balanced out by the loss we had at Aetna specifically in terms of that moving from \u2013 structured from preferred to non-preferred. And I think, as James said in his prepared remarks, we are feeling okay about the selling season for 2019 in Med D, and we have the extra volume coming in from Rite Aid next year as well. So one of our key strategies is to consolidate volume and grow volume and we feel good about that over the long-term.\nSo I think script volume is more affected by the Aetna business than we had expected, but underlying, we feel pretty confident going forward and continue to drive good value to the marketplace and partnerships continue to grow rather than decline outside of that particular partnership. In terms of margin, I think we said before about 190 basis points due to specialty business, more or less. 180, due to specialty business, and that\u2019s through the major bulk of the situation in the margin along with the cost, the SG&A cost and mix within the Rite Aid business. Remember, we had two months of Rite Aid acquired in the quarter, which was obviously an impact to that margin.\nJames Kehoe\nThis is James. So just to confirm that, the margins in the U.S., gross margin were down 140 basis points in the quarter. And that's entirely 190 basis points due to the specialty business, and as you look at the growth profile in the U.S. business, if you take out the Rite Aid growth plus the Prime business, the actual organic sales were up 6% in the quarter, which is quite impressive actually. However, the majority of the growth this quarter came out of the actual specialty business, and this created the adverse mix on the margin, but the margins on the specific businesses are fine. The issue is we have a mix impact in the quarter."]], ["And Stefano, obviously when we think about the environment, when we think about the convergence of those, the digital aspects first and the traditional brick-and-mortar, so from your perspective, does Amazon move \u2013 as and move as you know also focused on the patient population that is a high user of drug is more kind of a chronic population.

Going forward, as we said before, we still expect to grow in the back half of the year and also we expect to grow going forward. We have seen some additional marketing activities from some of our competition which again is impacting some of the volume, this is pretty much as we said and we're very confident -- we are in a really strong comparative position, not just for this year but the future as well.\nAnd of course, last but not the least, very importantly, the smooth transfer of the rating businesses that we have purchased to ourselves, of course again is growing on volumes in the second part of this fiscal and calendar year."]], ["And second of all, when we looked at your front end comps, of the door down 0.27 in the quarter, but how should we think about the impacts from your decision to rationalize SKUs?

But we expect that pharmacy experiences to get better which should help us from an efficiency point of view and a customer care point of view, but clearly, we'll see what happens when our colleagues in the industry rollout these initiatives.\nOn the front end comps, we have been consistent in saying and I think the number we gave today about the 300 basis points is the one important data point that we are driving for profitable growth. Part of that was a significant SKU reduction in the bottom quarter over stores last year and I don't have any specific data to give you today but we are pleased with the performance of these stores and are moving that thinking on as an important part of simplifying our offer, both for people who serve as customers. But also importantly, for customers who wanted to actually have a really good experience some more gains as well.\nSo one of the things we have seen is good improvements in MPS as a result of that work.

", ["Hi John -- hi Brian, sorry, it's Alex here. I think that -- we're really pleased with the tests we have. It's a strong model, it's a good brand. It's really link, to be honest, to know the success of this. So far, so good, then we'll update you when we have more information and more confidence in the overall model. It would make sense, from a customer point of view, that you can pop into a convenient location, that we have the, a, corners across America, everybody knows that, the best corners in America.\nSo it makes sense from a customer and patient point of view that you can go in and get yourselves sorted, when you have an accident or when you need a medical or something of that type, which is what MedExpress does.\nSo, so far, so good, but very early on and related to give any information that would really make a bit of a narrative, to be honest. I think in terms of the clinics, I mean, we're really pleased with the partnerships we've got there. They are local, which is important to the health systems. We are providing different services depending on what we want to do and what the local needs are, and it fit really well into Walgreens' brand.\nAnd of course, as we said, when we did these partnerships, we have the opportunity of providing more pharmacy services to the health care systems alongside that, which is the bit that you don't always see.\nSo again, these are more mature. We are performing exactly as we wanted to. They are different from location to location, bringing added value to customers and driving - [Technical Difficulty] of a relationship in our pharmacy business with important health care partners."]], ["Just curious how we should be thinking about this shift and the impact to the business as we look out into 2018 on the gross profit dollar growth expectations within the U.S. ", ["Hi, Robert. Again, it's going to be a similar answer, I'm sorry, but it's really a similar answer. As Stefano said in his prepared remarks, we will look carefully at what we are achieving and we'll look carefully to what we can achieve and we use all the levers available to us, as you'd expect.\nSo we are confident that we can grow our share, as George said in prepared remarks, in Med D and in the other books of business. So volume will continue to grow. We continue to work hard with partners to gain access in the networks that are available to us, both commercial and government. And again, the announcement last night was another example of that. And of course, we continue to really work hard to make sure that we give real incentives, effectively, to our peers, as they want to be paid not just in the cost to fill the products, but to develop services with them that will change the model over time.\nSo we are in the market, we work with the market, we adapt to the market. And I think our evidence is very good. So we remain really positive that the 120 basis points growth that we have achieved in the dispensing market will continue to be held and we remain very positive that over time, particularly with the acquisition of the assets of Rite Aid, that we'll continue to grow market share in pharmacy volume and retain and grow gross profit dollars.\nStefano Pessina - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.\nAt the end of the day \u2013 Stefano here. At the end of the day, we give guidance, look at what we have done in the past, how we have given our guidance, the results that we have delivered at the end. Everything is in our guidance. And though you have to look at it \u2013 and our guidance, it's really the synthesis of all the elements of our businesses. We couldn't be clearer than that."]], ["And how are you thinking about it in terms of \u2013 you talked about before about the preferred networks and that Rite Aid would be a nice asset to add to your assets for those networks. ", ["Hi, Bryan. Thanks for the question. Yeah, it really was quite simple. Post the transaction, the team's really looked at it location by location. And really, the vast majority of these closures will be Rite Aid and the vast majority are actually \u2013 being closed are within one mile of another drugstore that we own going forward. So it really is a micro level and real detail and also we have a very strong record of file transfers.\nWe understand how to do it. We understand the economics of it very clearly. And I think as the numbers that George described in terms of the value of this $300 million by spending approximately $450 million, you can see this is economically a very good thing to do. But also because mainly within one mile of each other, it means that the network, the ones remaining, really, is buying on our strategy. It really is about improving access to Walgreens in the future and in Northeast and the South of the country."]], ["And then just a follow-up on \u2013 I guess, from our math, about half the stores that you're getting from Rite Aid have, I guess, already gone through a remodeling type of phase and what are your thoughts on \u2013 can you talk about the additional investment in some CapEx? ", ["Yes. Thanks, Bryan. Again, as you know, the sizable amount of these stores, not the majority in this occasion, have been remodeled. So therefore, they are in good shape. However, there are some which are very important just from a network point of view that would require some additional capital.\nAnd also as we develop the front-end proposition in Walgreens further, we'll have the opportunity to move some of that investment with a good return also into these stores. So again George has mentioned a figure for, not just for integration, but a figure also of $0.5 billion. I think it was more or less for capital improvement into the stores that we're buying and remaining open going forward."]], ["is in the mid-20s, you're 40%-plus ex-U.S.\nMy question is, when you look at the stores where you've done beauty, you've done mix enhancement, you've done simplification, could you give us some proxy for how much gross margin improvement you've actually seen in those stores? ", ["Eric, if you worked for Walgreens, you know that you'd know the answer, but unfortunately, we can't give you the answer. We don't give that level of details, and I'm really sorry we can't give that. But we keep on reassuring you that we understand the model really well. We are working diligently to apply that model appropriately in the U.S.A. and we believe we're making strong progress and you can see that coming through at an economic value that Stefano described.\nSo again, we're into almost 3,000, 2,900 stores with the differentiation. We have farther to go much more opportunity there. You can see that we have also materially improved the cost of goods, both in the retail side and also on the generic side, again, (55:45) that constant working with suppliers and long-term ways to make that happen.\nAnd you can see how we are carefully investing our cash as well as our operating costs to drive improvements in volume and also improvements in customer experience. Our internal Net Promoter Score's and many of our brand measures are improving going forward towards more of a pharmacy-led health, wellness and beauty retailer.\nSo we continue to work diligently on this model. We continue to believe strongly that we absolutely know more about the American market has achieved it. We understand the customer is changing, we understand the market is changing and we will adapt appropriately. So again, I don't know what more we can say. We can't give you any more detail. But I promise you that we are satisfied with the progress we are making.\nStefano Pessina - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.\nAnd you see you said that coming from UK, we are used to better margin and higher margins. But if you look at the pharmacy, the pharmacy in UK is quite under pressure and it has been under pressure for decades, I would say. And the way that we have \u2013 the reason why we have developed both with this increasing margin on the front of the stores \u2013 the shop or creating a completely new model is just because over time, we had to cope with a margin in the pharmacy, which initially being very, very good, as it shrunk over time and we have to compensate.\nSo we go out to adapt. In the U.S., the margin of the pharmacy is still decent. It's under pressure, yes, but we have so many levers to compensate for it that we are not particularly worried. But in the meantime, we are trying to create a new model that will help us to keep overall the profit of the company at the level which we believe satisfactory.\nAlexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.\nAnd also, Eric, I mean, I would encourage you to take a trip to the UK, see how we continue to improve the model in the UK. For example, our holiday season started really strong in the UK because the gifting in that marketplace is really strong this year. So again, I think we often have a conversation in this call about the U.S.A. only. We have a model in Europe which we continue to improve and continue to drive, and I think it's worth sometimes understanding that model even more in terms of looking at the whole group and what we can bring to the knowhow to the American market."]], ["I know you mentioned that Rite Aid shouldn't be materially accretive in 2018, but I'm wondering if you could talk about accretion level in the first full year, I guess, the run rate for fiscal 2019. ", ["We've not given the specific guidance beyond what we've said in numerical terms, but to help you with your thinking, in terms of the Rite Aid stores, we'll be acquiring them on a phased basis.\nAnd as we've said, we've just acquired the first few in the last week or so to start testing the IT systems. So we'll be acquiring those on a phased basis over the next six, seven months until the spring of next year.\nWe then have the store optimization program which I talked about, which Alex has elaborated on a little more detail, which is when we acquire the stores over time, we then have to really treat them like internal file buys and do the conversion. And that is going to take roughly \u2013 we've got an 18-month program from the spring of 2018 through to the end of 2019.\nAnd then we have got to convert \u2013 as we convert the existing stores, we've got to do the remerchandising, the rebranding, putting in our IT systems, getting everyone trained up, particularly the pharmacists on our pharmacy management program, which is very important part and obviously moved the logistics over.\nSo really, as we've said originally, it will take a number of years to complete that till we absolutely see the full benefit from the Rite Aid transaction, which we're very confident about.\nAlexander W. Gourlay - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.\nHi, Alvin, it's Alex here. Again, from an operational point of view, we feel really good about this execution. The team have been working really closely, this has actually gone on (01:09:21) for almost two years, and we got going really quickly and the first stores that was mentioned in the prepared remarks by George have transferred really well. So I think we're feeling good. We're well prepared and we'll get this job done and execute it really well and get this network inside of Walgreens network."]], ["Alex, when you talk about the evolving business model and trying to meet all the kind of competitive threats out there, can you kind of talk about other things that you're doing? ", ["Sure. Sure, Charles. As Stefano said, we have a lot of pilots and tests in the marketplace. Again, we are very pleased with the progress on all of them. They're really testing, at this stage, consumer behavior. We'll currently (01:16:17) get consumers and patients to see us differently and use these services that we are now providing.\nSo just some examples, LabCorp, as you said, that's a recent one. That's early, but the early indications are positive. And of course, we learned something from the previous experience we had in terms of customer experience with the team we had before. Secondly, we are moving to an increased number of pilots in optical. We have a big business in the UK, a very successful business in the UK and global partnerships with the most important partners in this industry in the UK and are bringing all of that knowhow to the American market. And again, we're pleased with the progress so far.\nHearingcare. Hearingcare, again, we have a successful business in the UK. We understand the model very well and again, we're bringing that here to the U.S. in a test and trial here in the U.S. as well. And again, that's happening just after Christmas.\nAnd last but not least, we talked about urgent care where, again, with MedExpress, we're in the ground (01:17:25) in urgent care. And again, that is going well so far.\nSo again, using our physical convenient locations, using our healthcare brand, working in partnerships to give them access to our Walgreens customers and of course, working together to make sure that we target people through data in the most appropriate ways are all part of what we're doing right now in terms of developing new business models in that healthcare space. All work in progress, all being properly managed, all with the best partners in the U.S.A. market and so far, so good.\nStefano Pessina - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.\nAnd I want to stress the idea of partnership because to have a partner in areas which are close to what we do as a basic business but not exactly the same is important because of course, these partners will continue to evolve and adapt their technology, so we are sure that we will be always at the forefront of what is required of the needs of the customers. And having also a strong partner will help us \u2013 once we will have really tested carefully the formats of our offer to the customers, a strong partner will help us to develop the business very rapidly, to roll over the business very rapidly. And this partnership are, for sure, an important element for us and we have had very, very good experience in the past in UK and in other countries when we have been able to select the right partner."]], ["Can you just give us some thoughts on how you're looking at that in the sense that \u2013 does it make sense at some point to really have those as your own, maybe through acquisition or growing \u2013 building it out organically? ", ["It's really early. I mean, at the moment, we're really I go back to \u2013 we're looking at customer behavior and how that's changing inside of the Walgreens brand and inside the Walgreens box, the properties. And it's very encouraging. So, of course, we'll analyze what we bring. We bring great locations, we bring a great brand to which customers associate healthcare. But we also, as Stefano said, believe in partnerships. We believe in not having to build things that already successfully built. So we will assess all of that in urgent care. But you're right, more and more healthcare is going to be delivered in communities and many people see the drugstores today as an ideal place to deliver these healthcare services. And of course, we are doing lots of work to understand what that could look like in the future, as I said, with the very best partners and urgent care, for sure, is a good example of that."]], ["Can you give us some \u2013 your comments on what you're doing in terms of trying to prevent over-prescriptions and divergence and maybe a sense of how long you've had these measures in place? ", ["Sure, yeah. We rolled something called take back out, I believe it was about 18 months ago was our first take back. And now, we've now got that in 800 pharmacies evenly spread across the U.S.A. And we're now expanding that by another I, think, it's 800 in partnership with our key partners to provide that service even closer to communities in America.\nSo people can bring back their unwanted drugs out of their bathroom cabinets to make sure they're not available for misuse. That program is going very well, I think and the ones we have at the moment, we've got about, I think, it's 80 million tons of drugs back, so that program is going very well and we're delighted that others are also doing that now as well.\nSecondly, pharmacist education, really important and we're making sure that pharmacists really understand how to deal with this issue in a positive way through Good Faith Dispensing as a program has been in place for many years and we continue to drive that and improve that.\nAnd thirdly, we're working with the industry to make sure that any other opportunities there are to play an active part in preventing this situation, we play a role in as well."]], ["Are you considering getting into the mail business, where Walgreens members could go on online and order a script through the Walgreens website and then you would ship it to them through your own mail facility? ", ["No. I think we've always had a mail business. We combined it with Prime's mail business as part of the AllianceRx deal that we announced last summer. So we're always looking for ways to reduce cost to fill. We believe that the position of our network, which is closer to customers than any other network in the U.S.A. allows us to have a lower cost last mail and give customers the flexibility of being able to receive the prescriptions in their pharmacy and potentially at home. So, of course, we're looking at that option. But really I think that's not a response to Amazon, it's a response to the customer opportunity we have."]], ["But do you ultimately think that all the things that you're doing and beauty can overwhelm, kind of from a positive standpoint some of the drag from these other categories and actually get the front-end comp back to positive?\nAnd then much longer term over the next couple of years, how do you see customers shopping Walgreens from a front-end perspective? ", ["Yeah. Hi, Mike, it's Alex here. Yeah, Walgreens' strategy is always to be the \u2013 very convenient, it's a convenient-driven strategy and that does not change. So the model we are developing really is to really understand more and more how customers will shop today and in the future from a convenient location.\nSo job number one is to simplify the offer so they can find a product really quickly they want at good value, a combination of convenience, quality of products, uniqueness of products and also price. We believe we can do that really well in healthcare and do well in healthcare OTC and also going forward, we're doing it better and better and better in beauty. We think that's one that we can accomplish.\nIn terms of other categories, they're very important to that offer. So we are working hard. For example, we just re-launched the Nice! product, that own brand product. The packaging is fantastic. It is doing really well early on, and that's a roll-in, roll-out. So again, we will continue to improve the quality of our products and the quality of our value and improve the convenience as part of that model.\nI think that the second thing I would say is that what's really important to the customer in the future, particularly the evolving customer is the app and how we can join both the convenience store with our mega (01:30:05) app under Walgreens. And we've got a really good platform, a mature platform there and more and more, we're connecting it into a store and allowing other people also to connect into store in the same way.\nSo again, since we combined all of our assets and ecommerce under Walgreens.com, we have seen good positive growth in Walgreens.com, in particularly health and beauty again. And again, we continue to invest in that particular capability and will do going forward. So again, nothing changes. We just got to adapt to the evolving customer.\nOf course, we want to see improvements in front-end sales, but more importantly of all, we want to see a value proposition, a customer proposition, which really makes us more unique and more focused on the emerging customer than the all-drugstore model. And that just takes time, as we said before."]], ["And then secondly, if you look at the underperformance, right, of those stores versus you or versus the core Rite Aid base, so how much of that is real estate versus operational issues? ", ["Oh, well, again, we believe that over time, by transforming everything into the Walgreens brand and improving by learning lessons from Rite Aid and also applying what we are doing from the knowhow we have in our group, WBA, to the Walgreens model, that we will be able to generate similar returns today from Rite Aid as we get from Walgreens.\nSo for sure, there are some location \u2013 some profit disadvantages in the Rite Aid portfolio. We understand that. But having said all of that, so we think we can improve Walgreens further and we can improve Rite Aid further and put them both together. So I know it's a clear answer to the question, but we are confident in the synergies of being $300 million plus over the full-year period. And of course, we're looking to improve that further. And as Stefano said in his prepared remarks, we're always looking to improve our core business anyway and will put both of these together going forward.\nStefano Pessina - Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.\nAnd also, remember that we are closing certain stores, transferring the files to other Walgreens stores. This will have a double effect. To eliminate the store, which generally is not particularly profitable and to increase the efficiency of the stores where we transfer the file, this, of course, it's in the synergies that we are expecting, but at the end, the stores that we will keep will not be bad stores, so will already be good stores. And improving the offer, improving the service, integrating them into the Walgreens organization, these stores will, for sure, be absolutely comparable to the rest of the stores that we have."]], ["And I was just wondering if you could talk about one the \u2013 sort of the profit profile of some of the stores that you are looking to acquire and the attraction of that subcategory of stores. ", ["Hi, Elizabeth. Good morning, it\u2019s Alex here. Yes, the profit profile first of all of the stores we\u2019re acquiring is more or less the average profile of Rite Aid, maybe slightly less, but more or less the same, and also the same investment profile you know that\u2019s already have been investing well in their wellness format and again these stores have got the same profile as the stores that we\u2019re retaining. So we feel pretty good about that.\nAnd they\u2019re mainly doing [filling][ph] in the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic and the Southern, Eastern regions to give us more presence in these regions and pretty obviously, as the service of Walgreens over time can get to customers and patients in these areas. So we feel good about that core of stores we\u2019re acquiring. We think they are good value for us and it will really, really improve our network particularly in the regions that I mentioned.\nIn terms of partnerships, I think we \u2013 you also yesterday saw we announced our partnership with LabCorp which we\u2019re really pleased with, seven store trials called LabCorp at Walgreens and adds on to the partnerships that we've announced in the past particularly with clinics across the many healthcare systems in the U.S.\nAnd how we see this working both from a space usage point of view, a convenience [Indiscernible] through our pharmacy and then linking into the various IT systems and technologies that we have. We really see this will drive not just cost reduction for us, but real convenience and access for customers and ultimately of course more volume descriptions for us over time in more healthcare and pharmacy services.\nWe\u2019ve made good progress in the last couple of years with the strategy. There's more to come and as long as it fits from a customer point of view next to our pharmacy and as long as it makes sense to reduce the costs in the healthcare system, we will continue to test and trial and roll out these services."]], ["And then, two, more generally speaking, could you talk a little bit more about some of the additional partnerships you guys have been considering and sort of the assets that you guys bring to the table and what sort of things you think might be particularly helpful? ", ["Hi, Elizabeth. Good morning, it\u2019s Alex here. Yes, the profit profile first of all of the stores we\u2019re acquiring is more or less the average profile of Rite Aid, maybe slightly less, but more or less the same, and also the same investment profile you know that\u2019s already have been investing well in their wellness format and again these stores have got the same profile as the stores that we\u2019re retaining.

", ["Well, I have spoken of a second phase of development in our company. We see when we merged, of course our focus was on synergies, and our focus was on cutting cost. And as you have seen, we have been consistent with what we were saying and we have really achieved the level of synergies and the level of cost reductions substantially earlier than promised. And at the end of this year we will have for sure better numbers then even we were expecting.\nSo now as I said many times, the integration of the Company and the improvement of a new Company go through different phases. Now, we have done the first phase and we have other phases and in each phase that we will be able to reduce cost and probably to find additional synergies.\nFor the time being we have rationalized the Company. We have gone through the most evident cost reduction that we could see. We have improved our procurement and we have tried to buy better or to exploit the possibilities that we had due to our scale and our geographic expansion.\nAnd now we have to go back and refine the work that we have done and of course now our focus will be mainly on Walgreens and mainly on the stores. Of course, we have done important things in the stores, we have improved the supply chains, we have changed or started to change the mindset of people focusing more on the customers we have started to collect information and data on our customers in order to understand better what they wanted and what we could do for them.\nAnd now it's time to put all these things together and to reorganize our stores in that direction. We have to understand exactly which kind of categories are really of interest for our customers because it's not particularly useful to us a bit of everything if people are not really appreciating it.\nAnd so we said that we are really focusing more on beauty, on health and beauty particularly and so we have started as you have seen, now we have started to rollout more products, we have started to test many models, but now it\u2019s time to really go back and really put in act - put in the stores, so, all the experience that we have done in these two years and these will be the focus of the second phase of the development.\nPart of this, for sure, is the logic of having other players with us in our stores, because we have space, we will get more space with the rationalization of the stores and we have to use this space for trying to give a better experience to our customers. And so that we have trialing many different partnerships and most of those trials have been successful and we have to hold them out over time.\nThe combination of these two things will give a new look to our stores, which is what we need and what we had really what was really in our strategy from the very first moment, but we had to create the platform, the basis in order to build these transformation of the stores. And after we will have another phase, a third phase, which will be based on technology. We are making big investments, big efforts in updating \u2013 upgrading our technology.\nWe will have a completely new system in a few years, maybe few years in the next I would say, many months. And at that point, we would be able to make another jump in the organization of our stores and this will be the third phase. This is exactly what we told you, I would say from the very beginning or at least in the last two years and this is the program that we are following. Alex, do you want to add something?\nAlexander Gourlay\nNo, I think I\u2019m really pleased \u2013 just one that\u2019s \u2013 I think it was mentioned in the prepared remarks. We're really moving into phase beyond the beauty differentiation phase of simplifying the core offer and we\u2019re just trying to roll out up to 1,000 stores by the end of this year.\nSo it\u2019s another important step in the Phase II as Stefano described. So this is very active. It's very real in the business, and we continue to drive that model forward. And the idea of this one really is to simplify these stores and specially extend that customers can find products more easily and we can edit the products on their behalf using the data that we have been collecting in the last three or four years. So we're not slowing down here. We're actually speeding up is the main point I want to add to Stefano\u2019s description of the activity."]], ["One is for the guide for the rest of the year and the other one within the context of this comments, how should we think about the growth algorithm going forward? ", ["Okay, I\u2019ll try and take some of those in the right order. If I start, perhaps, with just the tax, as I said in the prepared comments, the core tax rate was 25.3% and then this quarter if you look back historically, we had a relatively high number of discrete positives clearly very significantly quarter-by-quarter as you can see going back historically.\nAnd as I say you can see this was a relatively high number, but I think in terms of the core tax rate and helping you with the model, the 25.3% that you see it today is clearly under U.S. GAAP or the rate that we would anticipate at this point for the core tax element for the full-year. Just in terms of buyback program, clearly, we've announced the program just today.\nAnd I think \u2013 and just in thinking about modeling, clearly, we\u2019re pretty well the end of June now, so we\u2019ve really only got a couple of months to go to the year-end. So there's not really long for any impact where we to choose to commence that program, any impact will be relatively modest. Obviously, our guidance as ever is all in, but again as I said in the prepared comments it is of course assuming currency exchange rates for the balance of the fiscal year.\nAlexander Gourlay\nThis is Alex here. We are confident from an operational point of view that we can get to that number at the end of the year and continue to drive the strategy that Stefano described so clearly. So you\u2019ll see through our numbers, the volume in pharmacy continues to be as we expect it, strong as the partnerships and we made a slight improvement, but an important improvement in the underlying sales growth in the front end and the margin in the front end continues to be accretive year-on-year and cost control is good. So we remain confident that we can get that done.\nGerald Gradwell\nIf I could just, again, ask people to speak up and speak clearly when they're asking the questions, we can\u2019t answer questions, we can\u2019t here properly. Thank you, next question.\nStefano Pessina\nI would add something. What we are trying to do at the end, we said from the very beginning, our aim is to keep the adjusted operating margin as healthy as possible. And you have seen that in spite of all the difficulties of the market. Over the last years, we have been successful in doing that and we hope that we will continue to be able to do this. There are many ways in which you can derive the numbers and the success of a company and we are really focused on these metric.\nWe know that there are always additional opportunities to buy better additional opportunities to be more efficient and not just to cut costs for the sake of cutting cost, but to be more efficient. And so we accept that the market is a very challenging market that we have worked in challenging market for decades. We know that this will be our environment in future and as we have done for the past, we will really try to compensate and to respond to the challenges of the market through other actions that we can implement and we have always implemented successfully."]], ["Stefano, you talked about challenges and opportunities and talked about different new partnerships that will come about, obviously there's been a lot of talk about Amazon and then potentially getting into the pharmacy market? ", ["Well, let's say that I see everything as an opportunity and not because I am an optimist, but just because we have demonstrated in the past that we can survive in an environment. Having side so, honestly I don't believer that Amazon will \u2013 the interest in the near future in the next few years in these market, because they have so many opportunities around world and in many other categories, which are much, much simpler than healthcare which is very regulated business and also it's a business which in industry where the consolidation has been really quite significant.\nSo there is not a lot of new things that they could do, of course they could. But not so many as they could do in other markets, so as they are a very good team and very rational team, I believe that at the end this will not be their priority. Having said so, if we were wrong and our belief was wrong, I believe that at the end of the day, we could find our goal in the new environment and we wouldn\u2019t exclude to partner with them, we wouldn\u2019t exclude to analyze the new situation of the market and to find our place adapting ourselves.\nSo honestly I have seen the emotional reaction about the move that Amazon has done with Whole Foods, but I have found these reaction as I said emotional and with all due respect not rational, because if you analyze things accordingly, you will see that this is not the best opportunity for Amazon and you would see that the market has changed so many times in the past and the big players in this market have survived. So better luck we will continue to survive in any case."]], ["And then my second follow-up and I agree with you and I think that a lot of prescriptions sell today are Medicare Part D, and I think that's where my follow-up question is for Alex. ", ["Obviously, yes. I think, clearly, having more pharmacies in certain markets will improve access for Medicare D for sure and that\u2019s something that we contemplated in terms of the partnerships we have. So this makes us slightly more attractive. I don't think it fundamentally changes the prices paid to be honest. It just makes us more attractive in certain markets, all will certainly help.\nIn terms of the market itself, we continue to have strong partnerships, which you see that much of our volume beyond the new partnerships with the Prime and Express Scripts have been driven by Med D this year and we continue to operate well in that market with a target from three or four years ago.\nThere has been some changes and that will continue to occur and we'll continue to govern these changes properly to make sure that we are paying within the prices that we think is right for the service that we provide. So we remain very confident about our position in the marketplace, very confident about the prices we have and continue to govern what we get paid as best we can under the reimbursement pressure that Stefano has described."]], ["As you think going forward, when you talked about the reimbursement pressures, can you maybe just qualitatively give some sense of what could be some positive contributors to gross profit dollar growth within the U.S. ", ["Hi, Michael. Yes, it\u2019s Alex here. So I think as George said in his prepared remarks, we are in the early stages of our new relationship with Rx Alliance Walgreens Prime and that will be accretive in terms of dollars over time. Although, as we all know, specialty is a high-sales and low-percent margin business, but that will be accretive and it's a very important market in the U.S., and we're pleased with the progress made, although it's very early days in this partnership, but you will have noted that we were able to win the FEP contract as one example of the attractiveness of this new model in the marketplace.\nIn terms of other gross dollar opportunities going forward, it is more difficult to see in the network side of the stage to be honest, there's more headwinds, as you can see in the Retail Pharmacy gross profit. As Stefano said quite clearly, we\u2019re used to living with these headwinds, and our strategy here has been very clearly to do three things.\nOne is to increase our volume to make better use of our network. Secondly is to improve our buying capability, which again you can see very clearly. And also thirdly is to really make sure that we work with other healthcare services to improve the overall gross profit dollars we\u2019ve got. And the major aim of all of these activities is to make sure that we focus on the bottom line. The operating profit at the end of the day is, I think is the most important to us.\nSo that\u2019s how see it and I think we see that continued pressure, more headwinds and tailwinds, and we continue to work all these levers to improve our operating profit and you\u2019ll see in this quarter, we improved our operating profit in the U.S. by [6%] as, I think, as one example of it."]], ["A quick question really, just simply, is that just given the lengthy FTC review of the original proposed Rite Aid merger; it\u2019s safe to say that you're now obviously pretty familiar with these specific hot-button topics at the FTC.

But I can tell you that we have designed it in a way, which has been very carefully thought through with Rite Aid with our consul to take a kind of all the feedback that we received during the last 22 months of a very detailed review process.\nStefano Pessina\nAlex, do you want to comment on the question of the overlap and whatever else?\nAlexander Gourlay\nYes, as I said before, operationally we really like the spread of these stores. They really give \u2013 we get in some new markets locally, we are able to really intensify our presence for patients and customers in these markets.

We decided that the best outcome for both company was to go to a merger. And we were thinking at the time of course and following the advice of the specialists that the merger could go through without major issues.

Of course in doing that we had \u2013 and we have to take into account and then needs of both companies. So because if the Rite Aid sell \u2013 decide to sell certain stores. They have to do eat in a way that the remaining company can be efficient and can overall take into account the money that they will receive overall can be better than before.\nAnd from our side we have to buy those stores, which are feeling certain gap that we have in our network. And in other cases are strengthen our position in other states. So this has been a thoughtful let's say deal as Marco said taking to account all the objections that we could imagine from the FTC. This is just an asset deal, but also taking that into account that our needs and the needs of Rite Aid because they have to come out from this deal as a stronger company.\nAnd we have selected a cluster of stores in certain states where we needed them. But we could not really cover all of our gap because these would have left Rite Aid in a situation which operationally would not be particularly efficient. So this is really the best possible deal between our two companies and I strongly believe, strongly believe that this is a deal, which is a very good for us because we get probably 70% \u2013 80% of what we wanted as national coverage and is very good for Rite Aid because they come out from this deal as a stronger company and with a company which can be very efficient operationally."]], ["But when you do look at the store maps in the Rite Aid slides, it does look like the stores you're trying to buy do still seem to have a decent amount of overlap with existing Walgreens stores at least on a state-by-state basis.\nSo I guess I'm just trying to think here should we assume that the new plan takes into account feedback from the FTC such that you're highly confident in a shorter FTC review for the new asset purchase or could this still be a battle with the FTC even for the new plan?

", ["Marco?\nMarco Pagni\nYes, Charles, this is Marco Pagni here again. We\u2019re not able to comment on how the FTC may or may not see any particular facet of this transaction. But I would say is that it - it's important that the Rite Aid going forward be competitive in the market and clearly it's an option to join our procurements vehicle, WBAD will help it, but that\u2019s cost of goods going forward, which we believe is important for its competitive position in the market, and I express the view as to how the FTC will see that, but one could imagine that might be important for them.\nStefano Pessina\nAnd in any cases, it's an option, so they can exercise it or not. So it is not a mandatory part of the deal."]], ["Stefano, I want to return to your comment on this transaction being more attractive than the original deal, if we look at the cost per store, it's much lower that would seem to be a clear benefit. ", ["Well, on the deal, yes I said that this is a more attractive deal not because the other deals were bad, the other deals were good and we believe the other deal. But of course, after we have to make a lot of compromises and at the end of the day the deal were different from the deals that we had in mind.\nSo this deal, it\u2019s much simpler. It's an asset deal, so it\u2019s less controversial \u2013 much less controversial. We don't take practically any liability. You can imagine that as part of the deal we have just talked and we have the tax savings that we will find amortizing the goodwill at least cash wise.\nIf you think that the amortization of the goodwill is on 2,000 pharmacies practically and the inventory is on 2,000 pharmacies plus, three quite big warehouses you will see that we have a strong cash element in this deal already there. So it\u2019s clear that economically and thinking of the IR, this deal is very good.\nOn the other side, this is not a bad deal. I believe not at all, it's a good deal also for Rite Aid because at the end we don't have to give any part of the value to third parties. So in reality, the two parties are better off. And about our coverage, well, it's very important that we have a complete coverage. We were relatively weak on the East Coast. So this was our main objective particularly in the Northeast because it's a very rich region and it\u2019s a region where it's relatively easy to work. So this was our main thoughts. We would like to have a few 100 stores more on the West Coast.\nYes, of course, we would like it even though we are present there, but there are certain spots of Southern California and maybe the State of Washington where we would like to have a more stores. But at the end of the day, our presence there is already better than the present that we had in the Northeast.\nSo if we had to choose by far we prefer to be stronger now and very present in the Northeast, even because as you know California is not an easy state for us and for everybody to work in the healthcare. So I believe that we are very happy what we have achieved and it's important that we have this coverage because it's important to be able to offer a wide coverage to our customers. And it's also important for us because we have a better basis to amortize our cost and we have a better basis to sell our products. Alex?\nAlexander Gourlay\nHi, Eric. At this point of coverage being the operating efficiencies, there\u2019s both, but I would say there is probably more in the operating efficiencies side. Again, if you think of all we\u2019ve achieved with Walgreens and also think of the ambition as Stefano described very well in an earlier question to simplify and make the front end more efficient and more differentiated. Once we have done that in the first phase of IT simplicity, we'll be able to plug-in all these stores into that platform. So I think there\u2019s a lot to go at in the operating efficiencies probably more than the coverage site in reality."]], ["business, and I know this is the same case last quarter, but can you just help us understand a little bit better how despite the really strong script growth you've seen in the last two quarters that gross profit dollars were actually down again in the U.S. ", ["Hi, Robert, it\u2019s Alex here. Yes, I think all the drop year-on-year, as George said in his prepared remarks about 100 basis points was due to specialty. So, there for the trend on the two quarters as you pointed, it\u2019s about the same that you ask a little bit worsening, but not significantly worse.\nAnd as I said already in another remark, we are really focused on operating margin. So therefore we drive \u2013 operating margin by driving volume through the fixed \u2013 primarily fixed cost base. And again I wanted a big call, it\u2019s a teams who have handled that volume and the cost base, as you see has been almost flat in reality, giving a 6% more growth in the USA in this quarter.\nSo I think that's the model that we spoke about it before that\u2019s the model that we've been executing, recognizing, as I\u2019ve said consistently the reimbursement pressure is really \u2013 and what's driving really is market condition the consolidation really of the PBMs in particular. The downward pressure on pricing and that's a real effects that we're seeing with less inflation on branded drugs and that\u2019s clearly featured the marketplace this year in particular and we continue to see that going forward.\nNow we were used to this as Stefano said and we used to managing in a certain way and we're pleased with the progress of our cost of goods. The WBAB organization continues to perform well for us and we set a new partnership there with Express we announced in May.\nWe continue to work on the cost base and the structure of the company and where Stefano said already we're moving into Phase II there and we have more opportunities there and we continue to work in partnership to make sure that we get the volume into that fixed cost base in the future. So that's our focus. It would be wrong we tell you that I see a time in the future, when I see that the reimbursement pressure going away from its current levels as the market and we are operating an effective to be within our marketplace."]], ["And then I guess George, if you look at where the company will be post this transaction, I think it looks like maybe somewhere in the 3.5 times, leverage ratio on a rent adjusted basis is factoring the buyback as well? ", ["We've not published our long-term leverage target. We've chosen as you know Robert to talk about our commitment to solid investment grade and that\u2019s very much what our policy as we've obviously because of the time is taken since the original announcement of the original Rite Aid transaction we've obviously been building up a lot of cash, which is not something that we like doing we're very committed to having an efficient balance sheet. We have to do and that\u2019s why today when we've announced the new transaction, we've been probably announced the $5 billion share buyback program.\nSo we're very committed to being financially disciplined to when we're looking at M&A we\u2019re always very focused on the numbers. If the numbers don't add up, don't give meet our investment hurdles then we're very disciplined, we don't do transactions and so we're very happy to grow organically and invest with to do M&A when we get the right returns, but equally a very clear policy of returning any surplus funds to shareholders within those parameters that I've explained, having an efficient balance sheet very important to us."]], ["My question is more when you're looking at these Retail Pharmacy contracts and networks as they come up and keeping in mind your goal to continue boosting volume through the stores? ", ["Hi, Bryan it\u2019s Alex. I would say it's mixed. I mean I think so first of all nothing is fundamentally changed year-on-year in the marketplace from what we're seeing. Some peers prefer preferred networks and some preferred to have open access across the networks. So I don't think there's anything fundamentally changing. There's certainly a trend towards more preferred networks over time, but that\u2019s more accelerated or decelerated and we are in the marketplace.\nWe look at every partnership to understand what the payer requires of us and what we can bring to them and then we work through the government processes, which are very tight in the business, what is that we expect to be paid in the current marketplace for the services that we provide.\nSo we \u2013 that\u2019s how we see it on the \u2013 it\u2019s very active for us, a very important part of our business and we try very deeply to understand what the marketplace and what the payers want from us and we're not trying to drive in any direction. We try and drive customer care and access and as such really our strategy."]], ["Then my final question just has to do with something that came up earlier in the call just in transitioning from kind of streamlining the operation to kind of transforming it and then looking at the pressure on gross profit dollars. ", ["Well, as we have said many, many times, we are not living in an environment where we will see a lot of goals and particularly where we will see margin going \u2013 gross margin going up. We accept these and we work on other part of the business, on other elements of the profit or loss in order to compensate for it. This is what we are trying to do what we have down and what we will continue to do.\nSo if you want to say that there are in these markets \u2013 certain headwinds, of course there are. But this is the nature of the business and we have to cope with it and we have to work on the elements that are available to half and believe us that are available to us to compensate for it, which we have done until now and we continue to do."]], ["Given the really strong same-store script comp this quarter, that's 7.9% you guys highlighted, can you share any thoughts on maybe why you didn\u2019t see a stronger corresponding increase in the front end? ", ["Hi Bob, it's Alex here. Yes, I think in the prepared remarks George and both Stefano said, it was a tough market first of all. So we saw good growth in a tough market, particularly in healthcare which you expect to see the link to the pharmacy business and also through investment in beauty care we saw again some solid growth.\nWhere we didn\u2019t see growth in the front end was really in the seasonal businesses. It was a tough Valentine's Day for the whole market. And also in food where there's quite a lot of deflation driven by competition and some commodity pricing that sort of affect us last summer is still running.\nWe do track as best as we can link sales and we are confident that we are seeing the link we expected. I'm also very confident as the market moves on this new volume and the new food will improve the front end performance against the strategy that we have clearly laid out."]], ["Just given your comments around the challenging front-end environment and the comments of not seeing as much pull through on uncertain whether you talk about seasonal or more commodity or food, how do you think about the layout of your store going forward?\nAlex, I think I heard you say that you did peephole through on a little bit of beauty, as well as healthcare. ", ["I think you are absolutely right. We've clearly got great corners. We had a platform of course is a great digital platform. So we have definitely got the right presence in the market. We don't have the right products in this space so we have physically in our stores. And we are doing something about that. I mean, as George said in his prepared remarks, we are now going to accelerate the reduction of our unnecessary SKUs. We've already been working hard in areas like seasonal before this I\u2019m going to go further particularly as we look our lower volume stores are going forward.\nWe are very committed to finding the right products on the right healthcare solutions for this space that we free up and we've got good experience in Europe, for example, with our opticians business and with the health and care business. And of course, we've got good experience here in America with clinics.\nSo you\u2019re absolutely right. We are really thinking very hard in testing and trialing different ways by which we can offer customers more particularly as we move more health, wellness, beauty convince model. And that's very much part of our thinking.\nBut it will take some time. I think as we said before to get the right customer experience, the right partnerships, and particular under economics but we are comfortable to find that model in this marketplace."]], ["How do you guys think about the evolution of limited networks going forward, the composition of those, in a lot of cases, is the economics more likely to be around Walgreens versus CVS in some of those networks or can it be kind of be more of kind two of you and other retailers not participating? ", ["Hi, John, it's Alex here. I think we play in the marketplace and the marketplace is definitely evolving towards narrower networks. We really work hard to figure out what the payer or the marketplace wants, whether that be the commercial marketplace or Med D, and obviously Medicaid as well, and we work on economic model to see what the volume evolves look like.\nSo we don\u2019t try and drive the marketplace in that direction. We believe strongly in partnerships. We have no best interest apart from looking after our customers and giving good value, a combination of price and service. But there's no doubt the marketplace is evolving towards narrower networks and we have to operate and participate in that marketplace."]], ["Just following up on the specialty questions so how was your sort of view of that market and the right competitive landscape and the right level of profits sort of evolved as you thought about the launch of Alliance Rx because it\u2019s obviously been area there is a lot of scrutiny, there is a lot of questions on what the right dollar level per script or what services should be required or should not be required. ", ["Yes, it\u2019s Alex again, I think that - we bring is that forward that efficiency it\u2019s the marketplace but that went all over and they\u2019re not for sure you know there is others who are larger of being that efficiency as well.\nBut secondly we bring the opportunity of the network pharmacies as I said before we don\u2019t just a central fill we actually own independent of Alliance Rx you the special network that are those in the center of excellence primarily based during the HIV. And also we have now a couple of hundreds specialty pharmacies we\u2019ll show you a host of hospitals a host of specialist doctors.\nSo again we offer you know with different register market and we offer a different approach. And we also believe strongly in this area that we should be paid for the service and the care we provide these are expensive complicated medications. We have pharmacists who are playing to the top of the certificates when they\u2019re taking care of patients who are on these medications and we want to make sure that we are adequately remove to that part of the process and other remuneration belong to the other bits in the system.\nFor example the PBM for example the insurance company we want to be well rewarded for giving the care that are pharmacy gets in that way."]], ["And may be on the big picture side one of the managed care organization have talked about sort of more integrated model or have talked about running a presence closer to the individual obviously you have some of the best real estate and you have also been quite great at lowering cost and prices for individuals and varying that high level of service.\nHow of your conversations with managed care around sort of what else you can provide to them or how you were sort of dispensing organization and other services fits in with their goals. ", ["Yes I can talk again, so again you know we have that I just seen - are sourced effectively a couple hundred and over clinics in different ways. And in these conversations they focus on really our strategic ability to become a very efficient and very localized dispensing service for them not really resonates with them.\nAnd secondly, we have as you said the real estate whether they can actually come in and have the lower cost ways of delivering services in the community outside of their more expensive systems. So these really are the two areas that we talk about a lot and we have a lot of different ways of doing that, a lot of ways of working whether it be with advocate here in Chicago.\nSo again it's - and anyway for sure the conversation are good and we are learning together and again goes back to partnership we know what we\u2019re good at I mean all of the areas where we want support and for sure clinic started to integrate is example of that."]], ["Just wanted to follow-up on the question about operating margin in the back half of the year how should we think about it by segment international retail operating margins in the back half should that continue to be challenge at a similar level as you in the quarter or are there opportunities there and also the U.S. ", ["I mean obviously we haven\u2019t given specific guidance by segment we had first provide by reiterating our overall guidance figures I mean in terms of thinking about sort of the modeling. There is going to be a number of factors that you've got to think about and firstly we will we are consolidating the new Prime deal from Monday when we completed it. You need to think about that in factoring the U.S. model recognizing obviously that is a specialty on mail business with different dynamics.\nIn terms of the international businesses, I think as we've said in the prepared remarks there is still the challenge in the U.K. with the NHS having cut the reimbursement that will continue the basis has performed robustly as we said over key customer period. But retailing is still itself quite challenging particularly in the U.K. which is our largest market. And then on wholesale sales, wholesale always a its kind of business or division that operates in a number of markets you can always get certain mix affect quarter-by-quarter.\nSo it's tough to model I know quarter-by-quarter but I did point out in the prepared remarks that in certain of the emerging markets we had some growth really in the period when you get price changes in the market where people tend to buy ahead of customers buy ahead of the price change and that was the notable impact in the second quarter.\nAlex Gourlay\nAnd it\u2019s Alex again. Just really quickly on the U.K. as George has said the reimbursement pressure was the main reason for the decline, really there was two things government did one they normally do which is they buy margin which is normal in the U.K. contract. But secondly this year on December they actually remove some of the service payments, practice payments. And again if you look on new deals, you\u2019ll see that\u2019s a big issue in the U.K.\nSo that really is the reason why we\u2019ve had our increases and operating profit. These two business had a good December and that we\u2019re focusing and controlling our costs it\u2019s really driving as we always do, you need a bit of products particularly in beauty and some marketplace and developing new pharmacy services. So we\u2019re looking to stabilize our business, but the impacts or the government action has been strongly share our main U.K. business."]], ["Like how much of that is going to flow through your P&L like when we think about central fill for specialty I guess what portion of specialty would that be any kind color there would be great? ", ["Well just on the accounting side I mean we will account for it on a fully consolidated basis. So when you're looking at our of sales, our adjusted operating income then you will obviously see a 100% of the entities results coming through, but then when you're actually looking at an earnings attributable to our shareholders to the WBA shareholders, we strip out and align the proportion that is attributable to Prime itself and I think as we said we own just over 50% of the business.

We have established the trust.\nThe trust between us and a certain number of companies, not all of them, not everybody has been able to create these elements of trust, but for certain companies, the trust is there and on the trust we can build a lot of additional opportunities in future. And so, our relationship with Prime, our relationship with Express Scripts, our relationship even with Optum, even though there have been many discussions about Optum, but are creating a new basis of discussion and new basis of collaboration, which of course can go beyond a simple contract and can probably - at the end also take in consideration a wider scenario."]], ["business and the price versus volume trends you are seeing there a little bit, where you guys continuing to see volume up pretty comfortably on the Scripts side with dollar sales coming in below that?

And we see really a couple of main factors George mentioned on the script. The first one is less inflation in branded drugs, that\u2019s pretty clear and that\u2019s our major chunk of it. The second one is volume. Volume in the market is down. So as you see we are doing pretty well in the market, 40 basis points open market share from what we measure, but overall the volume in the market is down in this quarter relative to the last quarter, and I think that's on top of that. And as you said, we have been pricing model competitively in some of our networks in preparation to drive volume as Stefano and George said in the second half of this year. And again that is the third element for us.

So, these are two vision and hearing care, which clearly we could transport from our experience in Europe.\nI think also we've been very successful in the last 12 months been able to outsource our retail clinics and again as a partnership model that we will speak about a lot and we have continued to sign deals and outsource these successfully with many partners across the Medicare, and again that\u2019s another way that we bring wraparound services and more patients into all regions by walking closely with local service providers, providing the services they want inside of a pharmacy across USA, that\u2019s an example of how we're thinking, how we're walking."]], ["Can you please talk a bit about the billion dollars in synergies that you expect to capture from the Rite Aid transaction by year three or four, like \u2013 I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s $1 billion a year and then what makes up those synergies?

As you know, we did announced today that would deal with Amazon and they are added to a long list of other distributors including Apple and Samsung and Google and Microsoft and LG, and others."]], ["And then on the parks, you called out in your press release lower attendance at Disneyland, which seems a little surprising our consumers waiting for the second attraction the second Star Wars attraction and your price increases in the past year have been on the high end of historic range. ", ["I'll take the second part of your question first. Price increases at the parks, it really, we don't look at it just as increases. We look at it as an overall strategy that as Christine said in our comments is designed to basically grow yields or yield management. We're trying to basically increase the Park experienced by spreading demand out. And by making the products more affordable during periods of time that basically lower peak periods and obviously more expensive during peak periods to limit the number of people that go in. There was, we believe that there were some delayed visited there was some visitation to Galaxy's Edge both the Disney Land and it Disney World people waiting for the second, you take it attraction to open it opens in less than a month in Disney World and will open in January at Disneyland. So, we sense that there are people that are just waiting for the whole thing to be open, which is fine. The meantime those two lands have been far more successful than been reported they've had a significant lift on per caps and merchandise and food and beverage as a for instance, just to give you one crazy stat but Millennium Falcon attractions carried over 1.7 million people already since they've opened across both places. So -- and the guest experience guest satisfaction, very, very high and right availability retraction availability in the high 90s that basically means that it's very, very complex technological attraction is running really well.\nThe first part of your question regarding Disney+, we're certainly absolutely will be made available in most traditional app selling locate stores or platforms. I don't have comment on access to consumer data if the MVPDs are distributing it or selling it.

By number -- on the number of people or the carriers -- who have been carried on the Millennium Falcon attraction was way low usually I pride myself on being right with statistics; it's 5 million not 1.7 million. And secondly, we will have access to significant amount of user data when people use our apps that have been purchased through MVPD. To your question about MVPD renewals, I can say that we have reached a deal in principle with AT&T and we're in the process of papering that which is significant in terms of our progress.\nWe've been candid and transparent about sub trends, as Christine mentioned updating that today. There has been sort of continued erosion in abated somewhat last year it's gone a bit now. We can't predict where that goes, we just feel that as a company, the MVPD platform is still very important to us and very valuable to us and I think quite viable as well I happen to believe long term that people will be interested in lesser channel -- less channels.\nIt doesn't mean that they don't subscribe at all to multi-channel services. But I think the trend will be in the direction of fewer channels rather than as many or certainly more and that's where the app business could benefit because I think people will buy into the app side of it and maintain some channel relationship, but I don't know what the floor is and nor do I think, the floor is anything close to being side . But we're looking at again holistically across all of our businesses in the platforms with an eye toward the broadest monetization and consumption.\nChristine McCarthy\nSo, Dan, on the rating agencies, we do have an active dialog with the agencies, it's the combination of me, the IR team and our treasury team and we keep them very up to date on our plans as well as our performance. We have a schedule. We're going to see them a couple of times a year. We're planning on that shortly. We'll go back and see them but we -- I think people saw that we had a significant a bond offering in August, a $7 billion bond offering. So the ratings were affirmed at that time. Across all three agencies as mid-single A and if you look at our leverage at the end of this quarter, you can calculate it, it comes in around 2.7 on a gross and about a 0.3 turn less on a net basis. And although the agencies make some adjustments to those calculations, suffice it to say that even when they calculate, using their adjustments, the agencies are still well below 3 times.\nLowell Singer\nOkay.

Have a good evening, everyone.\nEnd of Q&A"]], ["I know it's really early days, and you highlighted some areas of weakness 21CF had in the quarter but you also spoke about the opportunity of Fox and its IP presents longer term. ", ["Sure, Alexia. Thank you. First of all, regarding Fox and the integration, I think what -- in terms of these results, aside from a lot of the ins and outs that Christine described like the cost of Cricket in India, et cetera, and so on and the impact of the Hulu deal, I think one of the biggest issues that we faced in this quarter in terms of the result -- of the earnings was the Fox Studio performance, which was well below where it had been and well below where we hoped it would be when we made the acquisition. Now understand, I've been through a number of these. First of all, I was bought twice. First at Capital Cities/ABC and then Disney bought ABC. And I know what happens when companies are purchased. Often, decision-making can grind to a halt or certainly slow down. We've managed to avoid that in the purchases of Pixar and Marvel and even Lucasfilm in part because between when we made the deal and when the deal closed was relatively short periods of time.\nIn this case, we announced the deal first in December of '17, and we didn't close the deal until spring of 2019. And that's a long period of time for a business that relies on constant decision-making and constant attention to detail. And while I don't in any way mean to cast aspersions at any individuals at all, it was a very difficult transition for that business. And what we've done is we've put it under our studio, and you know the results there. They've been hard at work working primarily with Emma Watts on the live action side to redirect the efforts of the live action part of that business. First of all, to consolidate the cutback in the number of releases and then to focus on the kind of release that we would hope to come out of that studio. We like some of the movies that are coming up, notably there's one called Ford v Ferrari which we've all seen, which is great, but it will probably take a good solid year, maybe 2 years before we can have an impact, obviously takes longer on the development side but an impact on the films that are actually in production. But we're all confident that we're going to be able to turn around the fortunes of Fox live action, and you'll see those results in a couple of years.\nOn Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge front, to give you some color, I think a number of things happened. First of all, helped in part by some of our efforts, there was tremendous concern in the marketplace that there was going to be huge crowding when we open Galaxy\u2019s Edge. And so some people stayed away just because they expected that it would not be a great guest experience. The same time that was going on, all the local hotels in the region expecting a huge influx of visitation raised their prices. So it simply got more expensive to come stay in Anaheim. In addition to that, we raised our prices. We brought our daily price up, so if you think about local visitation, we brought the price of a one day ticket up substantially from a year ago. And then we opened up Galaxy\u2019s Edge with one attraction instead of two, the second attraction is going to open in January. And so all of those factors contributed to attendance that was below what we would have hoped it would be. That said, guest satisfaction, interest in the attractions, in the land is extremely high. They're among the most popular thing at the Park. And so long term, look, we build these things for the long term, we have no concerns whatsoever about them. We're opening Galaxy\u2019s Edge in August in Orlando. The second attraction there will open in December. And as I said, the second attraction in Anaheim will open in January. So we feel great about the product that we've created. It's just going to take some time for -- basically for things to work themselves out in terms of how the marketplace is reacting.\nChristine McCarthy\nAlexia, I just want to put a little more granularity on the Disneyland results for the quarter. As I said, the attendance was down 3%, but the paid attendance was up in the quarter, and that lower attendance was primarily driven by the annual passholder visitation. And when we look at the per cap spend across Disneyland all categories, they were up significantly year-over-year."]], ["Different topic but on all of the stuff that's going on in China as well as in Hong Kong, can you talk a little bit about -- or give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of impact on -- towards some of the parks and how it might be affecting pricing and future investment? ", ["Disney+ marketing is going to start to hit in later this month, later in August. We're actually going to allow members of D23 to be the first to subscribe. I'm actually going through a comprehensive marketing plan with the team next week. Comprehensive probably is an understatement. It is going to be treated as the most important product that the company has launched in, I don't know, certainly during my tenure in the job, which is quite a long time. And you will see marketing both in traditional and nontraditional directions basically digital and analog also significant amount of support within the company on basically company platforms. And then of course all of the touch points that the company has, whether it's people staying in our hotels, people that have our co-branded credit card, people who are members of D23, annual passholders, I could go on and on. But the opportunities are tremendous to market this. And I feel good about some of the creative that I've already seen. But you won't start to see it until later this month.\nOn the China front, to date, we have not seen any impact at all in Shanghai about the unrest that's going on in Hong Kong or from the trade issues between our countries. In Hong Kong, we have seen an impact from the protests. Obviously, they are significant in nature. And while the impact is not reflected in the results that we just announced, you can expect that we will feel it in the quarter that we're currently in, and we'll see how long the protests go on. But there's definitely been disruption that has impacted our visitation there.\nOn the pricing side, as we've said a number of times, our pricing is designed to really accomplish a number of things. One is to reflect the value of the product that we have in the marketplace that includes the franchises and the popularity of them. And of course, the investments that we've made in these parks and resorts by continuing to build them out and continuing to create experiences that are better than many of those that we've had in the past. We also have tried very hard to protect guest experience, and so the pricing has been designed to make it more expensive in peak periods to manage that demand and less expensive or not as expensive in the nonpeak periods to make it more accessible. And for the most part, we've done a good job doing that. We know that demand on our product is so extraordinary in the peak periods that it just is in our better interest to manage crowding because it just affects guest satisfaction.\nAt the same time that we have taken our prices up, our competition has actually been in the market discounting a little bit more. We've certainly seen that with Universal in Florida. And so the gap between what we did and where they've been maybe just a little greater than it's been, and perhaps that's had an impact. We obviously monitor these things very carefully. I try to explain what some of the pricing impact on Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge was, but we do not feel that we have a pricing issue at our domestic parks. And that's reflected in basically not only current business but a fair amount of research that we've done."]], ["Bob, as you get ready to launch Disney+, I'm wondering if you could update us on sort of the technical platform behind the product and kind of where that stands versus where it needs to be, scale a big business globally.

And then on the studio front, Christine could take some of the particulars as it relates to the television side.\nChristine McCarthy\nOkay. So 21st Century TV was a contributor in the quarter on an operating income basis. It had a more significant contribution on the cable side than the broadcast side. Although we did mention that there would be some headwinds in the fourth quarter, it will still be a positive contributor. It'll just be lower than it was year-over-year."]], ["And question number two, not completely unrelated, I'm a little confused at how you're thinking about the live television brands like National Geographic and the Disney kids channels which will also exist on Disney+. ", ["Good question. No. We're negotiating with a number of MVPDs right now to extend our linear or live, as you called them, television channels. And these remain important deals to us and important businesses to us as well. And obviously, that includes ABC and Disney Channel, and you mentioned Nat Geo and Freeform and FX to name a few. So it is important for us to continue to fuel those channels with enough quality, enough original programming to support the business as they exist today. We also know that if you look at all the disruption in our business, the business that's probably being impacted the most is that live multichannel television product. And so the pivot to the direct-to-consumer business is designed to not only address the opportunity that exists in that space, but to address the challenge that exists on the traditional side of the business, which means that we have our own balancing act to do in terms of fueling both sides, the traditional side and the new side or the direct-to-consumer business with enough quality product to succeed in both places.\nObviously, what we also are doing is setting ourselves up in a way that we can be resilient, probably more resilient than any of our competitors should the traditional side erode so significantly that it's not as viable as it has been as a business. And that would enable us to pivot pretty quickly by moving even more product from the traditional channels over to the nontraditional channels. So it's -- as I said, it's a balancing act. We believe that we're making enough quality product for both sides right now to feel confident about both sides of the business. The windowing strategy essentially is that we are taking a lot of product that we're making for the traditional channels and ultimately moving it onto the nontraditional. But we're also making, as you know, original product for the new channel, the Disney+ and Hulu, that will not go back onto the other channels. But although in some cases, it might. Just to give you an idea, we'd be making FX shows for Hulu that might premiere on Hulu but ultimately end up on the linear channels is one example of that. So we're going to look at variety of different opportunities and just make sure that there's enough content flowing in both directions for the businesses to be successful.\nOn the Hulu Live front, we felt it was important to do what we can to grow digital MVPD businesses. We obviously know that there are others in the space that have been good partners to us. YouTube would be one to mention. We like the fact that Hulu is out there with a product that is very unique, in that it gives subscribers an opportunity to buy linear television, digital over-the-top linear television, to buy off network programming because we know the deals, the content licensing deals that they have with the networks, and to buy original programming. And that combination of all three puts Hulu in a very unique place, in that there's really no one out there that's offering the comprehensive television offering the way Hulu is. And we'll continue to stay at it.\nThe other thing to note by the way is Hulu has grown -- is it's also developed into a very, very important advertising business. And when you think about advertisers who are looking to reach clients on digital platforms, Hulu offers a great opportunity to do that. To what extent those live channels will enable the opportunity on -- to sell advertising along with the advertising that is sold and the programming that's made just for Hulu is another story. But it's a big part and a growing part of that business.\nChristine McCarthy\nAnd one more thing on Hulu Live, the digital platform grew the most of any DMVPD this quarter."]], ["So Bob, one question for you on the content front, which is when you think about the balance between quality and quantity, how much content from a volume perspective is enough? ", ["As we said, Kannan, on Investor Day and we said a few times, given the fact that the Disney+ product is Disney and Pixar and Marvel and Star Wars, Nat Geographic, I mentioned it 8,000 times, we feel that we can focus more on quality than on quantity. But we obviously know we need enough quantity under each brand umbrella to drive subscribers who are primarily interested in those brands. And so obviously if you compare us to Netflix, we're going to have far less products than they do, but we're lying on the strength of our brands and the fervor that fans of those brands have for the product that we make under those brand umbrellas.\nChristine McCarthy\nAnd on the marketing side, Kannan, in my comments, I mentioned marketing, but that was related to 21CF's film studio that they had some marketing in the third quarter for movies that would be released in fourth quarter. But I'm assuming your question really is related to marketing that would go along with the launch of Disney+. And as far as that's concerned, we will be expensing those marketing costs as we incur them."]], ["When you look at the deals you've done in the past, you've talked a lot about acquiring powerful brands like Pixar, Lucas and Marvel, and obviously, we've seen the success there. ", ["Thanks, Ben. To give you some perspective, in the summer of 2017, I think it was during our August earnings call, we announced our intention to purchase the controlling interest in BAMTech and to launch Disney and ESPN direct-to-consumer service. Soon after that, Rupert and I first started engaging in conversation about the possibility of buying 21st Century Fox assets, so that when we began analyzing their value, it was all through the lens of the launch of direct-to-consumer platforms. And we were able to, in analyzing value, really think hard about how we might use or leverage both the content we are buying -- I'm talking about library, the brands we are buying and the titles, but also the people at Fox, which is critical, to essentially enable us to fulfill our goals as it related to direct-to-consumer.\nAnd I think if you then sort of dissolve almost all the way forward to our Investor Day and think about the fact that Uday Shankar was on stage talking about direct-to-consumer business service in India, which is beyond what we're even imagining back in '17, but the fact that National Geographic was well-represented, the fact that we announced The Simpsons deal, just a few examples, you can -- I think immediately conclude that the vision that we had, which is to analyze value through that lens, was basically being implemented or showing potential right away. I can't emphasize enough the importance of people, too. Because as I think we all know, these are ambitious plans, both in terms of managing the technology side and the interface with consumers, but in particular, ambitious plans when it comes to the creation of original content. And whether you're looking at the movie side or in the TV side, although in the direct-to-consumer front, the television side probably takes the front seat, we need great people to create all the programming and to supervise all of the talent that will be needed to serve consumers well on these platforms. And what we got -- in my prepared remarks earlier, but what we got in this acquisition upfront is just amazing. And so I feel really confident in our plans -- in the plans that we've announced and our ability to execute because of what we bought. It's kind of that simple.\nI know as I compare these to the Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars acquisitions, there are great similarities and there's some dissimilarities. I'd say Pixar and Marvel and Star Wars were probably more brand-focused, although in Pixar's case, it came with a solution to basically addressing the problems we have been having at Disney Animation. Marvel and Star Wars were brands. They're both about people as well; franchises long-term value. Here, we get a little bit of everything. We get some really strong brands: Nat Geo, Simpsons, good example of that. But we also have brands that we feel we can even strengthen by fueling them with more resources to create more product using those brands and put them front and center of our new platforms. I've talked about a lot of them in the past. And in all cases, I'd say we got great people, and that's very, very evident to us today. And also the other thing that's happening is how quickly we've been able to integrate not only the assets, but the people into our plans. I'd say if I'm pleasantly surprised -- one thing I'm most surprised about in a positive sense is how quickly we put people in significant positions of leadership in the company that can not only help manage our businesses today, but manage our businesses into the future.\nChristine McCarthy\nSo Ben, let me address your questions on synergy and the balance sheet. First of all, in synergy, we're still on track to deliver the 2 -- at least $2 billion in cost synergies related to the acquisition. We told you initially that you should expect us to realize about half of those benefits by the first full year and the remainder in the second full year. And once again, the $2 billion in cost synergies never included anything from the RSN, so that's immaterial to us achieving this $2 billion going forward. The other thing I've mentioned, and you'll see it in the press release and more disclosure in the Q, you saw some charges taken for restructuring. That number was 6 62.\nWe'll continue to take those charges as we continue to achieve those synergies, and you'll be able to follow it quarter-by-quarter. On the balance sheet side, we did significantly increase our debt portfolio. At the close, we had about $18 billion of long-term debt. And with the increment of debt and related positions coming from other entities, the balance -- the debt portfolio went up to about $52 billion. That's a number that our treasury group has been managing, too. We did some bond exchanges leading up to the close of the acquisition. So we're aggressively managing that portfolio in the same manner in which we have always managed the balance of short-term and long-term liquidity management and the way we positioned that balance sheet. On the -- you're probably also curious about leverage, and we have not recommenced any share buyback because we said we would not be doing that until our leverage ratios came back in line with that of the single A company. So for the time being, you can assume that our share repurchases will be suspended."]], ["This feels like a little bit of a different transaction, but I'd love to hear it from you now that you own the business, what you think the biggest opportunity is running this company and integrating it into Disney or opportunities as you look forward, so we can think about where opportunities and upside might exist.

", ["Okay. Multifaceted question. On the first question, the parks, I'll start with pricing. We have been very strategic at our approach to pricing over the last number of years, and it's really paying off. The results this quarter certainly are evidence of that. And what we're trying to the basically is 2 things, is to price according to demand, and in managing demand, try to basically spread out attendance so that we can preserve or improve the guest experience; it's that simple. The popularity of what we've been building, which I think is tied to both the quality and the scale of what we've been building, but also the fact that we've been building attractions in lands and shows, et cetera that are tied to some of our best stories and our franchises, I think has created an even greater demand and more popularity, which gives us more flexibility on the pricing side. But it's not just about raising prices, it's about being really smart about it, and it's showing.\nWe have, as you know, Jessica, a tremendous amount of expansion going on. Star Wars Land is only one of them, and there are two of them, I should say. We're breaking ground on a big project in Tokyo just in 1.5 weeks, for instance, so we're building cruise ships, and we've got expansion just about every place that we operate. Specifically in China, where business actually has been quite good lately, we have announced that we're expanding with the Zootopia Land. I don't believe we've announced the date for that yet, but we're continuing to look at expansion. And right now, our plans for expansion there are solely focused on Shanghai. We've now talked about building at another location at this point. By the way, going back to Galaxy's Edge and Star Wars, the lands which are attractions themselves, have two e-ticket attractions. One is the Millennium Falcon experience or ride that I've tried a number of times, and it's fantastic. We're opening with that. The second attraction will open later in the year, but we've not said when. And as I've mentioned on my call, the Star Wars Land or Galaxy's Edge will open in Orlando at the end of August. Did I cover all the aspects of that question?\nChristine McCarthy\nJessica, I would just add one thing on margins. Since I have been in this role, I think any time a question came up about the growth in the parks' margins, it was usually asked in the vein of, can this margin improvement continue. And I just want to say that while we don't give any guidance on margins, there's nothing structural that would prevent our margins growing from here. And as Bob articulated, the growth -- the yield strategy is something that benefits the parks on multiple levels, spreading the demand, improving the guest experience, and also driving to the bottom line. We also see further potential for improvement in our international parks businesses and also managing our cost base effectively by deploying capital and labor efficiently. So I don't think there's any -- there's no constraint right now that we believe on our parks margins."]], ["And then if I could ask just one follow-up, Fox just announced an equity stake in Stars Group to pursue sports gambling and sort of leverage their existing set of sports rights. ", ["Well, on the gambling front, we've said, and actually we've already done some things that we would integrate it into our programming, but not to the extent that we would be facilitating gambling as an entity. In other words, we'll provide programming that will, I guess, be designed to enlighten people who are betting on sports. But that's as far as we would go. And I think you'll see more of it integrated in the programming, but we just don't intend to go into the gambling business. On Sunday ticket, I think I'd rather -- I'm not going to elaborate much except that there have been some exploration as to whether there was an opportunity there, but I'm going to leave it at that. And we're very bullish on the NFL. By the way, we got a great schedule this coming year. But we're bullish on the relationship ESPN has with the NFL. And I think we all believe that there are opportunities to strengthen our relationship with them."]], ["And what can you take in terms of lessons learned that could apply to Disney+?\nAnd then the second question is, there seems to be a lot of controversy on The Street about the size of the revenue displacement from basically foregoing license revenue at Disney as you move to Disney+. ", ["So the first part of your question, Michael, I'd say that what we've learned, which is extremely valuable as it relates to future launches, particularly at Disney+, is that the BAMTech platform that we invested in when we bought BAM is an extremely robust platform, capable of handling not only scale in terms of live streaming simultaneously but a substantial number of transactions in a very short period of time. I mean, there were times before the UFC fight that BAMTech was taking in or making just under 15,000 transactions a minute, and the stability of the platform is critical in times like that.\nWe also learned, which is not really unexpected but we saw it in real time, that ESPN's primary platforms are fantastic marketing tools for the direct-to-consumer service, and you can obviously expect that we will use Disney's strong marketing platforms for the Disney+ service.\nWe also feel that the consumers had a good experience not just in terms of the ability to watch live events under high quality circumstances on mobile devices but, in general, the price-to-value relationship seems very strong. And I'd say lastly, the brand is very strong as well.\nSo if you consider all of that, the fact that we have a technology platform that's working, a user interface that's working, the ability to sign consumers up en masse, the use of the primary platforms to promote the new platform in what we believe will be a strong price to value relationship with Disney and then the strength of all the brands, I think it all adds up to a very, very positive picture ahead of the launch of the Disney service, which is going to come toward the end of this calendar year.\nChristine McCarthy\nMichael, I'll take the question on foregone licensing. When you look at the foregone licensing, it's going to cross over two segments, our Media Networks and the studio. When you look at fiscal '19, that licensing revenue in combination net of APR, we estimate would be a decrease of about $150 million to OI year-over-year. That will be more heavily weighted to the second half.\nRobert Iger\nAbsolutely. $150 million.\nChristine McCarthy\n$150 million. That will be weighted to the second half. And to put some context on that, Captain Marvel, which is coming out in this second quarter, is the first film that we will withhold from our output deals. So that's where you can see the foregone licensing revenue begin."]], ["How you - Bob, I guess, how you balance your existing business and the direct to consumer initiatives?\nI guess, in many facets, how you balance potentially more aggressive investment spending versus maybe providing the shareholders earnings growth that some of your shareholders will be looking for. ", ["Thanks, Alexia. As I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, we have an event on April 11 when we're not only going to demonstrate the app, but we're going to talk in great detail about our strategy, the impact of our current businesses and the impact on our bottom line. And so I think we'll answer a lot of the questions then.\nBut what we're basically trying to do here is invest in our future. And the investments that we're making in both the technology side and in creating incremental content are all designed so that long-term this business will become an important part of Disney's bottom line and long-term strategy So I think you have to look at this.\nIt's almost the equivalent of deploying capital to build out our theme parks when we could have deployed the capital in a variety of other directions. This is a bet on the future of this business. And we are deploying our capital basically so that long term, the growth of this company is stronger than it would have been without these investments.\nIn terms of making the decisions about where content goes near term or today versus traditional platforms, first of all, since we are betting on this direct to consumer business long term, we obviously have to fuel it with intellectual property. And so we're creating intellectual property incremental to the properties or the product that we're making for our traditional platforms just so that we can launch this product.\nAnd then in some cases, we're moving product over that perhaps could have been on traditional platforms. And again, we're doing that because it's a capital allocation in the direction of long-term growth for the company.\nI won't get into the issues as it relates to the windows, but we're not looking to compress the theatrical window here. There might be an opportunity down the road to adjust the windowing in terms of when we bring product from [Technical Difficulty] maybe the home video window into the so-called pay window. But initially, we're approaching this under relatively traditional lines from a calendar perspective.\nAnd then I think the last thing that I should add, and I think this includes the assets that we're buying from 21st Century Fox, is we had in The Walt Disney Company not only a collection of brands and we're adding to them with National Geographic and FX and Searchlight, et cetera and so on but we have talent, both executive talent - talent relationships and production capabilities that give us the ability to scale up nicely in terms of our output and not invest that much in overhead or infrastructure to do that.\nAnd so we're going to leverage the people and the capabilities of all of our traditional media businesses we're doing today to grow the product with some incremental expense obviously to produce the product, but very efficiently but to grow product for the new platforms."]], ["And can you give us any sense for sort of the opportunity to turn this business profitable, because, while it's got real scale in subs and revenue, we all know it's generating losses today?\nAnd maybe you could tie Hulu into the broader go to market with Disney+. ", ["The goal obviously is to operate Hulu profitably and we're not going to say how long that might take. That could shift a bit because, at some point, we'll look more aggressively at some international rollouts of Hulu as well. And I think it's also premature to discuss much about Hulu because, until the Fox deal closes, we only own 30% of it. We'll own 60% when the deal closes, and we'll be prepared to talk more, perhaps, about Hulu's strategy at that point.\nBut what we said when we decided to launch ESPN+ and Disney+ is that rather than creating one gigantic fat bundle of sports, general entertainment programming and family programming, we thought we'd serve the consumer better by segregating all three.\nUltimately, our goal would be to use the same tech platform to make it easier for people to sign up for all three should they want to, same credit card, same username, same password, et cetera, but give the consumer the kind of choice that we think consumers are going to demand more and more in today's world.\nIf they wanted to buy all three, we'd give them that opportunity, potentially at a discount, or two for that matter. But if they wanted to buy one of them, we believe they should be able to. So someone who wants sports should be able to buy just sports and so on.\nIn terms of going back to the first part of the question in terms of profitability - well, actually in terms of our belief in the platform, there's enough out there in your sector and ours, meaning in media and in the businesses that follow media that have been talking about direct to consumer growth. And we see that obviously with some of the big players in the space, notably Netflix.\nWe think there's huge potential for Hulu to grow as well as for the other services to grow and plenty of room for other entrants in the marketplace. But we aim to take advantage of, on the Disney and the ESPN side, our brands and that expertise.\nAnd on the Hulu side, we hope to take advantage of the fact that they've already launched successfully and their brand is starting to build some equity, but also in the production capabilities of the businesses that we have, including the businesses that we're buying."]], ["I'm asking in part because of the addition of the UFC and some of the Fox content like shows at FX and Deadpool are already pushing the envelope a bit, perhaps.

", ["Steve, on the first part, we've been witnessing, over the last few years, a substantial increase in the popularity of our parks.

The addressable advertising is recorded in - reported in our direct to consumer segment. The increase that we saw this quarter was because there were more ESPN impressions that they were able to monetize based on a higher level of user engagement.\nSo they saw a nice uptick. So when you incorporated that - and this is just domestic. It doesn't include international, and I can comment on that in a minute. But the domestic, when you include that, equates to a 5% increase.\nThe categories that were most frequent in the addressable advertising were from studios, video games and telecom. And that's pretty much what you would expect, given that it's addressable or digital.\nOn the international side, there was a slight downtick, but that had everything to do with foreign exchange. ESPN's international business is very much based in Latin and South America. And the foreign exchange, the currency fluctuations there are what impacted that.\nRobert Iger\nOn the Shanghai side, we've seen some attendance softness this year. We're still running a profitable business, and we're still investing to grow it. But some of the issues that China has been facing, a slowdown in - or a decrease in consumer confidence, which has resulted in fewer Chinese people traveling within China, has had an impact on our business. That has made it less profitable than we hoped it would be at this point.

", ["Well, on the Star Wars Lands, these are the biggest lands that we've ever built and in both cases not only are they big in size and scale, they're huge in ambition in terms of both the experience that we aim to create, meaning the immersive experience as well as the specific experiences people have in the attractions, namely in both cases, two very, very innovative and we believe compelling and exciting e-ticket attractions.\nAnd so we think that they're going to have a major impact and Disneyland clearly is the biggest thing that we've ever done at Disneyland since it opened in 1955. And we think it's going to drive huge increase in demand and we think we're going to have some interesting challenges on our hands to manage that demand, but that's a good problem to have.\nAnd then in Florida, we have four parks. Star Wars Land there is going into the Studios Park, Hollywood Studios Park where we opened Toy Story Land not that long ago and we've aimed to actually grow the attendance to that park, which has lagged a bit over the last number of years because we haven't invested anything that is this close to size or scale or compelling nature of it. So we think in both cases that it will have a dramatic impact positively on both businesses.\nOn the first question about ESPN+, I think there are a few things you have to consider. First of all we've learned positive things. It clearly is working in terms of interest from users and subscriptions which continue to grow. From what we gather from the research we've seen and just generally anecdotal information, it's a product that is considered a good consumer experience, easy to navigate, easy to use and very high quality in terms of the quality of the live streaming.\nAnd we've put onto that product a fairly strong inventory of all kinds of different sporting events. And we've seen consumption that's actually quite interesting for things like MLS during the regular season, which is soccer. We've seen some nice uptake in some of the college football numbers. And we are putting on, by the way, just under 3,000 college basketball games in the next few months, 550 of them alone in the month of November.\nAnd then we put the UFC on, where the big UFC fight, biggest, first big one after the first of the year will be exclusive to the platform. And for the 30-some-odd UFC fight nights thereafter, 20 will be on and exclusive to this product.\nSo I would say we're kind of just in the early innings, to use a sports analogy, of where we're going to be product-wise. And then we're also in the early innings in terms of where we're going to be from a feature set perspective.\nAnd last week I was in New York at BAMTech. And they gave me a great presentation on personalization and customization and the technology that they've \u2013 engine that they're creating to better serve the consumer in that regard. Because we know there's a huge opportunity there, given people's interests in very specific teams or specific sports or specific leagues or specific geographic territories.\nSo I'd say what we've learned is quite positive, a product that is working. And it gives us reason to have great optimism as we add more content. And we will add more technology features.\nAnd then we haven't really even begun marketing it. Someone pointed out earlier, we talked about \u2013 actually it was Christine McCarthy. As we talk about putting more college sports on, the affinity that people have to the colleges that they've gone to is extraordinary. And we're just beginning a process to start marketing very specifically to alumni from different colleges, who may not be able to find sports from their college on what I'll call the national sports networks.

", ["Thanks, Michael. I'll answer the second question first. We have no updates regarding the regulatory filings. In June, our S-4 stated that we anticipated getting the necessary regulatory filings in the various markets around the world between 6 and 12 months from then, and we don't intend to update that at all.\nRegarding Netflix and our strategy regarding the apps, first of all, because we will be launching the Disney app into the market probably in about, well, a year, sometime the end of calendar 2019, we're going to walk before we run as it relates to volume of content because it takes time to build the kind of content library that ultimately we intend to build.\nThat said, because the Disney app will feature Pixar, Marvel, Disney, ultimately National Geographic will be a contributor, Lucasfilm, Star Wars, we feel that it does not have to have anything close to the volume of what Netflix has because of the value of the brands and the specific value of the programs that will be included on it. And the price, by the way, will also reflect a lower volume of product as will, by the way, the cost of producing and owning all that content.\nObviously, after the deal closes for 21st Century Fox, we'll own 60% of Hulu. So that will fit in very significantly to our app strategy. And then I talked about in my earlier comments and we've spoken a fair amount about this in the past, we have the ESPN app.\nAs we look at all three, it is our feeling \u2013 and as we look at the environment today, I guess one thing you could even point to would be the great growth in the new digital OTT offerings where you're looking at essentially fewer channels, slightly less choice for less cost. We don't really want to go to market with an aggregation play that replicates the multi-channel environment that exists today because we feel consumers are more interested in essentially making decisions on their own in terms of what kind of packages that they want.\nSo rather than one, let's call it, gigantic aggregated play, we're going to bring to the market what we've already brought to market, sports play. I'll call it Disney Play, which is more family-oriented. And then, of course, there's Hulu. And they will basically be designed to attract different tastes and different segment or audience demographics.\nIf a consumer wants all three, ultimately, we see an opportunity to package them from a pricing perspective. But it could be that a consumer just wants sports or just wants family or just wants the Hulu offering, and we want to be able to offer that kind of flexibility to consumers because that's how we feel the consumer behavior, what consumer behavior demands in today's environment."]], ["Bob, a couple of years ago when you guys had the first Star Wars film come out, you talked about sort of leveraging the entire company's assets to really make that movie successful or as successful as it could be, made it a priority for the company.

", ["Well, I'll answer the second question. We'll be going to market with some very attractive product. Obviously, I don't know if we could cover all of what they are because you certainly know what they are, Alexia. And we also know that the traditional distributors are very, very interested in distributing our DTC products as they do right now, by the way, for Netflix.\nAnd so, we actually believe that they can in a sense live side-by-side as part of the negotiation and not necessarily create issues. I think there is a reality that is set-in in the distribution side of the business that the business is changing, that consumer habits have changed, and that the over-the-top SVOD product is here to stay and is real, and is probably going to continue to either compete with the more traditional platforms or complement the more traditional platforms. So we don't really see it complicating our negotiations with the primary distributors.\nThe first on, ESPN+, I realized when I said that the subscriber numbers were exceeding our expectations, it was probably going to beg the question, well, then what are they and we haven't been specific. They don't tell you if (33:19) we're telling the truth, so that doesn't do much good.\nWe had relatively modest expectations. I'm not going to be specific on numbers. We're just not ready to get into that. But as it related to what kind of subscribers we would ultimately achieve from the beginning in part because of the nature of the product offering, but actually we've added nicely to that product offering.\nBoxing is the probably the primary example, but there has been some other good programming as well. And we've been heartened by the fact that the conversion rates from free to pay have been quite strong and the trends that we're seeing in terms of churn are modest in nature in the sense that they're manageable. As we add more product, I mentioned in my comments, we've got a huge lineup of college football, 200 games coming up this coming season, 70 in the first three weeks. UFC kicks in.\nToday, we announced the inclusion of the very attraction Italian soccer league Serie A. So Cristiano Ronaldo's first match with his new team will be on ESPN+, which is exciting. And then, of course, as the season unfolds the next baseball season and the NHL season, MLS, there'll be regular games from all three of those leagues and more and more programming.\nSo we feel really good about how we are positioned and we'll continue to look opportunistically in terms of what rights will be available. A lot of the rights in sports are already spoken for, but we still have some opportunities including some opportunities to take some of the rights that we already own for the ESPN primary channels and move them along.\nGive you an example is, we have a lot of inventory for Little League World Series. And we've noted that as we've gotten more specific with consumers about what Little League games will be available, our subscription sign-ups have ballooned in the last few days as a for instance we believe as a result of interest in just that. So we actually feel good about it. It's a marathon; it's not a sprint. The product seems to be working well technologically. It's quite stable from a streaming perspective, and we feel great about it."]], ["So you've listed now a couple times all of these great brands that will exist and live on the Disney direct-to-consumer entertainment service.\nI guess my question is pretty much every brand you listed, I believe, has historical content obligations to other licensing partners.

And as rights become available or as we're able to negotiate for rights to bring back, you'll see them on the service and so on and so on.\nBut if you look at the 2019 Studio slate, I saw something recently posted just about the Studio slate. So in calendar 2019, the Studio slate is about as strong as it gets. And to give you some ideas, it's got Captain Marvel, Dumbo, Avengers, Aladdin, Toy Story 4, The Lion King, Artemis Fowl, Jungle Cruise, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX, all in calendar 2019. None of those films are encumbered by existing distribution deals.\nSo when we launch at the end of 2019, now they still have to be windowed in based on how we bring product to market, but the windowing will not be affected by existing licensing deals.

There's nothing more really to add on that.\nOn Sky, there's really nothing further to add. I think just to clarify because there were some erroneous reports about this. But there was a filing in the UK today. It was a formal filing as per UK Law, and that's what Fox had to do to basically formalize its \u00a314 offer for the remaining 61%. But as per our July 8-K filing, our consent is required for an increase in that bid. And since this is a fluid situation, an open matter, we really are not going to comment any further about it.

So that's one.\nTwo, we believe that the use of our IP, which is part of a lot of this expansion, creates growth. And, of course, the more popular our IP is, the more in demand is at our parks. Another opportunity is in pricing. As we build out these experiences in terms of scope and scale, but also as we make them better experiences using technology to do things like book attractions in advance, et cetera, we believe that gives us pricing leverage that comes from simply delivering a better experience.\nAnd the last is that business has been great at running under very, very efficient circumstances. And while we're not going to promise continued margin expansion, we certainly believe that that opportunity exists. So we feel, overall, great about the future of this business, particularly by the way as we get to build out some of the newer parks, Shanghai being probably the best example of that.\nOn the second question, we announced, as you suggested, the two new digital products \u2013 the ESPN+ product and the Disney product \u2013 well in advance of the Fox acquisition. So neither one is dependent upon that acquisition. Both are capable of taking advantage of some of the assets we'll be buying as part of that acquisition.

", ["I'll answer the second part first. We think that there's opportunity to expand in China, and there may also be opportunities in other parts of the world. We are constantly engaging in conversations with people from different markets who would love us to put Disneyland in their market. We're going to take a look at some of them because of the population base that lives in those markets, and consider all the factors that we typically have consider which are things like economic and political stability, spendable income, other infrastructure issues, you name it. But I'd say that there's an inevitability to us of building parks in other countries, but it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to build something anytime very soon. But we're going to look.\nOn the first question, when we were considering the best way to integrate the Fox assets, we asked ourselves how best to organize the company. And one of the things that we looked at was how some of the new entrants in the marketplace are organized. And you typically find \u2013 Netflix is a good example. They have global platforms that their content is basically distributed on. And that includes global means of managing customers, data management billing, customer acquisition, customer retention, you name it. It's essentially one technology.\nAnd I then thought, if all of these assets were to come together today from day one and in fact on day one without any of the legacy organizational issues, how would you best organize them? And it became clear that we could be organized, not only in a more efficient way, but in a more modern way to take into account how our businesses have been transformed by technology. And that led to a decision to reorganize now well ahead of the Fox acquisition, because if it made sense once we buy Fox, it seemed to make sense even before that.\nSo what we basically did is we have three primary content divisions: one I'll call Media Networks or television; another one would be sports, ESPN; and the third is the Studio. The Fox assets would plug into all three of those. Then there was a division that was mostly focused on physical goods and experiences, where there were some obvious synergies and overlap in efficiencies really between Consumer Products and Parks and Resorts.\nAnd then we looked at creating essentially a global platform of distribution business that would include technology and would ultimately leverage the technologies that exist across the globe and across our current businesses, but then factor in the technologies that exist in the assets that we are acquiring.\nAnd it seemed to make sense that international become part of that part because as part of the acquisition there are two big platforms, Sky and Star, that are part of that. And so, if this acquisition happens, it seemed to make sense that the international assets and I'll call the platform assets are in one business.\nSo there's just a lot of efficiencies in managing the way we take all this IP to customers around the world. It's our intention to create great user experience and in an efficient way, not only with our moving the content to people, but an effective way of monetizing it. And it really dovetails with exactly why we're interested in these assets, which is to continue as a company to invest and then to create great products and experiences around the world, to invest in great technology, to make it more modern and more innovative in terms of how customers interface with it, and diversify the company internationally."]], ["So anything we can glean on at least marketing around that?\nAnd then, secondly, can you remind us how big Toy Story Land Shanghai is relative to the Shanghai Park and maybe your expectations for what this can do, either drive attendance or have people stay longer? ", ["The marketing strategy for ESPN+ is relatively modest in nature. We have primarily resorted to using time and the marketing opportunity on the ESPN platforms, including the channels, the magazine, the websites, and the existing app. ESPN Digital is the most popular sports digital product out there. It dwarfs some of the competition, and that gave us ample opportunity to promote basically what is a new app experience.\nSo the marketing costs are modest. There is some investment in additional programming prior to launch, but we made more investment with the announcement of UFC. That doesn't come until 2019, and we're going to continue to invest in product to make ESPN+ a real digital sports marketplace.\nWe're not going to give you specifics about the size of the Toy Story Land, but it marked a substantial increase or expansion of that park, building a new land. It's not as large, by the way, as the Toy Story Land that we're opening this summer in Orlando. But having been there last week, it's sizable in nature. It's got some great attractions, retail and dining experiences. And, I'll call it, it makes a dent in terms of scale of the park.

Actually, we're particularly impressed with the quality of their customer experience, the user experience and the customer service they provide. And that's certainly something that Disney can appreciate, given our record of providing high-quality customer service.\nI'm not going to anyway quantify what the strategic fit is except to say that in today's world a platform that can bring product to consumers in very, very user-friendly and effective ways and then to monetize this in the process is something that we believe is attractive.

", ["So the technological guts behind the entire ESPN online or app experience is being completely redone. And so, the app that we are launching sometime this spring \u2013 we didn't give a specific date \u2013 will be a completely new app. The app itself will have three primary features, as I've been saying. But I'll go over them one more time because I want to drill down on a couple of them.\nThe first is the obvious; it'll have tons of scores and highlights and new stories about sports. And that will be highly personalized, both implicit and explicit. So it's going to use the BAMTech engine, data collection, data management and all of the bells and whistles from a personalization, customization perspective that that can provide.\nThat will, by the way, be evidenced in both video, as well as basically the written word that's presented, the stories that are presented, customizable obviously by teams, by locations, by general interest. But also basically machine learning elements of it will enable the app to determine what someone is interested in and feed them more of that as they use the app more.\nThe second feature is live streaming of the networks themselves. That's under authenticated circumstances. And so, if you are a subscriber to an existing service or if you want to subscribe in the future, you'll be able to use that to stream ESPN1, ESPN2, ESPNU, et cetera. There, if you want to watch it on a small screen, a mobile screen, obviously the app will provide that. The Watch app today does that. But you can also, as you know, use a variety of different devices. I happen to use Apple TV or I AirPlay. I use Apple TV to access the app, but you can also AirPlay it directly from your mobile device to a large television.\nAnd then, of course, the third feature is going to be this Plus feature, we're actually calling it ESPN Plus, because it's offering an incremental thousands of hours of live sports programming basically to the ESPN experience. And then, in addition to that, that would be the home of the 30 for 30 series; the entire library of 30 for 30 product will be on there. And we'll continue to invest in original and exclusive content just for the app.\nSo it's a three-in-one, completely new experience, new technology, and it will basically enable people to access ESPN just about any way imaginable. And we're not only excited about it, but, if anything, points to what the future of ESPN looks like, it'll be this app and the experience that it provides."]], ["And does that change when you acquire Fox?\nAnd, secondly, when you talk about Lucasfilm hiring Benioff and Weiss, who have an amazing track record, why not focus that energy on making a serialized drama that maybe works better for SVOD and builds value over time versus films. ", ["BAMTech is part of our Media Networks, because it's Media Networks that BAMTech is primarily providing services to. And so, it will power a number of different sort of go-to-consumer experiences. And I can't really say what we will do post regulatory approval on the Fox acquisition. We're looking at a number of different organizational opportunities in terms of how we structure. And, clearly, we're interested in some form of conformity when it comes to technology. When I mean conformity, I just mean basically being more efficient and being more consistent and using basically our best talent and the best technology that we have across as many businesses as possible.\nIn terms of how the product is actually created, BAMTech largely is responsible for the technological underpinning on audience management, to some extent some sales as well, because they have a lot of experience not just in how to create these experiences, it's also collecting user data, managing customer acquisition, customer retention, billing, and then all the necessary dynamics or technology needed for far more dynamic advertising opportunities and experiences. And so, the editorial side of ESPN will still flow through ESPN, work in conjunction with BAMTech. But the technology side is largely BAMTech's responsibility.\nOn Lucasfilm question you asked and Benioff and Weiss, their interest was in creating a series of films that are Star Wars based. And we've actually been talking to them for a long time. To my knowledge, they didn't express interest in creating a series. But they have an idea about a number of films at some later date, I'm sure we'll disclose to all of you just what those are. They're focused on a point in time in the Star Wars mythology and taking it from there.\nWe are developing not just one, but a few Star Wars series, specifically for the Disney direct-to-consumer app. We've mentioned that and we're close to being able to reveal at least one of the entities that's developing that for us. But because the deal isn't completely closed, we can't be specific about that. But we are pleased with the level of interest among the creative community in creating not just Star Wars, but other series for this Disney app. And I think you'll find that the level of talent that will be on, if you call it, the television front will be rather significant as well."]], ["Can you talk about how you're thinking about some of the revenue benefits from integrating Fox, particularly on the production side?\nAnd then on the theme parks side, can you give us any color on Toy Story Lands? ", ["I'll start with the second part. We're building two Toy Story Lands. One will open in late April in Shanghai. We broke ground on that, I think, actually before we actually opened Shanghai. And the other one is being built in Orlando. And that will be opened some point later this year, but we have not announced a date. And they're both large lands, they're not as large as the Star Wars Lands that we're building.\nI'm not 100% sure how they compare in size to Cars Land, but they all will have multiple attractions and other experiences. And given the fact that that franchise is still quite popular and we're making a fourth Toy Story film that comes out in 2019, we feel good about it. They're large in size, 10 acres I'm being told versus 13 acres for Cars Land. So they are not quite as large, but they're large enough. We feel good about that. And they'll have very, very distinct IP from Toy Story. So in other words, people will know exactly what the experience is going to be. We basically immerse you in a toy world.\nTo your first question, I think the way to look at the revenue opportunities, as particularly as it relates to production, is to consider the fact that what we're buying here is significant production capabilities and, with that, the talent to produce on our behalf. The production or the output that we're buying from those entities will flow through our studio in both the tent-pole movie direction, but also in, we'll call it, specialty movie direction, the Fox 2000 and the Fox Searchlight businesses, as a for instance. And there is also capability there to make films for direct-to-consumer experiences.\nIn addition to that, Fox has had significant success on the television studio front, Modern Family, This is Us, two very specific examples of that, as well as on the FX studio front, where they produce a number of the series that are on FX.\nAnd so, we will, as a company, when combined, have far more production and obviously production capability to flow into our traditional distribution businesses, that being TV channels and the motion picture exhibition business, as well as the capability to create product for our direct-to-consumer businesses. And we're really \u2013 and this is \u2013 I think needs to be considered on a global basis. So this, obviously, is application well beyond just domestic consumption or domestic distribution platforms."]], ["Bob, just on the Studio, you guys have been such a stand-out in the box office this past few years and the pipeline continues to look so strong given the tracking early reviews of Black Panther. ", ["So, Alexia, as you know, the Netflix output deal expires with the 2018 slate. They will have rights to the films that were made in 2016, 2017, 2018 for quite a long period of time thereafter with a window for us to use them ourselves that falls within the period of time or the tail that they'll have those rights. The films that our studio makes in 2019 and beyond will be sub-licensed or licensed to our own platform, and that will include the Marvel, Pixar, Disney and Lucasfilm films. And we'll talk at a later date about our intentions regarding the Fox studio output, but obviously Hulu is a possibility in that regard. But they have been existing output deal already with HBO that will last longer than by a few years the deal that we have with Netflix.\nBut it's ultimately our intention, and this acquisition clearly will enable this even more, to create and to ultimately grow a global direct-to-consumer business that will take advantage of the production output that the combined companies will have, whether it's on the television side or on the network side. And we fully hope to actually expand our production of intellectual property under those different umbrellas, Studio and Television, to feed multiple channels and in particular direct-to-consumer businesses that we own.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.\nAlexia, thanks for the question on Hulu. You're right that we said at our November year-end call that we expected Hulu to come up with about a $100 million greater loss year-over-year. And we now expect that equity loss for the year to be approximately $250 million higher than last year. And the best way to think about that, how it's going to fall, you can expect about a third of that to impact our Q2 results. So the increase is largely related to the content licensed from Hulu's equity owners. And as one of the equity owners, our portion of these incremental costs will largely be recouped by ABC's program sales, as well as affiliate revenues to some of our various networks."]], ["I don't want to put words into your mouth.\nBut then, Christine, when you sort of laid out the sub-loss, I think you said minus 3% effect on cable networks, which is the same as the minus 3% last quarter. ", ["Okay. First, I'd like to just touch on the subs comments. So as you noted, we did a growth of 7% from contractual rates and a decrease of 3% in our sub-count for the quarter. And the 3% versus 3% is due to rounding. But I would also say that we did see a modest sequential improvement in Q1, which is the second consecutive quarter that we've seen this trend. And the growth is being driven by adoption of the digital MVPD platforms.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.\nAnd just to add to that, Todd. What we're seeing is very encouraging in terms of the digital platforms. I mentioned on the CNBC interview that we're noticing that people are coming into the basically multi-channel world or subscribing that we've previously considered cord-nevers. Clearly there lower price, the fewer channels and the more sort of mobile-first and improved basically user experience, are all having an impact on attracting new consumers. And we believe the trends in terms of growth in the new over-the-top or digital platforms will continue. And, hopefully, they'll continue to offset because the growth is getting compelling. The loss is on the traditional side.\nOn the Shanghai front, I think there are a few things. We didn't note it because Shanghai has had just a great year, including some days where they just had unbelievable records, well over I think 65,000, 68,000 in attendance on one day in October. And the comparisons to a year ago are relatively similar, because we've had just a great year consistently.\nIt was announced in December that we're taking our prices up. We're actually going to a three-tier pricing strategy. And that will have some impact on the bottom line going forward, provided attendance continues to be strong, which we fully expect it will. And then, we opened Toy Story Land there in late April, April 26. And so, that will represent an opportunity in terms of more capacity. And we have on the drawing board a number of other potential expansions. We've got some discussions underway with our partners there to address some of that in the months and then, of course, the years ahead. But Shanghai is doing quite well.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.\nAnd, Todd, I'll just add a little bit more of year-over-year comparisons for Shanghai. And once again, the parks had such a strong quarter. We had so many records in quarterly OI and revenue numbers. Shanghai, not to not pay attention to them, but they too had growth. They had growth in attendance, guest spending, revenue and operating income. And the new pricing system that Bob referenced does take place on June six."]], ["So my question is just kind of on how you're going to use some of your incremental cash flow you've got from tax reform, both the rate going down and the accelerated depreciation, and you've talked about a couple of billion synergies with the transaction. ", ["Well, in the earlier interview that I did on CNBC, I was asked a similar question. We've had a real blend in terms of how we've allocated our capital, increased dividends, continued share buybacks, actually got more aggressive in the last few years, and then investing both in acquisition and in organic growth. Theme parks being a great example of that with the expansion that we've talked about not just, by the way, Shanghai, but the expansion of every park and resort around the world and then the commitment to build three new cruise ships. And that's all benefited us greatly.\nAs we look forward, we believe that you'll see a similar blend, except as I said earlier too, with the acquisition of 21st Century Fox, I think, you can check that box off for a while. I don't think we're going to be in the market looking to acquire for quite a long period of time.\nIn terms of how we might allocate the other capital, I think you have to look at the film and television production as investment in organic growth. In this case, it will be aimed at growing our presence in direct-to-consumer platforms. We have not been specific yet about what incremental spend that will be. I think we were looking to say something more about that around this time of year. But since the acquisition of 21st Century Fox, that's going to shift. And until we get closer to full regulatory approval and, essentially, absorbing those assets, we're probably not likely to say something specific.\nWhat we do have that's very, very interesting that we're quite mindful of as we take these direct-to-consumer properties to market is we have the benefit of these wonderful brands. So if you look at the Disney direct-to-consumer product, which is not in the market and you haven't seen it yet, and you consider that it will be populated in terms of product by Disney, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars product, we have an opportunity to spend more on original product, of course, but not necessarily to go in the volume direction, say, that Netflix has gone because we have this unique brand proposition. And the demand for those brands, we believe, will give us the ability to spend less on volume.\nNot to suggest that we're going to be low, because we obviously are going to need enough critical mass from a product perspective. But when you go to market with Star Wars movies, Disney movies, Pixar movies, Marvel branded and branded television shows under those umbrellas, in some cases using very well-known IP, we're developing a monster series, we're developing a High School Musical series, we're developing a Star Wars series, just to name a few, that will give us the ability to probably spend less than if we had gone to market with a direct-to-consumer service without these brands."]], ["And then, Bob, you said you're looking to create and grow a global direct-to-consumer business, and your biggest competitor there just continues to increase the amount of cash they're spending on original content.

", ["Ben, I won't say too much about the Altice deal. I know you asked about the business overall, but I will say that in that deal, we met or achieved both our pricing and our distribution objectives, which bodes very well for negotiations that we will be having in 2019 and beyond, actually 2018 and beyond rather, Verizon in 2018 and Charter and AT&T Direct beyond that and then Comcast beyond that.\nWe're pleased with where we ended up. We're also pleased with trends that we're seeing on the OTT side where we've seen a nice pick-up in subs in the, basically, the new players in the market. And what we're really heartened by is the fact that some of them are spending a fair amount and have stepped up their marketing efforts aggressively. If you watched the World Series, you probably couldn't have missed the number of spots that were in almost every hour for I guess it was YouTube, new OTT service. That we think is great.\nIt's also interesting that these OTT, the entrants in the OTT business are spending in live sports. They obviously believe that the sports fan is potentially a primary customer of new OTT services, and what we've seen as well is millennials seem to be particularly interested in these services. I think it's a combination of pricing and the user-friendly nature of these services.\nAs we've said call after call, we've had some sub issues that we've been dealing with, but Christine's comment suggested that while we lost some subs in the quarter, the losses were not as deep as they have been in prior quarters. And we're not \u2013 we're heartened by that as well. But it is one quarter. The other thing I want to note that's interesting, this ties into your question about the health of the business, is that Nielsen provided us with two weeks of data, which was essentially data about live consumption of sports across multiple platforms, including streaming and these OTT services.\nAnd what they told us was that by including that we had a 25% increase in total day ratings and a 29% increase among \u2013 in primetime. That was basically, that includes out-of-home viewing as well. So we think that the trends that we're seeing, albeit they're still not lengthy trends, but are at least giving us some reason to feel good about the business. We've always felt we were positioned well in it because of ESPN and Disney and ABC.\nAnd on the direct-to-consumer front, as we've said as well, that we're going into that business because we believe that our direct-to-consumer opportunities, given the technology that's out there, are significant and given the fact that we've got these great brands and franchises. And we think that what we're doing can easily be complementary to the multichannel services in the market, both the traditional ones and the new ones.\nAnd when you see the apps that we will demonstrate sometime after the first of the year, you'll see that we're coming up \u2013 we're developing one app experiences where ESPN's app will enable the highlights and scores that ESPN typically gives, will enable live streaming of the channels on an authenticated basis. And will also add a Plus service, which will enable users to subscribe to for an extra fee to thousands more live sporting events a year.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.\nBen, to answer your question on the 2018 spend, in my comments I mentioned the BAMTech investment that was going to impact Cable operating income by $130 million. That's BAMTech, but on the Disney D2C, we don't expect any significant items to impact spend in 2018."]], ["And how do you think about the tipping point on addressability across all Disney advertising-related platforms?\nAnd then just, Christine, if we could just follow up on some of the CapEx questions, can you talk about the cadence at all beyond fiscal 2018? ", ["Jessica, on the first question, we're going launch ESPN service in the spring. That obviously will be advertiser supported. BAMTech, as we said at your conference, and as I said in my remarks earlier, offers us some \u2013 far more, I should say, capabilities when it relates to, as it relates to addressable ads live \u2013 inserted live on a dynamic basis into live sporting events. And so we feel that that gives us a lot of capability that we haven't had before.\nWhether that extends, that capability extends to our other businesses in the non-direct to consumer, I'm not sure. We're currently not planning to sell ads on the Disney service, but that's just in development. There may be some interesting possibilities in terms of sponsorships versus inserted ads. But as of now, we're not planning to have the programming that airs in the OTT \u2013 sorry, the DTC service interrupted by commercials.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.\nJessica, on CapEx, you see for this year that we gave the comment that you can expect CapEx for 2018 to be about $1 billion above the 2017 level. And once again, a lot of that spend is going into the completion of the two Star Wars Lands and we're also completing Toy Story Land in Orlando and there's other initiatives that are in process around the globe. We've talked about the longer-term menu and I think at some of the meetings we've had, we've talked about the longer-term plans for our Parks and Resort business and developing out further on attractions and resorts. So I think it's fair to assume that we will continue to make investments in areas in which we see driving long-term value and long-term returns. So I would say this is a business that we feel very confident in and the business is working right now at a very high level and will continue to do so.\nRobert A. Iger - The Walt Disney Co.\nThe other thing to add to that is when you look at the results of our international parks, Shanghai, as Christine cited, and the improvements we're seeing in Paris and the restructuring in Paris as well as Hong Kong and even Tokyo, we have ample opportunity to continue to invest and continue to expand those businesses. And with the franchises that we have and their popularity in these markets, the opportunity actually has increased significantly over the last few years."]], ["In other words, you could go and sort of spend large and sort of say there's only going be one or two winners on the back end of this evolution and Disney's going be one of them. ", ["Sure. Before I do that, because there's been a lot written about whether this is aimed at being a Netflix killer, et cetera, and so on. By the way, they've been a good partner of ours. Our goal here is be a viable player in the direct-to-consumer space, space that we all know is a very, very compelling space to be in. We also believe that our brands and our franchises really matter, as we've seen through Netflix and all other platforms. And so that gives us an opportunity as well. We are working on the cadence that we will produce in sort of scheduled product in this OTT service. We've not determined fully what that will be, although we've laid out on a calendar basis a fair amount of specifics. We're still working to develop original movies and original TV shows and figure out what makes the most sense.

", ["We've not had conversations with our distributors. As we enter a new round of distribution negotiations, we have all the confidence in the world and our ability to strike deals that are favorable to the company, given the strength of the product that we offer, particularly the strength of the brands.\nIf you look very specifically at ESPN, we still see it as a must-have service for the multichannel providers because of the array of product that ESPN has licensed, and what they produce is original programming for the service. We have seen, as I think that many of you have, a pretty interesting and dramatic increase in, I'll call it, app-based media consumption. Much of it is on over-the-top direct-to-consumer services.\nAnd in our 33% investment in BAM a year ago, we got a real good perspective \u2013 or gained a good perspective on just how strong and high quality that product is and felt that, given the trends we're seeing in the marketplace, given the strength of the ESPN brand, and given how robust this platform is, it gave us an opportunity to really take advantage of all of this, the combination of all these things.\nAnd so we accelerated our right to buy control of the service, basically so that we can have even more control of our own destiny, but it's also something that the partners of BAMTech, notably Major League Baseball and National Hockey League concurred with.\nAnd so this gives us the ability to launch a new service, one that we've been talking about, but it will be even more robust than the one we anticipated. In the first year of operation, it should offer consumers approximately 10,000 additional live sporting events over what ESPN offers on its linear networks. This is a combination of the contribution of the partners, as well as what BAMTech has licensed, as well as what ESPN will provide and has also licensed to BAMTech.\nWe're creating a one-app experience so that from a consumer perspective there's a real ease-of-use and ease-of-navigation, so that you can as an ESPN fan, you can use \u2013 go to one app, look at scores and highlights as you know the ESPN provides, authenticate it to watch the linear networks or buy up or buy an additional amount of live sports programming basically in the same experience on the same service. That's essentially it.\nIt does give us optionality in the future. If we see changes in the distribution model, if we see either greater erosion or bigger opportunity to migrate the linear networks to a more direct-to-consumer proposition, we certainly have the technology to do it, and it can be done under relatively seamless circumstances. But we're not currently anticipating doing that as we launch this new app."]], ["And just on the Disney-branded direct-to-consumer service, Bob, as you, I'm sure, are well aware one of the beauties of Netflix model is its global, and so you're talking about a massive footprint to leverage your content. ", ["Well, one of the beauties of the Disney brand is just how global it is and how strong the fan base of Disney is globally. Interestingly enough, Netflix did not have global rights to our Disney movies. They bought opportunistically in certain markets.\nSo what we see doing on the Disney front is we will take our Disney-branded, Pixar-branded movies that had been part of the Netflix paying agreement starting with the calendar 2019 slate \u2013 by the way, that will include Lion King, Frozen 2, and Toy Story, among others. We'll migrate those, in effect pay window Disney Pixar movies, to a subscription Disney-branded service.\nWe'll also tap into a vast library of movies and television shows that have been made by the company, the Channel and the Studio over the years, and we'll invest significantly in original movies and television shows exclusively for this subscription service.\nWe'll also rollout the service in multiple markets outside the United States, but it will vary from market to market based on existing distribution agreements and different market dynamics. But I think you have to think about a Disney branded direct-to-consumer subscription service as a global product, even though we are being more specific today about launching a domestic product in the latter part of 2019."]], ["Bob, continuing along this theme, I'm just curious, are there restrictions in your current MVPD deals that hold you back from taking ESPN over-the-top, you know, the main channel until you're fully through the renewal cycle? ", ["I'm not going to comment specifically about the agreements. There are elements to the agreement that \u2013 well, first of all, if we wanted to take ESPN direct, we could. There are elements to the distribution agreements that we have that would cause us to if we were to bring the service direct to the consumer or create some \u2013 I'll call them sub-optimal circumstances for us. I'm not going to get into detail about that.\nIf we were to create a direct-to-consumer app that had the linear services, just as Netflix is distributed by multichannel servers out there or product out there, we would give our distributors an opportunity to distribute our app and other third parties as well."]], ["So other than the specific output that you identified from Disney and Pixar, and then we talked about Marvel and Lucasfilm, all the other relationships you have with Netflix in terms of licensed ABC content and kids content and original content for Netflix, is it safe to assume that you intend to continue partnering with them and doing work with them as makes sense over the future? ", ["There is no change from our side. I can't speak for them, but we've had a great relationship with them. We made a decision some years back to license them the Studio output deal. They paid us well for that, and they did well as well. It represented real anchor programming for Netflix before they had an opportunity to ramp up their own original production, which they've obviously done aggressively and quite successfully.\nThe Marvel relationship is a perfect example of how well we've done with them in terms of creating original product. That's been very mutually beneficial. It's done well for them. They leveraged the strength of the Marvel brand, and it's done well for us as we mined our IP and obviously made money from it.\nThey've also licensed a number of ABC shows. We hope they'll continue to do that. This doesn't represent a change except on the Disney Pixar side, and as I cited earlier, possibly on the output deal for Marvel and Star Wars films, which we're still discussing and debating."]], ["And so I know you won't comment on what you expect them to do, but I'm sure you've thought through the different scenarios that this could play out and the reactions ripple through the industry.\nI guess the specific best way I can phrase the question is a specific concern that many people have is if this causes more of your peers and competitors to go direct themselves, that you could imagine a non-sports better quality direct offering coming to be in some way that would perhaps be appealing to lots of households who maybe don't care about sports. ", ["I'm still trying to get, figure out who's the peer and who's the competitor. We've kicked around a number of scenarios here, and frankly, the discussion that we've had isn't something that we necessarily want to disclose to the outside world. Frankly, I'm not sure that this step is going to make much of a difference in terms of the, we'll call it, the disposition of the health of the multichannel ecosystem.\nI think there are forces, whether they're technological in nature or sociological or economic in nature, out there that are changing the way media is consumed in general, and I don't think this is either going to hasten them or exacerbate things in any way. What it does do, though, is a couple of things.\nFirst of all, it gives us the ability to leverage the strength of our brands, which a lot of our peers and competitors do not have. Secondly, it gives us what we'd call optionality. It's a word I've not used very much in my life, but it gives us the flexibility, really, to move our product to the consumer in many new ways, ways that we've not been able to do before, because of just how strong this platform is that we bought control of.\nWe are very excited about that. We think it sets this company up well no matter what changes occur in the media ecosystem. I think if there's a headline, it would be one Disney leveraging its brands to take advantage of technological and consumer trends, and giving us flexibility if there is major shifts or continuing changes that occur in the marketplace, which, right now, no one else has."]], ["Philosophically on pricing of these over-the-top apps, it seems like there is at least a handful of ways you could approach it, the one is maybe the way Amazon or Netflix do it where you could argue it's underpriced and they're either trying to drive Prime memberships or gain first-mover advantage.

With a slate of Marvel films that goes well into the next decade, and the same with the Star Wars front \u2013 on the Star Wars front and probably the strongest slate of Disney films that we've ever had in development, you have to consider the options from a revenue-generating perspective that that provides us in multiple windows, in multiple ways, whether it is licensed to third parties in a variety of forms or whether it's proprietary on our services, meaning subscription, et cetera, and so on.\nI also think you have to consider global trends in the direction of, as I said earlier, app based media consumption, over direct-to-consumer OTT services, which gives us the ability to improve our fortunes in terms of how we monetize the great IP and the strong brands that we have, whether it's in increased advertising revenue, whether it's in the, basically the value creation proposition of knowing the consumer better and mining data more effectively; whether it's in basically creating stronger bonds or stronger brand affinity.\nWe've got this unbelievably passionate base of Disney consumers worldwide, and virtually all of our businesses except theme parks, we've never had the opportunity to even connect with them directly and know who they are. And it's high-time that we got into the business, particularly with the technology available to us, to accomplish that.\nOnce we do, and this gives us the ability to do it, then I think the monetization possibilities are extraordinary for this company. There will be some sacrifices. Obviously, as you move product from, I'll call it, a licensed to third-party model to a self-distributed model, you're foregoing the licensing revenue that you'll get for whatever revenues you generate by all the things that I just described.\nWe believe that ultimately, I can't give you an idea of when or how long, the profitability, the revenue-generating capability of this initiative is substantially greater than the business models that we're currently being served by."]], ["So given you have better information than we do, maybe you could just elaborate a bit on that why you're optimistic and raising the buyback to boot?\nAnd then on the Studio side, people obviously are nervous a bit about sort of the profitability levels being at peak margins for the Studio. ", ["Well, I'll touch upon the last one first. Given the success of the Studio to date, the last few years, and given the slate that is ahead, there isn't a studio that is more important to the distributors than The Walt Disney Company, particularly when you consider the amount and the brands, Pixar, Marvel, Disney, and of course, Star Wars. And when you look at the slate coming up with Pirates and Cars and Thor and Coco and The Last Jedi, and more Marvel movies; Black Panther and Avengers and Han Solo, Incredibles and Ant-Man, and I could go on, we have a really great relationship with the distributors. We've enabled them to grow and they are enabling us to grow, and we believe that more growth will and should come from that business.\nOne of the reasons why we're not engaged in discussions on this premium VOD window is because what we've got going is working and we have no reason to disrupt that right now. We are making movies that people want to see in the large screen venues that are being built worldwide. And that gives us some leverage with them, yes, but it's also very mutually beneficial.\nThe buyback, we feel confident in where the company is going. We obviously have a great balance sheet. We have the wherewithal to continue to access capital to not only invest in some of the things that we talked about but to manage expansion down the road. And so this is \u2013 as you know, we've had a blend of ways that we're returning capital to our shareholders with increased dividends, continued buybacks, and of course, very, very successful large acquisitions when the opportunity has come along and growth in our stock. So this is just part of what has been an ongoing strategy. And as Christine mentioned, because of some reduction in capital expenses that we expected this year, we felt we had excess capital and looking at opportunities to pass that back to shareholders we thought particularly given what we see as the future of our company that this was a good buy for us and a good buy for our shareholders.\nThis is a long \u2013 you asked a lot of questions. On the distribution and the ESPN front and the new OTT platforms, first of all, give us a little bit of credit for being very candid with all of you on an earnings call two summers ago when we talked about sub losses in the expanded basic bundle. We did that because, one, we wanted to be candid; and two, we wanted to signal that we had our eyes wide open about what was going on and we fully intended to address what we were seeing and what we've continued to see. It enabled us to take a number of steps to deal with the issue in a way that long-term will serve this company very well. And what we've done is we have negotiated deals with all these new distributors.\nBy the way, they've concluded that launching new platforms without ESPN is very challenged. Launching it with ESPN gives them an ability to penetrate the marketplace in ways that they wouldn't be able to without it. And so we're \u2013 we've done deals, as you know, with Sony Vue and AT&T Direct and Sling and YouTube, which launched a month ago, and Hulu most recently, and there are others entering the marketplace. We've seen really nice growth there, but it's nascent, and the growth that we've seen in number of subs so far has not made up for the losses that we have seen in the expanded basic service.\nThose losses have come from cord-nevers, cord-cutters and what had been a migration to lighter packages on those platforms that did not include ESPN. It has been a blend, and it's been fairly steady, which is why we continued to focus on distributing on these new platforms, which we think provide opportunities for us and for consumers in a variety of ways. First of all, they are more user-friendly. The interface is typically better because it's newer. They are more mobile-friendly as well. The combination of those as well as the pricing we believe makes them more attractive to people in lower economic brackets as well as a new generation or a younger generation of consumers. And that is very, very important to us.\nLive sports works on those platforms, and young consumers want live sports. And we've got the best array of them. And so we continue to engage with them. We continue to feel optimistic about what we're seeing. We're also mindful of what's going on with what I'll call the traditional business, which is why we are doing what we're doing with our apps business, which is why we're invested in BAMTech because we believe another area of growth for this company is in the direct-to-consumer space, not just with ESPN but with our other brands, and not just in the U.S. but worldwide. And we intend to launch an ESPN-branded service direct-to-consumer by the end of the year. And a lot's been said about the cost reductions at ESPN. We're managing that business efficiently. We always have. We always will.\nObviously, there's probably a greater need to do it given some of the challenges that we've seen near term, but frankly, what we've been doing in terms of scale, in terms of size, is not all that significant when you consider that ESPN has 8,000 employees and we reduced by about 100 a few weeks ago. I don't take it lightly. But the number was \u2013 it gets headlines, but when you think about it in the scheme of things, or if you just look at it against basically the number of on-air people that ESPN has, it wasn't a particularly significant number or reduction. But we do believe we need to manage it more efficiently. And we also continue \u2013 we will continue to be aggressive at buying live sports rights, which have not gotten cheaper, we understand, but they have gotten more valuable.

We also have that first full quarter of Shanghai operations in the third quarter, so that'll also impact our expense growth.

Iger - The Walt Disney Co.\nI think as it relates to, I'll say, margins, I think you were asking more about cost savings, is when we look at margin expansion, we're not just looking at cost savings.

And in order to offer the experience that we offer, we operate these parks across the globe at an industry-leading level or an industry-leading way. The quality of service is part of our \u2013 the brand proposition of our parks to the world, quite frankly, and that takes a cost structure that needs to be supported. We always look, though, to run it more efficiently. Technology has been our friend in that regard. Some of the steps that we've taken already by deploying technology, whether it's on the sales front, the ticketing front or the overall customer interaction or whether it's on the operations front, have obviously helped.\nBut there are also opportunities on the pricing front. I talked about them earlier. It's not just about raising prices. It's about a strategic approach to pricing that are also designed not only to increase attendance but to improve margins. So we don't look at it just as a savings initiative. We look at it as a combination of revenue generation and cost efficiency, combined obviously with no loss of service \u2013 of quality of service, which is imperative for us.\nChristine M.

So we're not \u2013 I'm sorry, about $800 million in global box office. So we don't think that there's a coincidence to this, and while obviously because we're dealing in a creative business there's risk associated. We think that we've done a really great job of de-risking the business.\nThen that's a combination of the franchises we have and obviously the stories that we're mining, but also the talent that we have at the company or that we are attracting to the company to make those films. And we have a lot of visibility into the early part of the next decade of the film slate. And we feel great about the projects that have been chosen and the progress that has been made on them."]], ["Bob, last quarter you talked about both on the earnings call and I think at some conferences, digital distribution as a question mark and something that the company was thinking about strategically.

And it is sizable. The whole experience is sizable. And it is an add-on to Animal Kingdom, which has always been a good park but has never been a full-day experience. So we included or we added within the last year a nighttime Safari experience and some other entertainment.\nAnd by adding this, we're going to be turning what is our fourth gate, the last one to be opened in Orlando, into a much fuller experience and that gives it a lot of potential. It's also the biggest new land that we've opened in Florida in a very long time and I think that's good for the whole business down there. And to the extent that we can know this, we really believe that in the coming years, that the interest in Avatar is only going to grow as those movies enter the marketplace.

And it is sizable. The whole experience is sizable. And it is an add-on to Animal Kingdom, which has always been a good park but has never been a full-day experience. So we included or we added within the last year a nighttime Safari experience and some other entertainment.\nAnd by adding this, we're going to be turning what is our fourth gate, the last one to be opened in Orlando, into a much fuller experience and that gives it a lot of potential. It's also the biggest new land that we've opened in Florida in a very long time and I think that's good for the whole business down there.

", ["Todd, first question on kids programming, you're right, we've seen a decline ratings-wise in kids viewing overall on linear channels. I don't want to speak for the industry, but I'll speak for Disney. And I think that's the result of a couple of things. One, I'll call it a bit of an off cycle in terms of programming; and two, a proliferation of kids programming in a variety of other places.\nTo the first part of the answer, we have just debuted a show called Mickey Mouse Roadster Racers (sic) [Mickey and the Roadster Racers] (36:01) that's done extremely well. We have a Tangled series that's hitting soon and a lot of \u2013 and a product cycle over the next year to two years that we feel great about. And so we think that the ratings are likely to improve with the addition of some new shows that we think creatively are very strong.\nIn addition to that, I think we stand a chance of doing really well no matter what the environment is from a disruption perspective because of that name, Disney, and what it means to the consumer. And I think that will result in a couple of things: greater demand for \u2013 to license our product on other direct-to-consumer platforms: Hulu, Netflix, examples of that. And also the possibility of us taking Disney-branded television programming direct to the consumer.\nThat's what we're doing in the U.K. with DisneyLife. It's a combination of movies, television programming, and then other Disney properties like digital books and music, for instance. We're still in, what I'll call, an experimental stage, because we've been learning more and more about technology platform, churn rates, pricing, those sorts of things. But we do know that we have a brand and the product behind it to be able to take it direct-to-consumer. So I think as we look at the future of our kids programming, we look at it in all likelihood as probably a blend of linear channels, some third-party licensing arrangements and also direct-to-consumer properties.\nAnd this is not just for the United States. I had an interesting meeting with our country manager in India recently, where we own a number of channels. And he was talking about the opportunities there from Netflix and Amazon and discussing the possibility of licensing more to them. And the other thing, by the way, you have to think about is some of that licensing doesn't have to be off network. It could be original programming as we've done with Netflix and Marvel.\nSo the demand for Disney is huge from the consumer perspective and from a distribution perspective. And again we're seeing I think a world where disruption is definitely on the table and real. But it's not something that we feel is daunting in terms of the task ahead.\nChristine M. McCarthy - The Walt Disney Co.\nSo, Todd, to answer your question on pension. As you saw the first page of our press release in the first table we showed cash from operations. You saw it down pretty significantly from a year ago. But if you account for that, if you adjust for the $1.3 billion of pension contribution that we made in the quarter, it more than offsets that decline.\nYou mentioned rising rates. And rising rates will definitely benefit our pension going forward. In our 10-Q we \u2013 I believe the 10-Q had explicitly stated that for each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate, our pension liability would decrease by about $2.4 billion. So that being said, rising rates are certainly going to benefit us.\nAs it relates to pension expense for the year, we don't expect to change from what we had talked about in our last conference call. And after this $1.3 billion that we put in, in the first quarter, there shouldn't be any meaningful contributions for the balance of the year."]], ["It seems like at some level it fundamentally changes your relationship, though, with the leagues in that in the past you would buy sports rights and then resell them to the pay-TV distributors and now it seems like your equity incentives are more aligned in a way. ", ["Well, I think there's a yes and no to that. I think it will be both. We don't see ourselves getting out of, what I'll call, the linear ESPN multi-channel service for a while. We do see ourselves, I mentioned, adding, through BAMTech, a direct-to-consumer proposition that will, in all likelihood, include a lot of sports and sports from some entities that we license content from for ESPN. Baseball is actually one example of that. I don't think it fundamentally changes the relationship. I guess it's in a way it creates a different form of partnership but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing."]], ["And I just want to ask, is this would you say weaker demand or is there something else at play here and as we think about the normal attendance levels going forward, should we think about those as being flattish except for, of course, the timing of holiday periods? ", ["Okay. On the parks, as you noted, we did have a lot of comparability factors and once again there is a lapping of the 60th, the Hurricane Matthew, and also the impact of the shift of holiday periods. We also, as was noted previously in the call, we did introduce seasonal pricing a year ago and we are seeing some shift in some of our demand to try to smooth attendance over those peak demand periods. So I don't think you should read too much into the attendance.\nOver the same period that you're noting, we've also seen strong increases in per cap spending. It was up 7% in the quarter, which we gave you. And so that's more than offset the impact of the attendance decline. And we also have some new offerings, as Bob mentioned, Avatar, there's also Guardians of the Galaxy coming this summer at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim. So we think these new offerings are going to stimulate future demand and I don't think you should read too much into this one quarter. On the change in payables, that decline is related to the pension plan contribution of $1.3 billion."]], ["I guess just from a high level I just wanted to kind of go back to the 5% to 7% EBITDA growth target you guys outlined at the Analyst Day last year. ", ["Yes. I think you've nailed it. I mean I think it is we do have tougher comps there with those wildfires. Those pretty much turned off last year at the very end of July. So we've got seven months of tough comps there. Obviously you can't predict whether there's something else that comes up throughout the year.\nIf something else did happen whether it's a natural disaster or a big project that we don't anticipate then that would help to offset that. But for now we felt like 5.2% was a reasonable number within the previously communicated range of 5% to 7% as you say at the lower end of that but we still feel confident that we'll get there. And I think that's we do feel like we've got an economy that provides a pretty good support for hitting within that 5% to 7% range.\nI think when you see us get up towards 7% is when you'll start to see a couple of these headwinds that we've talked about for probably two years now really starting to kind of recover fully and that means recycling. That means some consistency in RIN pricing then you'll see us in the 7% possibly even exceeding 7%. But with just solid waste you're talking about a 5-plus percent number that's probably double the overall economy. It shows you how strong solid waste is."]], ["And I guess just a key takeaway here is that we're running at 2.5% whereas you guys had a longer-term outlook of 2% on the price which I think is probably pretty notable. ", ["I think when you look at 2019 Jim's mentioned earlier about those two items that we're not planning for and certainly are not items that we expect to recur. Those two items if we adjust for those we would have delivered SG&A as a percentage of revenue up 10% in the year. And so we remain committed to that target over the long term. And what you see in addition to those two items are the impact of the ADS integration planning work that we're doing we did adjust for those and we'll continue to adjust for those in the year ahead and then my mention of our enterprise resource planning efforts that we started in the fourth quarter.\nSo those two items will elevate the level of reported SG&A above 10%. But when we call those out and really focus on the fundamental investment in the organization from a technology perspective you're absolutely right things like investments in our call center technology where we should be able to serve our customer online rather than having them call into our call center to get information about their accounts or their service will drive a reduction in SG&A over the long term.\nBut right now what we see is the incremental investment of that dollar into technology and our people is going to position us to want to continue to maintain SG&A as a percent of revenue at 10% rather than allow it to tick down because we think that those investments are worthwhile and great incremental value for the long term."]], ["Jim or John big picture question but I want to come back to that 4.5% MSW yield print this quarter the 3.8% for the year which I felt like was if not the biggest one of the biggest stories of 2019. ", ["Well look Tyler I think one does kind of get the other. But as we've talked about landfill pricing for probably a decade we've never really been able to establish any consistency there. And that's I think you're absolutely right. I think you pinpointed it and that is that it's one of the big stories for 2019 for us that we were able to as I said in my remarks get a strong MSW price number that is starting to approximate that cost structure that we've also talked about every quarter for the last two years.\nI mean we keep talking about how our cost structure is going up by 5% and MSW is going up by 1% and we're finally getting to a point where we're starting to close the gap there. And so that's a big deal for us. And we're starting to do it on a consistent basis.\nI think our customers understand that things like leachate costs which have been a topic of discussion for two years here that leachate costs are going up and they're going up really on a permanent basis that labor costs continue to go up. So this is a it's a very big story. It's a story that we've ultimately talked about for a long time but never really been able to nail down. And now we're finally able to say we feel like landfill pricing is really here to stay.\nJohn Morris\nTyler I would add to that. We are equally as focused on the transfer station pricing as well as part of the post collection network. You've heard us talk about pressure on subcontracting costs and whatnot. So when you look at it I in particular the team are working hard at what we're doing on the transfer side.\nWe talked about residential. I mean if you look at our residential core price and yield it's going up. It's progressing. And we talked about volume there could be some volume pressure there. But I think it would deliver better margins and better returns when you walk all the way through the network. I think we're comfortable with that.\nJames Fish\nWell I think one last thing here Tyler. When we talk about it's a little bit of an add-on to what John said there. But when you talk about margin improvement you might say \"Well gosh I mean you're not even covering your cost increase there with your landfill. What are you so excited about?\" Look I mean I would tell you that 4.5% is better than 1%.\nSo while we may not be covering that cost increase which is kind of pushing 5% of the landfills it still is going to add to our margins similarly on the resi line of business which is really the one collection line of business that's seen margin degradation over a period of five to 10 years falling I don't know John almost in half over a period of 10 years that that line of business will also start to affect overall margins even though we will not get back to where we were 10 years ago for quite some time. So while we're while a lot of this is really just cost recovery cost recovery it's cost recovery that we weren't doing in the past. So and we've got to get there now. And I think consistently we're starting to show that."]], ["And then Devina just a little bit I think implied in your guidance you're looking for maybe a 40 basis point improvement in EBITDA margins in 2020 if my math is correct. ", ["No I think your math is good. On those items that you mentioned certainly we do think that there's some dilution to margin. Although at some point that kind of flattens out from a margin perspective because we're not projecting any meaningful growth in recycling or RINs in the year ahead. So the impact to margin should be relatively flat. But your point on fuel tax credit that definitely will be dilutive to margin in the year ahead. The outlook for collection and disposal continues to be that 50 to 100 basis points.\nSo your 60 to 80 that you mentioned is right in that range. Jim John's mentioned of M100 the focus on MSDO for repair and maintenance and then one of the items that we've not mentioned yet today but I think really is driving some productivity from a margin perspective is our turnover. Our turnover improved about 150 basis points during the year and we think that we can continue to march forward on those goals and objectives with the focus on people for Waste Management."]], ["You all have a asset mix and geographic concentration that would lend itself to consistently producing a good volume number relative to a comparison, because of the nature of that mix. ", ["Yes, I would say that what we can talk about and you've hit on it with the 16 of 20 largest MSAs having the best-placed assets in those markets. What that's about is being well placed in markets that we see growth. And so at Waste Management, we focus extensively on not just leveraging the best asset network in the business today, but thinking about how we will be positioned to leverage that asset network over the long term. And where, when you look at the North American economy, we see urbanization as a trend and one that is benefiting those well-placed assets.\nJohn Morris\nYes. One thing I would add to that Michael is that we talked a lot about the investment we're making in digital and the digital team has done a great job. And the reason we're doing this is to differentiate ourselves. So we obviously feel differentiated with our asset network, we wanted to add a second form of differentiation which is bringing a different digital approach to our customers, both internal and external customers. There would be couple of examples here. We rolled out on open market residential tool probably a year or so ago and now 40% of all of our new open market residential customers are going through that tool. It's been very well received. The feedback from our customer base has been excellent.\nWe think that 40% number will eventually go to a much higher number in fact, it will -- in short order, I think it will be the majority, meaning over 50% of those customers that come in, will go directly through that new customer-facing digital application. The commercial tool, which rolled out only a couple of months ago, has certainly a much lower number than that 40%, but it is growing at a fast pace.\nIn fact, the last number that I heard was that we -- that that number is tripling. So we think that in addition to having a really good, in fact, best-in-class network of assets, we are rightly spending dollars in the digital space to differentiate ourselves. So differentiation will not just be in terms of asset location, but it will be in terms of customer-facing technology."]], ["Devina, on the capital spending, cash flow and all of that, can I wrap a ribbon around -- you said we would be higher than $1.75 billion, but you didn't say what that number should be for us to model for the remainder of the year. ", ["Sure. So I'll take the capital spending piece first. And if you look at capital spending through nine months, we are at $1.532 billion. So rounding out the back part of the year, we think that will be around $1.8 billion. We've provided a range in our press release tables that shows $1.775 billion to $1.825 billion as kind of an indication of where we think we will end up. From a cash flow from operations perspective, that really is one of the best indicators of how we're performing and conversion of revenue to cash from ops is certainly a strength and we are up 60 basis points through nine months. I expect you'll see us finish strong, and right now, every indication is 24.6% would effectively, if we rounded out there, that's a 70-basis point improvement for the full year."]], ["And John, I hope you can follow me here, but if I was to break your recycling business maybe into two buckets, so basically where you own a MRF and you've got a third-party tipping and then maybe where you're hauling and tipping either at your own or another person's MRF, so maybe think about it those two ways.\nSo basically, is it the situation that when you're taking in third-party volume into your own MRF, are you guys fully earning an adequate return on that line, and really the pain is in recycling, where you sit in an old contract where you're picking up and hauling and taking it either internally or elsewhere. ", ["Here's the way I would answer that Tyler is, is there are certain aspects of this recycling issue that have been easier to address. Certainly, the open market commercial customers would be ones that we kind of refer to that as Phase II, Phase I is more about recycling material coming into our MRF where it does get more challenging is where we're taking recycling material to a third party, or where we're to use your phrase stuck in a contract that -- that's what we kind of refer to as Phase III in our plan and to an earlier question, we're about halfway through that process, but that is more of a pain point than the first two areas that I referenced."]], ["Yes, I mean, basically, it seems with the processing fees, it's easier if it's coming in from a third party, that's more addressable quickly and believe me, I know all about you're open market because you guys hauled for me and I'm in a resi subscription model and you've changed my bill. ", ["It's just third phase Tyler but in your point you've bifurcated that one other time, I mean between we have those contracts we're processing or picking up and processing ourselves. And then we have contracts we're picking up and for whatever the reason we're having somebody else process that. But that is the third phase and that is the one that's obviously got a longer tail on it in terms of working our way through all the contract terms.\nDevina Rankin\nAnd to your point about returns. I think what's really important there is it's not just the MRF itself that we're looking for the return on. We're looking at the investment that we make in the truck and the driver in order to provide that. And so it's ensuring that we address that part of the business for the long-term returns and viability of recycling overall to get return is not just on the MRF but on the collection assets as well."]], ["I know we're coming up on the hour or past it, just I know you mentioned Jim, I think, California, you said it's wrapped up in August, can you just help us on the wildfires and the cleanup in the first nine months, is that -- is that close to like a $0.10 EPS benefit. ", ["I don't have the year number that -- the quarter number was a $9 million impact on EBIT and $10.7 million impact on revenues.\nDevina Rankin\nSo from an EBITDA perspective, it was ballpark $40 million for the year.\nJohn Morris\nI think what's important there. Michael, this is John, it's -- we've called out the wildfires for sure really unfortunate circumstances that we are obviously helping those folks cleanup, but we kind of look at that, we've commented before, we have kind of those puts and takes in the business, it seems like every year in different geographies. So, it's easy to strip out California, but in fairness, we could go back and look at year-to-date '18 and Q3 in '18, there are some puts and takes there as well. So it is a little bit, it's hard to just say hey, we're going to strip out California from the math but not look at the past year, but as we commented, we really haven't adjusted a lot of that because we look at that is kind of the way the business runs year in and year out. And that's been a historical experience we've had.\nDevina Rankin\nWell, and to John's point on year in, year out. I do think it's worth commenting that the wildfire impacts did start in 2018 and our fourth quarter of 2018 had about $12 million of wildfire impacts in it. So when you think about the comps that we have in Q4, that's one of the items that we have our eye on."]], ["The 3.6% second straight quarter, can you just help us understand, what is out there in the market right now that should give us confidence that there is momentum there that we could kind of look at that number going forward rather than stepping back in to the, the old years, in old cycles where pricing was a little bit more competitive.\nIs it something with the cost pressure seeing at the landfill that -- that the market now can start passing that through. ", ["Yeah, Michael, I think you've touched on a couple of pieces there. It's -- part of it is -- is an increased focus through the use of data and analytics. We brought that to -- to the collection side of the business as probably seven years or eight years ago, and we've really transitioned that over to the landfill line of business. And now, there is -- not only a use of data and analytics, but there is a real focus on it from our Senior VPs as they work with their teams in the field. So that certainly is having an impact.\nI think, there may be -- some of it that is -- is kind of necessarily as a result of -- of few other cost categories going up, specifically transportation-related costs and leachate management certainly are climbing at a, at a rate higher than CPI, but -- but I think some of it is just sort of recognition on our part that -- that these are really critical assets that we have to earn a better return on them, they're very capital intensive.\nAnd so I would say that that 4% core price in landfills and 3.6% MSW yield on the heels of 3.4% is good, but I still think there is opportunity to increase that at our landfills and transfer stations, not just to keep up with inflation in certain cost categories, but to help us expand margins and to me, that's kind of a breath of fresh air after -- it feels like it's decade of 1% yield at the landfill."]], ["Can you just talk about what that might mean for us, thinking about that going to 2020 and are some of your business lines clearly seeing cost inflation above CPI and the market is going to still have to try to raise pricing to offset that? ", ["Yeah, sure, Michael, I will -- really on inflation and CPI specifically, it's really been flat for the flattish. I mean, it was down, I think 10 basis points for the quarter. But we didn't see really much in the way of tailwinds from CPI as it was creeping up over the last few quarters and now, it started to reverse course a little bit. We're not anticipating much in the way of a headwind.\nAs you said, we do have some cost categories that are, that are outpacing inflation. And so as a result, we've tried to transition some of our pricing of contracts over to that water sewer trash index that -- that is more representative of our overall cost structure, but there also, there are also a few cost categories that are, that are not increasing at the same rate, such as fuel.\nSo overall, I think, we're -- we're kind of a bit above that CPI, but we don't expect to see much of a headwind as we move out towards the latter half of '19 and into '20, unless something really changes dramatically. I don't anticipate much of a headwind on the price side from CPI softening."]], ["I can fully appreciate that there's only so much you guys would want to disclose in the middle of this process, but it would be helpful if you could let us know, how this review has been tracking relative to initial expectations. ", ["Yeah, fair enough. This is John. I think, in terms of what we've experienced to-date. I think, it's tracking about as we expected from a timing standpoint, a process standpoint. Clearly, we're not far enough along where we can really start to add any more color or detail as we said in the prepared remarks, we still think the first quarter of 2020 is on track. I will tell you, the process so far has not yielded any surprises.\nWe're continuing to do everything we can from a regulatory standpoint to make the process with the DOJ goes as expeditiously as it can. So in terms of next steps, again, we're not far off along in the process -- far enough along in the process for us to really add any additional color.

I think, we all can empathize with you on the -- hear in patience here because, but unfortunately when it comes to things like synergies, we gave that original $100 million number, but we don't know any more at this point, because they are still operating as a separate company and we have not -- besides that, we have a team in there kind of diving in right now, that team won't go in and dive in until -- until we close the transaction.\nAnd then in a -- in very short order, we will know whether that $100 million is conservative or not.

The real kind of indicators that reflect the health of the industrial segments are special waste primarily, and then also, there's a component of it within C&D and maybe even MSW. But largely special waste and that special waste pipeline looks -- look still very strong, I mean, I think there's -- and there is reason for optimism there even on things like coal combustion residuals down the road.\nSo it -- a little bit of that speaks to the lumpiness that we see in our overall business that we talked about early on, those things are hard to predict but they come as big chunks of business and they tend to come every year, we just have a hard time telling where they're going to be and when they're going to come. But, I would tell you that -- that this economy has been a real enigma, because it's -- there isn't a real clear sign as to the direction of it. And so we kind of have to look at our own numbers and say, what do we think as opposed to what do the pundits thinks, because the pundits think -- the Fed can't even tell you what they think about it.\nSo, right now, our numbers look to be still pretty strong. When we look at July into the month that we're in now, our volume numbers that we look at each week still look strong and they look strong in the commercial line of business, they look strong in the landfill line of business and they look fine in the roll-off line of business as well.

And so, I think, you're seeing the results of that, not just on the volume side of that part of our business but also on the price side.

We haven't seen any appreciable impact from recycling move into -- moving to our landfills, for sure. I think one of the things we mentioned on the previous call is we've had -- we have the good fortune to have a really talented team in our brokerage side of the business.

But there is an awful lot left. We've developed -- we think a really good reputation for the safe professional handling of that, but there are 700 active and inactive ash ponds in the United States that are covered by state and federal CCR regulations.\nAnd so over the next -- probably decade, those electric utilities are going -- are going to have to address, somewhere in the neighborhood of 700 million tons.

I think when we looked at weather kind of year-over-year, it was negligible between what it happened last year in different regions versus this year, so we didn\u2019t see a big impact on a year-over-year basis from weather.\nWhat I would tell you on the volume side though, and we commented that on the prepared remarks, is we continue to see obviously MSW volumes in our landfill be really strong. We had a really, really strong special waste quarter. And when we dug into that, we're seeing that across not one or two areas, but really seven or eight of our regions, which suggests a couple of things to us. One is the general overall economy is that's usually a bellwether for that. And then the pipelines we\u2019ve talked about in the back half of last year and last quarter continued to produce this year. And I think overall, I think when we will look at our volume for Q1 and trends; I think we're on pretty solid footing.\nDevina Rankin\nThe one place that I do think that we saw some weather impact is actually on the operating cost line, where we saw whether it be efficiency impacts or in the leachate cost for the Northern part of our business as we had a wetter winter season this year.

There's what we're doing on operating cost that John mentioned and what we're doing with contamination fees, and then of course there is the number which is commodity prices. And so, we\u2019re sticking with our prior comments that the recycling is going to be a tailwind for \u201819. The extent of the tailwind honestly is difficult to quantify right now because of this continued softening in commodity prices. But, really, for the year, the reason we\u2019re sticking with our prior comments about the tailwind is because of our efforts that were solely driven by contamination fees. The confirmation fees really didn't start until second quarter and they continued to ramp throughout the year. So, first quarter, should be certainly a tailwind from those and this reduced operating cost. And then, that lessens as we get through 2019.\nDevina Rankin\nIf you think -- Michael, just to add a little bit of color there, because there is so much variability that can happen in the recycling line of business. The key point there is that Waste Management\u2019s done a really good job of ensuring that commodity price volatility is no longer going to be the driver of how we think about the earnings profile of that business, moving to a model that prioritizes fee for service and getting a return on the assets that we deploy and then using technology to reduce cost over time. Those are going to be our priorities. I think that the one data point that I would additional, if you look at our estimate for average commodity prices, we ended 2018 in the $65 to $70 range for the full-year on average. We predicted that we would be at about $70 in 2019. And you guys know as well as I do that early in 2019, we are seeing levels that are softer than that. So, that's why we're hesitant to specifically give you a number that confirms what we had told you at the end of Q3.\nJohn Morris\nI think, Devina, what I would add is the beginning of the year was certainly volatile and it\u2019s reflected in our OpEx through Q2 but we've seen steady improvement in the last couple of quarters in our OpEx. And if you look at our results for Q4 in recycling despite kind of flattish commodity prices Q3 to Q4, we showed improvement.

", ["Right. So, you\u2019re right. I mean, it\u2019s -- well last year, actually on a percent of revenue, which is kind of how we look at CapEx on a percent of revenue, 11.4% of \u201818 and middle of the range is 11 percentage, maybe 10.9 this year. But keep in mind that doesn't include -- our guidance does not include capital or EBITDA for these renewable energy plants. The renewal energy plants are a way for us to close the loop. We've made a big investment in natural gas trucks. It\u2019ll be over 60% of our fleet at the end of the year, will be CNG; they are cheaper from a maintenance standpoint; there is all bunch of reasons why natural gas trucks are good for us. But, what this allows us to do because now we have such a big natural gas fleet is really close the loop through the modernization of these credits that are available to us by building these plants.\nThe reason I say that it's not in either the CapEx guidance or the EBITDA guidance is because there's a timing difference. It takes 12 to 14 months to build these plants. So, when we go through our capital committee process, if we decide that we're going to build out a renewable energy plant, the paybacks on those are excellent in three to four years. So, they\u2019re kind of no-brainers in terms of investments. But we also have to -- investors have to recognize that there is a timing difference. And we don\u2019t attempt to match them on a calendar year with the returns, simply because you're looking at a 12 to 14-month construction period for the plants. And so, the CapEx obviously takes place upfront.\nDevina Rankin\nAnd I would add on the normal capital number to your point that it being elevated from kind of those historical norms of the 10%, really has to do with the growth that we\u2019re seeing in the solid waste business. We've invested in the fleet and we're also investing in additional airspace at the landfills. I mentioned CNG and special waste volumes, both being up double digits. And so, constructing airspace to keep up with that growth is something that we\u2019re committed to. And so, those are the main drivers of the elevated spend that in a growth economy and a growth environment for our business we\u2019re certainly seeing that as a worthwhile investment."]], ["And maybe lastly, Devina, if I walk down the EBITDA to free cash flow waterfall, so I start with EBITDA add in stock comp, maybe take out closure, post closure, cash interest, cash taxes, all the CapEx, it still feels like you need a little bit of a working capital benefit to get to the free cash flow guidance.

The one thing that I would say is we have a $75 million -- I think, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had a tax planning benefit in 2018 that won't repeat. So, that does provide a little bit of a headwind, if you look at the interest and tax piece of the equation in 2019. But that is included in our guidance.

We expect to see some value there."]], ["So, you know that the volume guidance of 2%, as you said that that doesn't contemplate or include the fires, and obviously you're coming off a tough comp year-over-year including some large new contracts that you talked about.

", ["Let me start with kind of kind of -- we\u2019ve kind of broken out this -- the contamination fees in a couple of different buckets. One is municipal contracts, obviously, which I mentioned. And I would tell you, we\u2019re mid innings on there. As you might imagine, the contract cycle is longer there. So, we\u2019re working our way through that. So, that's where we expect to see the upside going into \u201819 and beyond. The first two phases were a little bit easier, if you will, to execute on, although the buckets weren\u2019t quite as big, which is making sure that our own internal customers -- commercial customers are giving us the material that we expect. And then, lastly, it is making sure that when material hits the floor that the contamination levels are not above what we can otherwise process. So, there is three buckets around that.\nI mentioned earlier, our OpEx from a MRF standpoint kind of peaked in Q2, which probably shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone because there is a obviously lot of volatility in the market at that point. And off the top of my head, we've probably come down about 4% to 5% in our operating cost per ton since then. But, if you look at Q3 and Q4, we kind of stabilized revenues, and we've continued to make improvements and the overall MRF performance at those cycling plants suggests that what we're doing around contamination is that -- it is driving a big piece of that improvement.\nJim Fish\nAnd Sean, I think the original number we gave in terms of tailwind was $40 million to $50 millionish, something like that. And that was -- we always qualified it by saying that assumes flat commodity prices from where they were. They have come down a bit. So, they\u2019ve softened a bit more, and that's why we\u2019re a bit hesitant to give a number. But, I think, suffice it to say, it's going to be somewhere of between -- it's going to be a tailwind, we just don\u2019t know exactly what it's going to be. If it flattens from here, I would say, we're going to stay where we are now. We haven't -- I don\u2019t know that we know the number, but I think it's probably in the 20 to $30 million range would be my guess. But, then, again, I'm not sure it flattens here. It may return back up to where it was a couple months ago. So, that's why we\u2019re a little uncertain about it. But, the number that we gave originally, assuming flat commodity pricing back at the end of the third quarter was 40 to $50 million. And if it does return to that, I think you will see us kind of in that range with the things that John mentioned, as well, continuing to work on kind of that phase 3 of contamination fees with the municipalities and then also an added focus on operating costs.\nJohn Morris\nSean, this is probably the toughest quarter to call just because this is generally a volatile market from a commodity standpoint with what\u2019s generally going on overseas."]], ["If I strip that out over the last three years, and I look at the sustainable growth between them, like \u201817 to \u201818 you are up 12%, but \u201818 to \u201819 you're up sort of mid 5s.

We definitely are happy that if you normalize \u201817 to \u201818 for taxes and interests and the proceeds from divestitures and do the same for \u201818 to \u201819, we're in about a 7% annual growth environment.\nJim Fish\nI think, Michael, one of the questions that you\u2019ve all had of us is how is this -- you're EBITDA, which is really the long pole in the tent, right? I mean, how is that converting to cash, how is it converting to free cash flow? And if we look at \u201817, \u201818, \u201819, \u201819 of course is our guide, so if we look at that we're pleased, very pleased with that. I mean \u201817 was 42.2; \u201818, if you strip out some of those one-time tax planning and normalize the divestiture, I mean we're always going to have some divestitures in there. So, I'm not saying take it out completely but more of a $100 million in divestitures than the big year that we had this year. If you normalize \u201818, 45.1 and then when you look at our guidance for \u201919, 46.3. So, somewhere between 90 basis points to 120 basis points of the annual growth in that conversion ratio. And by the way, remember, it was too long ago that we\u2019re -- that number started with a 3 and it was really the mid-3s.

We obviously had a strong 2018 and we still see health in those pipelines. I think, Jim and Devina both commented on the commercial line of business. And we -- service increases versus decreases is certainly a good barometer along with our other sales activity. And while we're kind of looking out at the horizon to make sure we're not missing something, the short-term outlook is still strong. In fact, as Devina mentioned, the service increase and decrease ratios actually improve as the year goes on. So, we have not seen softening in those buckets as of yet.\nDevina Rankin\nAnd we certainly take into consideration a lot of attention in our business is paid to housing starts and new business formation.

Of course, we've talked a lot about the fact that we think recycling is going to be a tailwind for us, and that tailwind could be kind of somewhere in the $40 million to $50 million range and that assumes commodity prices hold flat where they are today, I tend to think they're kind of closer to the bottom than they are to the top. So, if they show any improvement then that number could be better.\nBut the $40 million to $50 million basically is the carryover effect of these fees that we've put into place throughout the year. But more of those fees have been hitting us in Q3 and Q4 than in Q1 and Q2 last year. So, without saying where we think we're going to come in because we just haven't scrubbed all those numbers yet, it's why I said in my prepared remarks that I think EBITDA growth can at least at a baseline be as good as this year, which is 5% and there's a real possibility that we could exceed it in 2019."]], ["You're on track to deliver kind of 2% and 2% yield plus volume, or frankly well above that on volume this year.\nBut as you look at what you talked about with disposal pricing, getting better pricing to account for rising third-party costs. ", ["Hey, Noah. Let me jump in, and I know Jim will have something to add to this. But you heard it a lot, my previous boss talked a lot about 2% and 2%. We've done that now for six consecutive quarters. As that retiring employee of the company and a big shareholder, I really like the idea from my current boss talking about 3% and 3%. But 2% and 2% is good as well. So, not a forecast, that's a existing executive but a shareholder loving 3% and 3%.\nJames C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.\nWell, so here's what I would add to that. Look, I think we're going to finish the year around a yield number of maybe not for the whole year but certainly in Q3, Q4 of around 2.5%. And so, Devina talked about disposal pricing and getting more aggressive with that. We've talked about taking some cost pass-through, price increases for things like third-party transportation. So, Jim, I don't think it's unrealistic to expect that we couldn't finish 2019 for the entire year at a 3% yield. You did say 3% and 1%, and...\nJames E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.\nI didn't.\nJames C.

", ["Like Jim said, we'll definitely scrub some of the details, particularly on the capital side of the equation, as we get closer to providing guidance for 2019. I think the most important piece in the baseline free cash flow assumption comes down to EBITDA growth.\nAnd the long-term EBITDA growth rate that Jim mentioned of 5% and being confident in that, we're going to peg our expectations for long-term free cash flow growth at that level. And so, if we look at 2018 guidance of $1.95 billion to $2 billion, our expectation at this point would be that the EBITDA growth will translate into free cash flow growth."]], ["Given the commentary, humorous or not, about a 3% and 3%, let's temper it and just say it's still a 2% and 2%, but you don't have the headwind from recycling.

But just more of an indication of our view of the overall economy and our view of our business less specifically. I would tell you that I think that 2% and 2% is, assuming the economy stays strong, that 2% and 2% is probably conservative. I think we can do better than 2% and 2%.\nThere is a bear case out there for volumes within the industry. We are much closer to the bull case and it's not just kind of an aspiration. When we look at the bull case and we look at the impact of tax reform that is still being felt, we look at reduced government regulation beginning to positively impact the special waste market, we look at the construction business continuing to grow, cranes in just about every city and even housing starts, which I mentioned earlier. It doesn't have as big an impact on us, but housing starts potentially kind of bottoming, all of that is kind of a bullish case that would tell you that volumes have more upside than downside in this type of economy.\nAnd look, I don't want to be blindly optimistic here, but it sure feels like when I look at some of our advanced indicators that we're closer to the bull case than the bear case, which kind of leads me to believe that 2.5% is more doable than 2%."]], ["Just what surprised you the most about the results in the MSW business so far in the year to give you the confidence to kind of raise the EPS guidance despite the Recycling headwinds.

We have maybe if there was a surprise it's the fact that with this steeper downturn as we have seen in Recycling over a short period, that Solid Waste has been so strong that it's been able to completely eclipse that. And so, if there is a surprise, it's that.\nTo get a bit more specific about the individual pieces, certainly, the Landfill business has been good. I mentioned a bit of it there in my script and Jim as well. The volumes that we've seen have been up. I'm not sure I would call them a surprise, but they're certainly a welcome addition to several years ago where we weren't showing really any volume improvement. It's not been that long ago that every quarter we talked about strong core price and yield, but always had to answer questions about poor volumes. So the fact that these individual lines of business are showing a 3.2% in Commercial and 3.1% in roll-off, those are strong.\nIf maybe I had to pick one surprise, it's that Residential \u2013 Jim kind of stressed it, but it's that Residential is now actually positive.

", ["So you've got that part of it right. The one piece that I would correct is from a commodity price perspective, the pressure that we saw on a year-over-year comp basis was much heavier in the first half of 2017 and 2018 on a year-over-year basis than it will be in Q3 and Q4. So that's part of the reason that the incremental up to $0.05 from the current year-to-date impact of $0.15 that you noted at the high end is so much less than what we've already experienced in the year.\nAnd then, as Jim had mentioned, our efforts on both cost reduction and our particular interest on contamination fees with our customers, should provide lift over and above what we've already experienced given the delay in execution of some of those in the current year.\nWith regard to Solid Waste, I think that the big picture there is that if you only have $0.05 of impact in the back half of the year relative to the $0.15 of impact that we've had from the Recycling line of business and Solid Waste has more than overcome that $0.15 drag, that tells you that there's a lot of lift that will come from Solid Waste in the back half of the year. And then on top of that, we'll have some lift from the lower tax rate that we have provided."]], ["And does the acceleration of that in what you just alluded to, Devina, going to the second half is that you're expecting that to be on a first half versus second half basis to be even better. ", ["The one piece that I would remind you about though is Q1 was particularly strong because of the Fuel Tax Credit. So we have had some of the benefit in the first quarter. But Solid Waste, because we're talking about on an EPS basis, comparing the $0.15 that had to be overcome to a $0.05 detriment from the Recycling line of business. But on the EBITDA line at $1.061 billion, the level of growth that we've seen should provide us confidence to hit somewhere between the $4.2 billion and $4.25 billion of EBITDA growth, which would be full year growth of around 5% on a consolidated basis.\nJames C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.\nI think, Michael, what we're really saying is that as the Recycling headwind moderates in the back half of the year and Solid Waste stays as strong as it's been, then you really do see that that lift coming in the back half. I'm not sure whether I would say it's Solid Waste getting even better than it is. Solid Waste is as good as it's been in over a decade. It's just that the Recycling comps get easier in the back half."]], ["Talk about if you can things you're doing to try and reduce that number and the timing of it given these training efforts and focus on the labor retention and the like. ", ["Well, some of what we've talked about is automation in the fleet, particularly in the Residential line of business. That's been a big step forward for us and it continues to be something that we're focused on. In addition to that, I think it gets back to the onboard computers and the efficiency in our routing and fleet structure and optimization of that part of our business. And that's provided benefits for us, substantial benefits for us over the last several years.\nThe second quarter impacts that you saw really are volume and growth-related. And as we take up our routes, we've increased our route structure by almost 1%, which is impressive given over 3% volume expansion in both commercial and industrial Collection volumes. So the focus really from a labor perspective is ensuring that we flex as we see volume growth and we find ways to use automation and technology to improve the working environment. And that doesn't just impact direct labor costs, but it also impacts safety and risk management costs as well.\nJames E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.\nAnd, Michael, a couple of additional items just to add color. I completely agree with Devina on her points. But most of our efficiency gains over the last couple of years have come at the beginning at the end of our route structures using the new tools that we've rolled out. We started early this year with a project looking at the middle of the route. We rolled out some tools that allow a route manager, a district manager, to clearly see the efficiency, the timing versus a plan for every driver, and they see that real time. And we've just begun that effort that led us target some of the time opportunities in the middle of the route. And that'll help. It's a longer-term project. But just given the number of routes that we have on the street, but that'll help.\nThe bigger issue is that as we've talked about we had a later seasonality impact in Q2 than in previous years. A lot of our volume growth on the Collection side of the business came in that May and June period. And I love 3% commercial and industrial volume growth. I'm not sure, Michael, I remember that happening in a quarter at the same time where both of them did. So, we overwhelmed some of our larger-growth districts with a lot of volume, and therefore because we've talked about, Jim and I both mentioned it earlier, with new drivers, with new route structures, with new training, it's underway with a little bit of overtime to handle that structure. As we get our arms around that and manage that growth, you'll see margin expansion on that Collections line of business closer to where we expected in the second half of the year."]], ["Hey, Jim appreciate your comments on the recycling markets these days and sounds like you guys are taking a leadership position there as you should and trying to clean up the industry and change some of the habits, practices being employed just into the new environment all seems very logical.\nJust some questions around the impact in 1Q from because I noticed you said there was a $0.08 hit to EPS on I think it was about $77 million of sales. ", ["Yes, so the EBITDA impact was about $46 million for us for the quarter and that\u2019s driven by those things I mentioned in my prepared remarks. The big decline in OCC mix, paper down 85%, but what\u2019s maybe a little different from prior years is that we\u2019re seeing a big uptick in operating costs that\u2019s as a result of that 0.5% contamination limit that China has put on. And then in addition to that think of it this way, we were shipping about 30% of our cardboard a year ago to China and it\u2019s now about 2%.\nFortunately we have markets that we can ship to not everybody is that fortunate. But there\u2019s a higher transportation costs that comes with that, those markets are markets like India and Vietnam, and so the haul is longer to get to those countries versus China. So we\u2019ve seen an increase in our transportation cost as well.\nBut I think maybe more directly to your question as we think about what this looks like going forward. There is a bare case to be made here about recycle, as well as a whole case to be made about recycling and that is that not only are we going through those steps to improve the business in the short-term, but look China needs cardboard and there\u2019s probably 5% growth of cardboards in China expected for 2018 and they really have three sources of it, one is OCC, imported OCC which I mentioned we\u2019re -- really we\u2019re not sending ours and most are not either. So they\u2019re not getting OCC from the import market.\nThe domestic Chinese OCC market is drastically insufficient to satisfy their demand so they\u2019ve resorted to pulp, which is just spite as a result of the artificial shortfall in supply without OCC. So I think there\u2019s a case to be made that theirs is ball case to be made here. And I think the other side of that is that we\u2019re looking for the medium and long-term at changing some of our technology and our plans, so that we can better handle contamination coming in the front door. I don\u2019t know whether that answers your question, but that\u2019s kind of the bull on bear case for us.\nJames Trevathan\nJim maybe for Brian benefit mentioned too that alliance with your bull case right now that $0.12 to $0.15 revised guidance is based on about $80 a ton for our commodities. We\u2019re now at about $70, $72, $73 in that vicinity. So it\u2019s not a huge upside that\u2019s built into that guidance on the commodity side we have some upside expected, but we truly see that because of Jim\u2019s bull case we not fully expect that to happen.\nIn addition if you just look at the commodity trends right now domestic OCC and we see it trending up from that April level that we saw that\u2019s exceptionally low as Jim pointed out. The export OCC we also see that trend up for the Jim\u2019s bull case example, export OMP, we see moving up from the April level significantly and that\u2019s in our guidance number.\nAnd really down one is that mix paper that we\u2019ll see moving forward as we move forward. But the point is that in that new revised guidance we got about $10 of commodity price that we build in on the upside into that guidance.\nJames Fish\nBut I think the wrench in the mask there really is the operating cost that\u2019s what\u2019s -- that\u2019s kind of the short answer, we gave a long answer to your short question, but that is if you're just looking at kind of commodity prices, you should be able to kind of do the math that you were doing. The wrench is operating cost and then that\u2019s something we haven't necessarily seen and seen a big spike is what's caused the difference."]], ["And then just sort of to Jim's point on what's baked into the guidance, it looks like an incremental $0.04 to $0.07 hit for the rest of the year after the $0.08 this quarter. ", ["So Brian, I would start by saying with regard to the guidance that we've always provided with respect to that $0.04 impact for the $10 shift in prices. What's important there is to reiterate Jim's point is that is the commodity price piece only. And so that speaks to revenue sensitivity. The operating expense sensitivity is the other piece of the equation. So we wouldn't break with that guidance, because they're not necessarily connected.\nSo what we did see in the first quarter is that in addition to the EPS impact, which were about 75% to 80% of the $0.08 of negative impact that we saw in the quarter from commodity price changes, we also saw that OpEx be about 20% to 25% of an impact.\nWith respect to the last part of your question, I think what's important to remember is first quarter was really the strongest quarter for recycling in the prior year. And the comps and the decline in commodity prices we really started to see in the fall of 2017. And so the more positive outlook for the remainder of the year relative to what we saw in the first quarter really has to do with the impacts of those year-over-year comps, and then to some extent starting to see some benefits of the specific action that the company is taking.\nJames Trevathan\nYes Brian, we also on the operating costs side we expect that it's built into that guidance. We expect to see operating costs improvement versus the first quarter. We've got some strong actions underway. We look by Murf [ph] at where their commodities are being shipped. And then address the contamination cleanup level to the end marketplace.\nAnd perhaps in the first quarter we weren't as good at that as we implemented that Chinese the new standard. And you'll see operating costs on the recycle side get better that will help us meet that new guidance number versus the trend for Q1.\nJames Fish\nI know we're spending a lot of time on this question here, but this is really the -- it's the major detractor everything else was really, really strong in this quarter. And yet when you look at recycling, we knew there were going to be some questions on it. And we can go into the strength of solid waste, we talked a bit about it in our scripts.\nBut Brian, last thing I would say is about second quarter and then guidance for the remainder of the year is when you see China do these -- kind of take these types of steps, they always do it in the first quarter. Because that is -- that's the quarter where they can afford to see OCC drop from 30% to 2% from Waste Management or from anybody else for that matter.\nBut they do have a need as I said for cardboard and it's 5% there really is -- their options are pretty limited. I gave three and really that second option is not much of an option domestic OCC. So it's going to have to be imported OCC or pulp and pulp has doubled. So at some point they have to come back to import OCC, which is why we think the price as Jim said has some upside, much more upside potential than down side."]], ["The first question is just around more work you plan to do with your cash, leverage is at an all-time low, free cash flow is at all-time high, does it probably antitrust issues in growing in the core business. ", ["So Hamzah I would say the first quarter is a really good indicator of our confident in the free cash flow generation and the balance sheet strength that you mentioned. And as I mentioned we allocated more than 100% of free cash flow through a combination of share buyback and the dividend and then on top of that acquired $248 million of solid waste businesses.\nAnd so I think that\u2019s a really good indication of how we think about capital allocation going forward. We\u2019re continuing to commit to growing the dividend over the long-term as we did this year with a 9.4% increase on a year-over-year basis. And then we\u2019re looking at $750 million baseline of share buyback for the year, so committed to that strong allocation, as we have always been.\nJames Fish\nHamzah those $248 million of acquisitions that Devina mentioned it\u2019s seven or eight transaction in Q1 of excellent tuck-ins that are in really good markets for us, where we\u2019re asset strong and can internalize and get some synergies out of that material. So we\u2019re excited about that revenue that was added.\nEarly pipeline for 2018 is strong as well, and we\u2019ll still look for really good acquisitions at a fair price, they are accretive to our business and expect to do more of them in 2018."]], ["And then just second question, I know you gave a lot of detail on recycling, but my question is a little more specific around recycling is, overtime you have restructured some contracts, you have tried to derisk that business.

Contamination is the route of this, it is -- and it goes back to that statement I made earlier, which is we\u2019ve kind gone away from recycling to diversion.

The numbers that I gave are actual numbers, five years ago we\u2019re in the 10% to 15% contamination range at our single streams, and now we are 20% to 25% and that I think is what caused China to ultimately say we\u2019re tired of importing your trash, so get your act together.\nSo it may not be a message that\u2019s necessarily pleasing to hear for our customers, but it\u2019s not our trash that we\u2019re creating.

It's not up to where it was in 2006 at 2.1 or a big number like that. But it's been a nice consistent upward trend.\nAnd so hence we're seeing that sharpen our C&D business and I might kind of answer a question for you in advance here, but because we've spend so much time on recycling, let me just give you Michael and everyone a number here that that is really eye opening about the strength of the solid waste business and that is our EBITDA growth.\nWhen you think about EBITDA, and we showed a number of $69 million in growth in EBITDA for the quarter, but what's included in that is the bonus, which the $2 bonus, which was $18 million we already talked about the $46 million headwind in recycling. And then the fuel tax credit, which was $28 million positive for us.\nIf you said let\u2019s adjust for those and just see what the solid waste business is doing, the traditional solid waste adjusting those three things out, you get $105 million in growth, which is 11.9%, almost 12% almost all organic growth in an EBITDA line and a 2.5% economy.

So it\u2019ll be positive, but it isn\u2019t going to be a 28% in my estimation, I\u2019d love for that to happen.\nThe other point to mention is that C&D is about 10% of our total landfill volume. So although very positive the rest of the lines of business in landfill were really strong as well."]], ["Maybe you guys won\u2019t agree with me maybe I am being a bit too colorful, but am I crazy to think that this maybe the best thing that ever happened to recycling?

But I do think you are right, it is something that needs to change, when we all think about recycling, recycling is a good thing, but unfortunately it has shifted away from this recycling for the saving of the world\u2019s natural resources to diversion, which just means how much less can I put in my trash bin and how much more can I put in my recycle bin. And I think that has kind of a bad unintended consequence.\nJames Trevathan\nTyler, I think somebody pointed aspirational recycling versus the real recycling that I think we all is right and our customers get it. They fully -- they understand it, some of them don\u2019t like it, but they truly understand it. And I think you\u2019ll see overtime, we will make this business better in the long run.\nJames Fish\nMaybe one last example here Tyler is, kind of a funny example, but maybe the -- maybe where the misunderstanding is, is that look a lawn mower has a lot of recycle material on it, it doesn\u2019t mean that you can put it in your recycle bin and send it to our single stream, because we don\u2019t have the equipment to breakdown the lawn mower, I mean yes the blades made out of steel, but we -- our single stream equipment cannot process a lawn mower or a baby stroller or name any other item like that.\nAnd so there is -- I think there is a misunderstanding about what our recycle facilities will actually process, they obviously do the good job of processing tin cans, and aluminum cans and plastic bottles and cardboard and papers, but they can\u2019t take the rubber out of a hose and they can\u2019t take the metal out of a lawn mower."]], ["So in this quarter resi volumes still down though improving and really getting the growth, more growth both on price and volumes is in the C&I the higher margin part of the business.

", ["I\u2019ll take the second question, I\u2019ll let Jim address the broker question, but yes, I mean, ultimately what happens and that\u2019s the irony of all this is that when this material comes in the front door if you have a plan where the inbound stream is 40% contaminated materials, today we sent a piece of it out as commodities, but that 40% as much of that as we can pull out ultimately ends up in a landfill and that is the irony of diversion.\nIs that while it may get diverted at the first step, which is at the curb, it doesn\u2019t get diverted overall that\u2019s why we believe that recycling should be the goal not diversion because diversion ultimately just means that it ends up getting processed through our plant, but still ends up going to a landfill. So there\u2019s really no economic gain in pushing that through a plant.\nBut Jim the broker question.\nJames Trevathan\nYes, and maybe just to comment too for Michael on that last point and that\u2019s why we are working with our customers, our largest residential customers in cities and communities around education that is -- that can be a true mitigator of that factor is to not contaminate if you will some of the recyclables, but we\u2019re not going to wait for that to happen. We\u2019re going to execute as the contracts allow and as third parties bring us material contamination charges that are allowable and reject materials that can\u2019t be recycled because it can\u2019t be sold.\nOn the brokerage business it really are they are large volume customers that we end up just marketing their product for them. So we have a very low margin, low mid-single-digit kind of margin, but no capital involved, there are no trucks involved, we\u2019re not collecting the material. We\u2019re just helping them broker their material and combining it with our excellent team that has the outlets all over the world.\nSo it\u2019s again low margin, but really valuable for us and aligns us better with our customers as well."]], ["Yes, I would agree with that, I mean, I am just -- I guess I am curious, could you guys just remind us like what has changed to be able to get this type of margin performance, is it just better cost control, is it removing costs during a low CPI environment.

So SG&A has -- and that SG&A percentage as Devina said in her prepared remarks has come down. So SG&A, operating costs controls with SDO which we\u2019ve talked about for years.\nAnd then when your top-line growth is coming in C&I and landfill that\u2019s going to be good for your margins. So we think we\u2019re doing some things with the customer in terms of customer -- improving customer experience, we\u2019re very, very focused on a best-in-class customer experience. And we think that is showing up in our growth numbers in the commercial and industrial lines of business.\nJames Trevathan\nMichael Jim called it in his early statements of disciplined growth and our term for that what that includes is that point of where we grow and at what price we grow our business. We are very careful to make sure we\u2019re not just adding volume, we are adding it in the right places that add that margin expansion and with where we can internalize that volume. So it\u2019s not just the economic growth, it\u2019s the discipline of grow at the price with the right customer base that adds to that margin expansion."]], ["I mean, in my 30 years of covering this, there was a time where a garbage company would add a truck at 45 hours' worth of utilization and hope it grew into 50 hours' worth of utilization.

We've got 98% of our districts that are up about 98% of our routes are certified. So, we're really pushing to continue to get that efficiency.

So, they're not buying a lot of cardboard at this point. So, this is the right time of year for them to do it, not coincidence that they did this with a Green Fence a few years ago during the same time a year. And how that's kind of plays out for us is that we're seeing because of the lower demand you're seeing prices drop off.\nSo, we've seen, I think Jim, a 24% decrease in price in the fourth quarter and we're projecting something in that neighborhood maybe even a little more in Q1. And then starting to normalize in terms of commodity prices in Q2, but particularly in Q3 and Q4. And then the other side is, is cost, and because of these contamination limits of 0.5%, we are seeing our processing cost to go up. And so we're \u2013 that's something that we have some control over and we're in the process of addressing that going forward.\nJames E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.\nHey, Michael, to your first part, yeah, we have outlets for our materials. We talked about it quite a bit on the last couple of calls. We've spend a lot of time, our team at corporate, we think, are the best in the industry at finding outlets for materials. And we've done that aggressively. It doesn't affect cost, cost is still down, but we absolutely have outlets for our materials. But Jim mentioned contamination, I also want to mention, we're looking to reclaim part of that contamination cost over time. We did a lot of work as we've talked about the last three or four years, around the business model itself. And contracts are part of that and we've gotten real value, this is still a really valuable business to our shareholder, but to our customers.\nAnd we've gotten value out of those contract changes that got rid of floor pricing. Most of them added contamination charges, we \u2013 for third-party volumes, we're charging contamination charges and it started to get more aggressive in that regard. For the public sector contracts, most of them have the clauses in place, but getting it from those residential customers is a little different task. And we're aggressively ramping-up that effort as well, to try to reclaim that cost. And again, improve the business model itself, so that long-term, these kinds of changes are managed properly.\nBut without a doubt, we're getting rid of our materials, have no issues there, but it is affecting price and cost because of the transportation.\nJames C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.\nI don't think it's overstating it, Michael, to say we're going to go to battle against contamination here. And I think that's better for us economically. It's also better for the environment. So, it's the right thing to do on all fronts, but we are definitely going to go to battle against contamination."]], ["Can you just talk a little bit?\nI'm looking for more about how you're thinking about this, not like a definitive answer, but it's kind of philosophy, why did you decide a one-time bonus was kind of the right thing to do? ", ["Yeah, Corey. I mean, look, there were a couple of objectives and we've talked about them on the call and in other forms. But beyond just injecting dollars into the economy and giving something, as Devina mentioned, to those employees that don't participate in the salary and incentive plans, we've talked a lot today about the fact that we \u2013 that part of the objective was to encourage our folks to make careers at Waste Management.\nKeep in mind, this is somewhat of kind of uncharted water for us, because we haven't \u2013 I would argue that nobody on the call or at this table has been through something where we've seen a big tax reduction like this and how that is best returned to shareholders. I mean, is it best returned to shareholders just through a straight share repurchase, or is it best returned to shareholders through injecting it back to the economy and then seeing that growth?\nAnd so, as we've thought about what to do with some of those dollars as it relates to our employees, we felt we don't really know the answer. And so, a piece of that objective was to buy ourselves a little bit of time, hence the payout at the end of the year and help us by doing that in designing programs for the future, potentially that help us with retention. So, I don't know whether that answers your question, but that was really our thinking."]], ["And then on the volume front, maybe this is another slightly hard question to answer but, Jim Fish, in the past you've talked about focusing somewhat, I think, disproportionately on opportunities for growth in parts of either the economy or the country that are growing as opposed to looking for volume kind of everywhere. ", ["I think, the good news here, Corey, is \u2013 and you're right that's how we used to talk about it was that, hey, it looks pretty good in Texas but the rest of the country doesn't look very good. It looks good in Florida but not so good in the Northeast. I would tell you right now as we go through our monthly financial reviews and talk to our area vice presidents, boy, it's hard to find an area that doesn't have some strength. Now, there are some areas that are stronger than others. California for example is absolutely fantastic for us right now as is Florida. Texas has been, excluding the hurricane cleanup, has been a little slower because of the energy business but that's starting to come back.\nBut even places that historically have been slow for three decades that's kind of rust belt area, have started to show some real promise in terms of growth: Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania. New England's been good for us as well.\nSo, I've named just about every area for us. Canada is doing well for us as well. Western Canada is a little bit more like Texas because it's more energy-driven. But I would expect that Western Canada will start to pick up just like Texas is. So, hard to come up with one that's not doing pretty well right now."]], ["So I mean, just picking a little bit more precisely about the cadence of volume for 2018, that 2%, I mean, should it be a little bit lower in the first half of the year and gathering strength maybe in the third quarter?

And so, that's what you saw impact 2017, particularly in the commercial line of business. So, we don't have that same, kind of, large contracts that we'll be anniversarying in the year ahead. So, other than what Jim mentioned with regard to the landfill volumes and the storm debris, there's not anything that would dramatically influence the quarter-by-quarter volume trends in 2018.\nJames C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.\nI will say, Noah, what is encouraging to us, as we look into 2018, is that we're through the month of January, obviously, and when we look at January's volume, with slow volume on recycling, we still had a very good month. So, we're encouraged with what we saw in the month of January; it's a small sample, it's 1 out of 12, but January looked encouraging."]], ["And then I think, just thinking about price/volume mix, for many years, I think at least going back five years' average yields on collection and disposal was always higher than volume.

Those processes are in place and we're pretty good at it at the area level with corporate leading the way. The volume change, the economy has helped some, obviously. We think we've gotten better. We know we have on the defection side. We've gotten some again, the storm debris kind of things that helped that volume to price relationship, improve the volume side of the house. The outage that we've talked about in Virginia did; special waste was strong last year especially in the second half of the year and should move forward.\nBut most of that has come from economic change from our focus on defection and from our attempt to go put the right resources in the right cities and MSAs to take advantage of the volume that's occurring per GDP. That's what Jim talked about. So, as the opportunity is there, we've gotten better at getting that volume.\nJames C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.\nOne question, Noah, that hasn't been asked which has direct bearing on your question is CPI. I mean, we typically don't talk about CPI because for the last few years, it's worked against us and we've just said we'll get our price numbers irrespective of what CPI does. But CPI does impact about \u2013 and we have kind of indexed base pricing on about 35% of our total business. And we've always said that about a 10 basis point increase in CPI equates to a $0.01 per share. We've built in some increase, call it, 20 basis points into our pricing for 2018.\nBut we all saw the CPI numbers that came out yesterday, that we're higher than most people expected. So, there could be some upside there, albeit kind of on a half-year basis because we've already taken, we tend to take our index-type price increases in January and July with a few of them lingering into October.\nBut on a full year basis, once we get a full year of the CPI, I would expect that there will be some tailwind for us from CPI, but we won't get the full tailwind in 2018."]], ["And are you seeing any competition in getting the new contracts?\nAnd then, just trying to understand how much of this kind of seems like above market pricing growth that you're able to achieve over the next few years?

It has been and will be. Volume obviously helps in that from \u2013 it comes from the economy. There are more start-ups that give all of us a better opportunity to get some volume growth, but our core price strategy isn't going to change for our core collection customers.\nWe're still \u2013 the marketplace allows it, we go get that core price increase and we will in 2018. And I think the teams are set up and ready to do again in 2019 and 2020 and on. I just don't see that changing, and I don't see a competitive difference today than two or five years ago."]], ["And then just maybe shifting gears to recycling, if I heard correctly I think you said is you're expecting about a $0.04 decline year-over-year in recycling earnings in 2018, kind of heavily weighted to the first half of the year. ", ["I think it's all of the above. The way we came up with the $0.04 is that we looked at September pricing. September OCC pricing \u2013 and OCC is the commodity that's been most impacted by this, and so September OCC pricing, export pricing was down about 24% from the peaks in July. So we took a look at it and said, another 5% decline from there puts us at about export OCC pricing, about the same export OCC pricing that we saw in Q4 of 2016, which felt reasonable to us and that's the number we used to build up to a $0.04 decline in recycle earnings for 2018.\nJames E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.\nDerrick, I might add to this, to that specific answer, that we're seeing orders now. China has granted a few licenses and we're preparing shipments here in Q4 to their mills. Their mills need the product. We all know there's a growing need for more product based on e-commerce activity. There are more and more products being delivered to my front door every day and probably yours as well. So, we see that activity happening at pricing above that low point here in Q4. Not at the same rate that we saw in the summer or in the spring, but it's starting to happen. Derrick, they've been in our plants for a few years now, their inspectors looking at the material, making sure the quality is right and they're now not only inspecting, but they're granting approval for shipments that meet their requirements, so we're seeing that activity.\nAnd then, I guess lastly, and as you mentioned in your question, we have developed for four years or five years now, other markets around Southeast Asia primarily and in India to receive materials. Our large brokerage business requires us to find alternative markets and we've done that and that's helping us as well as we look for ways to get around the short term blip we think in what China's doing. Granted, I don't mean to imply that what they're doing truly is short term. They're looking we think at the long term. But they need material and we're shipping to them, but we're also finding alternatives, so we \u2013 I think that bodes well for the numbers that Jim gave you.\nJames C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.\nWell, I think, Derrick, I think Jim's color there reinforces why we don't feel that the October lows are the right baseline to use, that we're already starting to see, as Jim said, some promising signs coming into November."]], ["And then on the free cash flow, Jim Fish, if this was July and you had to do it all over again, would you have actually raised your guidance then given what you knew? ", ["Look, it's not that we didn't see this coming, but we felt like in July, look, we're halfway through the year, let's \u2013 I think every time we've ever raised guidance in the past, we've waited until the third quarter to do it, because things can happen throughout the year that \u2013 and what you don't want to do is raise your guidance and then find out that you didn't anticipate something or something happened that's caused the other direction.\nSo I mean, I would answer your question by saying two things. One is, we knew we were having a good year when we were on our second quarter earnings call, but in the interest of being reasonably conservative, we wanted to wait until third quarter to really kind of reaffirm that, and that's why we're raising guidance in Q3.\nDevina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.\nAnd I would add to that, Michael, that some of the strength that we've seen in 2017 that we didn't anticipate is related to working capital changes and some traction that we've seen in the procure to pay initiatives and as you know, working capital improvements are really difficult to predict and we're still working through the processes there.\nAnd so, rather than over predict what we expected over the remainder of the year, we wanted to be sure that the traction we had seen in the first six months was going to continue, particularly because we had a couple of working capital headwinds that we've discussed with the swap termination and higher incentive compensation plans. The remainder of the cash flow drivers, particularly EBITDA growth, has come in line with our expectations and are outperforming in a way that's consistent with the earnings growth that we're reflecting in our updated guidance.\nJames C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.\nYeah, I think, Michael, just to tag on to Devina's comments. Really, the two things that have \u2013 this is a story about EBITDA and working capital when it comes to cash from operations. And it's \u2013 Devina mentioned, the reasons behind working capital and the procure to pay program, or technology we put into place, but also really strong landfill volumes, really strong volumes across the board, and those landfill volumes and our overall volumes continue as we look at the month of October."]], ["The $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion brilliant, but can you grow it in 2018 or am I in a pause because all of the things you just described and then another lift in 2019?

We feel good about the volumes that we're seeing and the kind of 7% to 8% growth that we're seeing in EBITDA. As Devina mentioned, CapEx is a bit of a \u2013 I wouldn't say a wildcard because that implies that we don't control it, we do. But we may or may not be in that 9% to 10% range in 2018. She talked a bit about why. One thing she did mention was investing more heavily in our CNG fleet, because we're seeing a very nice payback for a CNG truck versus a diesel truck in terms of not only the cost of fuel, but also maintenance cost. So I think, we feel good about the long-term growth prospects of the business and we'll talk more about where we think free cash will be for 2018, when we get to the beginning of the quarter next year."]], ["From talking to people in the industry, it's not only the limitation of certain streams of waste that they're accepting, but they're also pushing more quality initiatives to try to reduce the contaminant percentage. ", ["Jeff, I mentioned that earlier as well, but a little more color to it. We've been looking at reducing contamination for years. It's part of our recycling strategy, when we started two or three years ago talking about improving that business model itself. So we're already ahead of that game. We've got excellent people. We've got really good assets. We have invested in those plants to be able to sort material better and properly. We've got a really good accountability process in place. I mentioned that we've got some of the Chinese inspectors that have been visiting our facilities for a number of years that now look at each prepared shipment and grant approval. So we're meeting their current expectations for that material now.\nAt the same time, I don't tell you that's not a long-term focus for us, it's even going to be stronger focus to make sure that we meet those requirements. We think we generate the best material in the marketplace. It's the same thing for service. We believe we're \u2013 that's our goal is world class service, but it's also world class product. We think the companies, the facilities that generate the best material will win in the long run and we're doing that. And I don't want to miss the statement though that we're looking for alternative markets and we've developed them for years to help that brokerage business. It's a real risk aversion support for our recycling business overall when we've done that and we'll do more of that in Southeast Asia and in India, where we ship material in the fourth quarter when China granted no licenses for a period of time. So you're right to focus on it, but we are as well."]], ["Can you give us some kind of quantification what you've been paying, how that's been going up and if you think that'll continue to be a pressure on your operating expenses going forward? ", ["Yeah, Jeff, it has been a pressure, but I'll tell you, we look at it also as an opportunity. We've gone at it from a district by district standpoint. We look with our HR team at where are we versus the marketplace by MSA on payment for drivers and for technicians and we adjust accordingly. We've been doing that for a year or two year now. We're going to strengthen that focus to make sure that we're competitive in the marketplace while we look for opportunities to differentiate why a driver ought to work for us versus another trucking operation. So it has been a pressure, but we've overcome that with efficiencies and other opportunities, so you don't see it dramatically on our P&L statement.\nJames C. Fish, Jr. - Waste Management, Inc.\nI would tell you, Jeff, that while wage inflation is certainly a consideration for us, maybe an even bigger consideration is tackling turnover and making sure that we are doing everything we can to limit the amount of turnover that we have. It's a fact of life for us but to the extent that we can limit it, is a huge, huge value for us. There is a significant cost to every employee, be that a driver or a technician or an accountant when we turn them over and the training cost and kind of the ramp up are all costly to us. So we have put a real focus on reducing turnover."]], ["I mean what kind of \u2013 in a normal quarter, what kind of operating margin leverage would you normally expect on that kind of volume growth and maybe kind of an outlook for margins for the full year. ", ["Sure, Brian. I would actually say we felt good about our margins for the quarter, and here's why. The EBITDA margins were up 10 basis points, or better by 10 basis points, but they were impacted by two factors. You mentioned the one, which was fuel tax credits. That was worth about 20 basis points to us in margin. But the other one that Jim's going to give a little bit of color on is our recycling brokerage business. And that recycling brokerage business was up over 5% in revenue, which impacted margins by 50 basis points. And so, if you exclude those two, you're talking about 70 basis points of margin accretion there. So, that's why I would say we felt good about our margins even being better by only 10 basis points on the EBITDA line.\nJames E. Trevathan - Waste Management, Inc.\nYeah, Jim. Maybe just a couple of facts, first about the recycling business and then into that brokerage side. Overall pricing was up about 31%, volume was up 4%, as we said, and that lower margin brokerage business revenue grew about 10%. It is lower margin. It's 4% to 6% margin on that brokerage business, but it's still extremely healthy for us and good for us strategically.\nJust a little bit of comparison. First, the revenue is getting to be a substantial percentage of our revenue. It's significant. In fact, the brokerage business is about 2 times larger than our largest competitor's total recycling revenue. And they've got a very healthy business.\nThis brokerage business is about 50% of our total recycling revenue, but just as important as that are the benefits of that business for us. With those additional tonnages, we're able to command a little higher price per ton when we sell all of the volume, both our [MRF]-generated tons and this brokerage volume. It provides our customers that use this recycled commodity with a really consistent and high-quality volume, and it lets us get, we think, a couple extra dollars per ton.\nThe second thing about that brokerage business is it allows us to service these very large customers that generate this volume on a full-service basis, rather than just hauling their trash, we add some stickiness to what we do for them. And I guess the last thing I'd remind you is that these generators of this large volume in broker, they've got their own capital equipment, their balers, and they manage that volume, and we just help them sell it. So there's no capital investment to this line of business, Brian. And it helps us with what Devina said, the highest ROI in the industry. It aligns perfectly with that. And this business is almost an infinite ROI, given no capital associated with it.\nSo, if I'd summarize, Jim's right, we see that 70 basis points improvement without this and that fuel tax issue. This is a really healthy business for us. If you look at one last factor maybe that we were looking at recently, if you remove that brokerage business, our overall WM Waste Management's EBITDA margin would be about 120 basis points higher, would be about 29.2% in the second quarter, again, without that brokerage business, yet, we're going to stay in that business. It's the right thing to do for our customers and very strategic for us, and it's just good business.\nDevina A. Rankin - Waste Management, Inc.\nSo, to follow-on with the 50 to 100 basis point margin improvement that you referenced, when we think about that, it really was going to come from two places, and we're seeing both execution in both of those things in the first half of the year. And we expect that to continue.\nAnd the two places that was going to come from, and we're seeing results, are core solid waste business improvement to operating expense margin; and then secondarily, SG&A cost control driving margin improvement there. So, what Jim and Jim just described was a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin for our core solid waste operations, and then we saw a 30 basis point improvement in our SG&A cost in the quarter. So, those two things together get us to the top end of that 50 to 100 basis point range."]], ["And then, just given what you guys said about your M&A probably hitting the higher end of that $200 million spend, that would imply that you're just looking at some smaller type tuck-ins. ", ["I mean, there are obviously a few of those than the tuck-ins. And once you get to larger deals, then we, because of our size, have to consider HSR filings and things like that. So, it's not to say that there aren't deals out there of larger size. They involve more efforts for us from a justice perspective. Doesn't mean they're not good. We've done three of them over the last four years. But for now, we're focused on those tuck-ins. And then, as those other opportunities present themselves, I think that's really Devina's point is that the balance sheet gives us the ability to do those. The $100 million to $200 million just comes out of free cash flow, but if you start thinking about bigger deals, you have a balance sheet that's able to easily absorb bigger deals."]], ["I wonder how do you think about the potential impact on the recycling business as a whole, maybe, in particular, the brokerage part of the business, because it does seem like what's going to be restricted, in particular, a certain categories of plastics. ", ["Yeah. Noah, great question. Good timing for it. But remember that our brokerage business is almost entirely fiber and not plastics-related. So, we see no impact from a plastics standpoint on the brokerage business with China's action. It's really going to be a fiber and then some plastics, but, again, not brokerage-related. It's because of the way we sort the mixed paper and we do it today. We sort every bit of the mixed paper we receive. We don't see a material impact to what we export on that side. And that's one of their real focus is. The other are plastics that are out of the norm. It's not a large part of what we export.\nSo, we, as of now, don't see a significant impact to either part of that business, but that's still to be determined. It looks like China is really trying to help, from an environmental standpoint. It's not just related to recycle tools, but they're looking to help their internal businesses, probably perhaps to reduce or to manage price a little bit, but also to clean up some of the imported materials that they receive. Given what we do and what we see today, we just don't see a significant impact.

We're in the process of consolidating data. We're in the process of looking where we have data overlap and making sure that we establish data consistency and eliminating some of our applications where we have multiple applications that sometimes do the same thing.\nSo, we're not necessarily looking in this new Chief Technology Officer for a more traditional Chief Information Officer.

It just was masked a little bit by \u2013 in particular, by these two items that Jim talked about, which was the brokerage side of our business and the loss of the tax credit.\nIt's, Michael, why I went through that brokerage business and the recycling business overall is to clearly show not just its impact on margin and how great, I think, the core business is operating, but it's also to show us all that there's value in that recycling and commodity \u2013 or brokerage side of that business to the overall network."]], ["On the technology side, when you think about dynamic routing and you look at it today, what do you think the potential to either measures, things like number of miles driven, how much could be reduced or total hours \u2013 operating hours of the trucks reduced because of the success of what a dynamic routing system could do.

Last year it was 41%, so we're roughly in the same place as a percentage of the revenue. And you're right, the margin is at mid-single-digit margins, but as you stated it's very \u2013 there's no capital expense involved, so the ROI is really high and it really gives us leverage in the sale of commodities in addition to just providing more value to our customers, more stickiness with customers that have both large commodity volumes and other waste service needs. So we're very pleased with that business but it's relatively flat with prior year on a volume basis."]], ["And I think one of the theories for why it spiked so much over the last couple of months was maybe just a shift in trends from retail, brick-and-mortar to e-commerce and changes that might have on collection patterns. ", ["Yeah. I mean, the volumes have been \u2013 I think we're up 1% in volumes for the quarter. Definitely over the long-term, it's going to move or the shift that we're seeing in retail is going to affect volumes. It's hard to see it on a quarter-to-quarter basis though. And when we look at pricing of commodities, the volatility is greatest where the Chinese have the greatest impact. So for us, for example, virtually all of our newsprints goes to China and so when the Chinese decide they're not going to buy newsprints as they did a couple of weeks back, it really dramatically impacts the price of ONP, hence the drop of 40%. We end up selling about maybe 30% of our OCC to China, so while they still have a big and material impact on price that one was only off about 10% a couple of weeks ago. So, really, the pricing is probably driven as much by what the Chinese do and then the volume is much more of a longer-term trend. Somehow to your point, it will be a result of the shift in the retail business."]], ["I wanted to come back to recycling and the energy piece but I think Jim Trevathan has talked a little earlier about the strategic process or changes you guys have made.

For those years like we had, what, it in 2011 and 2012 when commodity prices dramatically went down and we weren't charging for processing to cover our cost, and now we do, we absolutely price all of our contracts to cover the processing cost plus an accretive margin to the company with a really healthy ROI, extremely healthy ROI in fact.

", ["Sure, thanks for the question, Vijay. As you know we had a really variable set of market conditions throughout 2019 and certainly the business mix we have was particularly impacted in part by some of the geographic considerations in China, the large mix we have in LC small molecule pharma and some of the industrial categories. As we turn the page to 2020, our starting point is really just a carry-over of market conditions from 2019.\nWe're not assuming an acceleration until we see clear change in the market. Within each geography and category we're looking to balance both the opportunities and the risks. With regard to pharma, as you point out, our assumptions include continued robust performance in the large molecule pharma market, which is about 30% of our mix overall and continued softness in the small molecule market, which is 70% of our mix, and that's why we have a - kind of a moderate view of the pharma market at this point.\nFrom an industrial standpoint, the biggest impacts we saw and you referenced TA, were in large polymer and chemicals companies. If you look at our top 20 account say within TA, those are the big global industrial polymers and chemicals companies, they were really soft through the year and particularly in the fourth quarter. Interestingly enough in TA we actually added more new accounts last year than we ever have to try to make up for that, but when the very large companies are down, it's challenging to overcome that.\nAnd I would also say that we do support those same customers through our Waters branded products as well and we saw the same exact phenomenon on the Waters side, as we saw in TA in that industrial polymers and chemicals.\nSo again, our assumption there is, we're not assuming a major rebound, but we are assuming stable conditions. And so, until we see some different conditions where we thought it was prudent to just assume a continuation of some of the conditions we saw in 2019 into the early part of '20 and we will update as we go along."]], ["I'm just curious, is this a continuation of the gross margin dynamic that we saw in '19 or is the step-up and maybe some of the commercial activities to support the new product launches and why would tax rate step up? ", ["Yes. So you've got a couple of questions buried in there Vijay, so I'll try to cover them all. We look at our gross margins and really our operating margins. The lower gross margin guidance, I'd say overall is really a function of our topline growth. Peeling that back down a little bit, we think about our gross margin. The two biggest levers on our gross margin are volume leverage and FX. And in years when we've had higher gross margins in the 59% range, we had mid single-digit plus growth. So I'd say the gross margin is really a function of our top line guide.\nAnd similarly with our operating margin and our operating expenses coming into 2020, we're really trying to strike a balance between growth, investment and profitability. And so we're continuing to invest in R&D and commercial capabilities. But we also have some headwind coming into 2020 with normalization of our variable costs and some expenses for Andrew Alliance. So that's our inputs for our guide of 30% operating margin.\nMoving on to the tax rate that you asked about, we ended the fourth quarter tax rate more favorable than we were expecting. That was due to some discrete items in the quarter as well as the mix of our profits in our tax jurisdictions, and we're not expecting that to repeat in 2020. So after we came out of tax reform, we're really looking at our tax rate for the business to be in that range of 14% to 15%."]], ["I know you talked about pill count, generic and population growth, which sounds great, but that's really hard for us to distill that back to the model, particularly as - there's all this excitement over burgeoning our biologic pipelines? ", ["Sure. Yes, thanks, Danny. I think as we look at the overall market, we've seen consistent feedback from a lot of different sources that the small molecule market has been in a tougher growth environment recently. And what's most different about Waters is that, we have such a large exposure there, with pharma being about 55% of our revenue overall, and small molecule being 70% of that. We're simply more exposed.\nAs you know, we have a unique mix that's in our LC business, that's pharma heavy and is QC heavy. And so where we play and what we see, we see our share is very stable. We're expecting to the majority of workflows and within our installed base the purchasing can come and go with capital purchasing cycles, but we see the underlying utilization very clearly with our service and our chemistry business.\nAnd our chemistry business, by the way in pharma, has remained very solid through this cycle. Chemistry is in pharma on a global basis is consistently up in the mid-to-high single digits, which underscores the stability of that installed base. And so, our focus is simply to continue to serve our customers and position ourselves to take advantage of when demand returns. Certainly, there have been some unique factors in the pharma LC market. The tailwinds, if you will, in the middle part of the decade, particularly in China and India, yielded some headwinds as we got to the end of the decade with China and India.\nAnd on top of that, the U.S. generic market has been a tougher environment in the last year with a spike in user fees and some litigation noise in the environment.

But Andrew Alliance, we're super excited about that technology. One of the most consistent things that I've heard from customers as I go around regularly is the pressure point on sample preparation and sample automation on the front end of a lot of analyses and Andrew is truly a next generation technology platform in robotics, but also in a cloud ready software to tie it all together and to automate and replicate experiments in a much more effective way.\nWe're not going to break out revenue at this point. It's fairly modest in the big scheme of the world and we're also trying to get a handle on the opportunity, not just to sell Andrew products, but the beneficial impact that will have on pulling through Waters instruments, which is a big part of our logic.\nThe integration is going really well and in fact, the Andrew team is in town and I had a chance to sit down with them yesterday and the people within our chemistry organization that are leading the charge as well as the Andrew people, I couldn\u2019t be more excited. Everybody from the organization is staying and working very closely together to take advantage of the opportunity. So we'll give updates as we move along and look forward to sharing some more of that technology with the investment community.\nSherry Buck\nYes, and Derik, just to follow-up on the capital allocation question is, as you know, after we came out of tax reform, we started working towards a more optimal capital structure and we've been executing against that plan over the last couple of years with higher return of capital through share buybacks.\nSo as we look at going into 2020, there's a variety of factors that we look at. Our priorities from a business standpoint, our performance, et cetera, and really looking at repurchases this year of about $800 million and that would put us based upon our guide we gave today in the low 2 times leverage ratio. And so the factors that could increase us towards our kind of near-term goal of 2.5 times could be M&A opportunities. So we just look at all the different factors, and this is where we set our guide for the full year and we'll look at it each quarter and make adjustments there - updates as we go through the year.\nChristopher O'Connell\nYes, Derik, as you know, it's hard to forecast that. Well, we do have a good pipeline. We are very, very selective. We have been involved in a number of different situations and chosen to move forward just very selectively. But it is purposeful and it is proactive and we'll just have to take it as it comes, but continue to focus on those investments in terms of what they can do for our growth, what they can do for the accretion of EPS over time, as well as the returns on invested capital which are our key metrics there."]], ["And going back to the first comment on the M&A, is that $400 million to $500 million slug money on the table for potential deal activity to sort of get to the 2.5 times or is it 2.5 times somewhere in the future? ", ["Thanks, Derik. I appreciate it. Let me make a couple of quick comments on Andrew and then Sherry can talk a little about buyback program and the leverage targets and so forth, and I'm happy to add to it as well. But Andrew Alliance, we're super excited about that technology. One of the most consistent things that I've heard from customers as I go around regularly is the pressure point on sample preparation and sample automation on the front end of a lot of analyses and Andrew is truly a next generation technology platform in robotics, but also in a cloud ready software to tie it all together and to automate and replicate experiments in a much more effective way.\nWe're not going to break out revenue at this point. It's fairly modest in the big scheme of the world and we're also trying to get a handle on the opportunity, not just to sell Andrew products, but the beneficial impact that will have on pulling through Waters instruments, which is a big part of our logic.\nThe integration is going really well and in fact, the Andrew team is in town and I had a chance to sit down with them yesterday and the people within our chemistry organization that are leading the charge as well as the Andrew people, I couldn\u2019t be more excited. Everybody from the organization is staying and working very closely together to take advantage of the opportunity. So we'll give updates as we move along and look forward to sharing some more of that technology with the investment community.\nSherry Buck\nYes, and Derik, just to follow-up on the capital allocation question is, as you know, after we came out of tax reform, we started working towards a more optimal capital structure and we've been executing against that plan over the last couple of years with higher return of capital through share buybacks.\nSo as we look at going into 2020, there's a variety of factors that we look at. Our priorities from a business standpoint, our performance, et cetera, and really looking at repurchases this year of about $800 million and that would put us based upon our guide we gave today in the low 2 times leverage ratio. And so the factors that could increase us towards our kind of near-term goal of 2.5 times could be M&A opportunities. So we just look at all the different factors, and this is where we set our guide for the full year and we'll look at it each quarter and make adjustments there - updates as we go through the year.\nChristopher O'Connell\nYes, Derik, as you know, it's hard to forecast that.

But it is purposeful and it is proactive and we'll just have to take it as it comes, but continue to focus on those investments in terms of what they can do for our growth, what they can do for the accretion of EPS over time, as well as the returns on invested capital which are our key metrics there."]], ["So starting on margins, as I'm sure you guys appreciate a key pillar to the bare thesis on Waters over good times and bad has been the argument that you're pretty close to peak operating margin.\nAnd I can see where your guidance for 2020 feeds into this a bit, especially given I think this would translate into year four of operating margin coming in between 30% and 31%. ", ["Hi, Doug, this is Sherry. I'll start off maybe with the last question there about Andrew Alliance. We haven't done a breakout all the detail line item specifically. There is some impact on operating margin - operating margins and operating expenses and we gave in our guide that it's slightly dilutive to our overall EPS, so a modest amount there.\nAnd when you think about our margins - the 30% margin, one of the things we have in 2020 here is some normalization of prior year variable costs, that's a headwind for us. But as we look at our overall operating margins and getting beyond the 30%, it's really a function of our top line growth. So as we get back to our goal of being mid-single digits or above, that's when we have opportunity for higher operating margins and expansion. And so that's kind of the factor around that.\nAs far as measuring some of the investments we're making, I'd say two key areas where we're investing for growth is, continuing to invest in our R&D pipeline and that's really continuing to keep our product pipeline robust and bringing new products to market and that will play out in the top line growth, and also, we're investing in commercial capability. So tools for our sales force as far as salesforce.com, it again should play out in top line growth metrics. So that's kind of how we're looking at the investments we're making in the business."]], ["And then Sherry, as we're all trying to get underlying margin and spend trends, I wonder if you might take a stab at, just speaking to the underlying ex-currency operating expense growth, if it was, hey, we didn't have Andrew added in the year, would operating expenses accelerate and by how much?\nAnd then just for those who are wondering about mix dynamics, can you just remind us what the mix spread is at the gross or EBIT line between the TA business and the Waters business? ", ["Yes, just maybe to peel back a little bit your question on the operating expenses. Over the course of the year, Andrew - without Andrew Alliance it has a modest impact. So really the bigger drivers as we look at the increase in our operating expenses and related to our operating margin guide is really the investments we're making in their business, both R&D and commercial capabilities, and then normalization of variable expenses from 2019 are the bigger drivers on operating expense and operating margins. And then, could you repeat your second question?\nChristopher O'Connell\nI think we might be finishing the call here. So I think we're a little bit over time and maybe Steve's microphone is not live there, so let me just wrap up the call. And Steve, we can certainly follow-up on your question offline here as well as everybody else. But I want to thank everyone for your participation and questions.\nDespite the more challenging capital purchasing dynamics in 2019, we remain focused on executing on our innovation strategy and we are excited with our early progress. While our end markets have shown some near-term volatility, we are confident in their long-term growth potential and continue to invest for growth in R&D, commercial operations, and purposeful acquisitions.\nSo on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q1 2020 call, which we currently anticipate holding on April 28th, 2020. Thank you and have a great day."]], ["And three, why is a continuation of the share buyback, which has arguably depleted the company\u2019s rainy day funds with shares at historically high multiples, the best use of capital moving forward given aforementioned trends and amid concerns about structural and competitive dynamic issues? ", ["Thanks, Doug. Good morning. Okay, you asked three questions there, so I\u2019ll try to take them in order. In terms of the recurring revenue and a reflection of the overall structure of our company relative to our peers, of course, Waters as you know is more concentrated in the pharmaceutical category, particularly the small molecule category. And as I mentioned on the call, we have seen a lengthening of equipment purchasing dynamics in that sector. We\u2019re currently in environment very much driven by macro and to some degree other noise that\u2019s in the environment that has affected the small molecule business of our overall pharma business, our small molecule business, which is LC intensive, is about 70% of our overall pharma business. And currently that\u2019s experiencing more modest growth and certainly there is some impact of recurring revenues that follow from the overall instrument sales. This particular market, which again we do have unique concentration in Doug, as you know, has been steady over time. And while it\u2019s hard to tease out individual cycles, I think there\u2019s no arguing that it\u2019s in the softer phase right now for a number of those reasons that are affecting participants, whether it\u2019s on the generic side or the large pharma side. Our pharma revenue -- our pharma recurring growth, while we don\u2019t break that out, was strong in Q3 and has also been strong throughout this year and last year. And certainly some of the recurring revenues on the industrial side of the business that\u2019s been in a difficult period with global macro has certainly explained that.\nAnd as it relates to a competitive differentiation, our strongest competitive differentiation is in the pharma sector, particularly in the regulated laboratory environment and late stage development, and QA/QC. And so, there have been periods over time when the -- when that particular market segment has done very well and grown above the average of tool, other tool categories. And at this point in time, that sector of the market is growing below the average. But I think because of that, we do see the -- some evidence of pent up demand building and have confidence in that end market over the long-term.\nRelative to share loss and your second question, we\u2019ve certainly seen over an extended period of time pressure on our mass spec market share, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested so heavily to reverse that trend and we think we\u2019re really on at a bit of a pivot point relative to the new technology that\u2019s come into the market at both the high end of mass spec as well as in the core tandem quad portfolio, and with a totally new white space opportunity with BioAccord to really improve the mass spec market share position.\nOn the LC side, we\u2019ve seen generally stable conditions over time and different dynamics within UPLC, HPLC and UHPLC. But as I mentioned earlier, the strong concentration of Waters and regulated laboratories has been an advantage in stabilizing in keeping that share stable and we continue to invest against that, and in other product categories that you didn\u2019t mention, TA instruments, chemistry informatics and service we\u2019ve seen stable share trends as well. So overall, we\u2019re very focused on competing in a market that is very competitive. Certainly acknowledged strong competition but I like the position we have.\nRelative to the buyback, as you know with U.S. tax reform that came through a year and a half ago or so, we had a one-time opportunity to really reset our balance sheet and work towards in appropriate capital structure that gives us flexibility but also optimizes our balance sheet and our overall weighted average cost of capital. And certainly feel like we have enough flexibility to make the investments we want to make, both capital investments as well as M&A.\nNext question, please."]], ["So in the HPLC, UPLC market, typically those instruments have a five to eight year life cycle, life span in them and the upgrade cycle we went through in LC ended in 2017. ", ["Yes, thanks a lot, Derik. I want to do as much as I can to provide color on some of the market dynamic that we\u2019ve seen year-to-date now that we\u2019re through three quarters. But I also want to balance that with the fact that fourth quarter is our biggest quarter and a lot can play out in fourth quarter. And so before we put too fine a point on the trends in the market that would underscore our guidance for 2020, we want to see the fourth quarter play out. As you know, in some markets, this business, the LC business in particular has become pretty backend weighted. And we\u2019ve seen in some years a significant increase in business in the fourth quarter that creates an overall story for a kind of a rolling analysis. And so we want to see that play out.\nLike I said earlier, we\u2019re not assuming a big flush at the end of the quarter. And that\u2019s why we put the guidance where it is just for caution and conservatism purposes, but we do want to see it play out before we say too much about what we expect out of LC instruments in 2020. But like I mentioned earlier, the LC, the small mol LC market has been reliable historically. We are currently seeing more modest growth and believe that to some extent demand is building for investment in that area as we step into the next several years. So, we\u2019re watching it closely. We want to see what fourth quarter trends look like. And also keep in mind that when you think about the LC business, and the increase of focus on mass spec based workflows that we\u2019re seeing in the market, particularly in large molecule that LCs are an important component and with just about every mass spec system we sell, LCs come along with it. So, we\u2019re looking at LC in both the standalone LC optical market, if you will, as well as the LC-MS market."]], ["And can you talk a little bit about the European markets, just maybe some comments on Eastern versus Western Europe food, environmental, academic, governant, just a little bit more color there? ", ["Sure. Thanks. Yes, Europe has been a fairly challenging operating environment this year and just to recap the numbers overall for Europe, it was flat in the quarter and is down 2% for the year. That\u2019s -- that includes an overall European pharma number that is 1% up in the quarter and 1% up year-to-date with actually a pretty decent academic and government market up double-digits both quarter-to-date and year-to-date offsetting a similar range of declines for the industrial market. Some of the trends we\u2019ve seen year-to-date -- quarter-to-date was actually a little better in Europe industrial at a mid single-digit decline versus a double-digit decline for the year-to-date. So even though the numbers are still negative in European industrial there, they\u2019ve gotten incrementally better in the third quarter, and that\u2019s really a kind of a combination of the chemical materials market and TA being flatter, and the food and environmental market being down overall.\nIn terms of the overall environment, there\u2019s enough economic data including PMI that shows a kind of a flat to contracting economic growth environment. And certainly Brexit delays, as you mentioned, are front of mind. And we felt that through the Brexit process, much sentiment is on hold. And we do believe that in that process, there is some pent up demand building, particularly in the UK, in the Northern parts of Europe. And so we\u2019re really trying to look ahead and see when we might see an improving picture, but it\u2019s -- Europe has been kind of a flattish scenario all year long. And that said, we\u2019re super confident in our competitive position throughout Europe and believe that the concentrations we have in certain sectors are really -- provide the right context for what\u2019s happening there. But believe we\u2019re poised particularly with our new product flow to take advantage of improving market conditions when they come.\nOkay, next question, please."]], ["And then is there any way to just kind of categorize how to think about what the potential of all these new products that you\u2019re rolling out could be since it\u2019s such a critical part I think of kind of your story and kind of strategy shift that you\u2019ve made at Waters? ", ["Yes. Thanks, Dan. And absolutely job one at Waters is new product innovation. And we\u2019re in the midst of a significant transformation of our R&D efforts and really the continued achievement of innovation leadership. I think a lot of those efforts are going really well. We\u2019re extremely encouraged by the products that have come through the pipeline already with a pretty heavy focus on mass spec, given the growth opportunities in the mass spec markets as well as competitive position that we needed to improve. That was clearly the case. But kind of furthermore on the innovation side with the increases in investment, we\u2019ve built a really robust five year product roadmap that we have more clarity than we\u2019ve ever had at Waters in terms of a cadence of new product introductions across instruments, chemistries. And of course, we\u2019ll be talking a lot more about informatics in the years to come with the Waters Connect platform.\nJust a couple of quick notes on the products we\u2019ve launched, there are different type of products, of course, we\u2019ve made a number of different key line extensions on the LC side that are maybe a little bit below the radar screen, but really enhance our industry leading LC portfolio, particularly on the bio side with our Arc Bio and H-Class Bio and the binary pump and a number of other products we\u2019ve put into the market this year, certainly the chemistries that go along with the LC portfolio. I mentioned a new family of HPLC chemistries, the focus family, and of course everything we\u2019re doing in bioseparations.\nBut mass spec has really been the headline this year, BioAccord is a game changer. It is really white space opportunity in the sense of bringing highly usable, high quality, very easy to use time-of-flight mass spectrometry into the regulated laboratory space in late development and ultimately QA/QC. I\u2019ve had a chance to personally visit three or four customers this quarter who have bought BioAccord and the feedback is very positive. So, we\u2019re encouraged there.\nThe activities in the third quarter did not have as big of an impact in the third quarter. It should have a bigger impact in Q4. The tandem quads, I mentioned cronos and micro, but we did sell an encouraging number of the Cyclic IMSs in the quarter and have an even bigger order book for Q4. And then, the SYNAPT XS system which we announced the launch of in the third quarter, we did not ship in the quarter and we have communicated that -- we did communicate that to our customers. And so, we certainly have a bigger opportunity in Q4 than we had in Q3 relative to the high-res portfolio and we expect the SYNAPT XS, which is a dramatic enhancement in our well accepted SYNAPT QTOF platform. We certainly have an opportunity to ship that product this quarter that we didn\u2019t have last quarter.\nSo, that\u2019s some more color on all the new product launches. And again, I don\u2019t want to put too fine a point on a specific contribution in the fourth quarter, but we certainly expect it to increasingly be visible. And as we roll into next year with these launches under our belt, I think we\u2019ll be in a position as we guide for 2022 to put some more specificity around that."]], ["If I talk to an investor who owns Waters, they\u2019re generally talking to me about how much appeal they see because of the likely sustainability of the growth of pill count. ", ["Sure, yes. No, of course all efforts, Steve, are focused on returning to better -- much better growth. And we\u2019ve certainly seen better growth in different instrument cycles within the specific categories we focus in. At the end of the day, I think a lot about the markets we participate in and want to make sure Waters is well positioned in structurally attractive markets.

", ["Sure, Derik. Let me jump into that and start with the 4+7 as you began. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did see really a loosening of some of the spending that had been so constricted in the first quarter, particularly in the month of March. And as I mentioned, we saw some of the winners come forward with instrument purchasing from the first round. And just as a reminder, Phase 1 of the 4+7 involved a target of 31 drugs, 25 were actually completed through the tendering process. And now we do have some expectation as Phase 2 is upon us. I think there is still some lack of clarity in the market as it relates to how it all plays out, but I would characterize the tone of our customers as being a little bit more balanced than we saw them in Q1. Q1, the news was so new, the process was so new that it really had a freeze effect in the market and we did see some chilling of that freeze and some better underlying demand. As I mentioned many times, we see the overall objectives of the 4+7 program being positive for the consumer in China and ultimately for instrument purchases.

But China obviously is a dynamic market right now. We\u2019re just staying very, very focused on what we do well there which is to serve our customers and deliver technology to them. And our overall expectations for China over the rest of the year are what I\u2019d say cautious and balanced where we\u2019re seeing some great strength in areas like large molecule, biomedical research, clinical diagnostics with ongoing questions on 4+7, so we\u2019re in a little bit of a wait and see mode there. Our exposure in government food labs has been under pressure while we also see some good development on the independent side.

We don\u2019t know exactly what Phase 2 is going to look like there. We do understand that unlike Phase 1, there may be multiple winners per tender accepted which could moderate the dynamic overall.

And that\u2019s exactly the goal here is to get that instrument line moving and you correctly pointed out that there is a lot in the new cadence that we do control, and we\u2019re really excited about that. Like I said on the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve invested assertively. We\u2019ve really put our heads down to improve our overall product portfolio and we\u2019re really I think going to be able to see the positive benefits of that and it\u2019s certainly been something that\u2019s energized our customers and our field organization as we look into the back half of the year. And so we definitely try to focus on what we can control there. In terms of a lot of the macro pieces that you identified, we\u2019ve tried to put together a guide that really bakes in a lot of that question, if you will, and there are different points that you mentioned. The general industrial slowdown is certainly something that\u2019s affected our business and that\u2019s primarily a European question as our industrial business in the U.S. was actually quite positive in the quarter and has been positive. The European environment is really characterized by a lot of uncertainty particularly as you point out around Brexit.

Small mol versus last mol in China last year was in the sort of 80-20 range; 80 small, 20 large. And if you look at our overall mix of generics, it\u2019s higher in China than it is around the world.

We\u2019re thrilled that we have some orders already for the SYNAPT and the Cyclic systems, the BioAccord pipeline is strong and to throw on top of that yesterday we launched the new tandem quad which is exciting for our field organization.

As you point out, the seasonality effect in this pattern of a slow start to the quarter, in particular, as it relates to the release of budget by pharma companies and industrial companies is something we've seen. And in the example of last year and even in 2017, we saw strength at the end of the year.\nAnd so, at this point, as we look out over the course of the year, we certainly expect that the budget release cycle will lighten up and we'll get the benefit of expected planned customer spending, particularly in pharmaceuticals and in major industrial customers.\nAnd, I guess, the other major controllable from our standpoint is just the great progress we're making in product development and the increasing impact we expect from the product launches that we have new in the market and that are coming over the course of the year. On the Waters side, that is headlined by the BioAccord launch which, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, is going well in its early stages from the standpoint of training and demoing and market development.

", ["Sure, Doug. Thanks for the question. Appreciate it. I think stepping back and looking at the big picture, this is a great franchise. Waters is a very well-established and a very durable business. And really, a lot of the factors we've seen in a couple of individual quarters, of course, including Q1, are very unique to the particular mix of our business. The China business, for example, is 18% of our worldwide revenue. And as you know, the mix within China is uniquely focused on pharma, with an over-index on generic pharma and food. And so, some of the macro effects, given that we're a more specialty oriented company, certainly, have the potential to hit us in a unique way.\nRelative to product cycle, I think that's been a big area of focus for me personally. It's really my number one area of focus. And there are some aspects of the portfolio that we weren't where we needed to be. And we've invested a lot and worked hard in product development to shore that up. And as I mentioned in the previous question, we're excited about what's ahead relative to the product cycle.\nSo, we really feel like, in that way, we control our destiny and there are better things to come as that product cycle matures. And, obviously, we're doing all we can to gain visibility into some of these end market macro factors to improve the forecasting, to make sure that we can see with reasonable certainty what's ahead.\nBut like I said, Q1 was an outlier for us. It was something that, coming off the end of the year last year, was not something we expected to see. And so, we're just reacting to the changing environment and making sure that we stay very, very focused on delivering on our product pipeline and delivering on our sales execution. And as I sort of alluded to before, yes, Q1 was soft, but it's certainly not deterred that focus or the conviction in the great opportunities that lie ahead for Waters."]], ["And maybe just more of a near-term timing question, recognizing you've walked through what happened in the quarter a couple of times here, just to go back to the point you made about some of this being a function of delays in the release of capital budgets at biopharma and industrial customers, it doesn't seem like your Q2 guidance treats these delays and the release of capital budgets as a transitory issue where you recover some of that lost Q1 revenue in Q2 just because of timing. ", ["Yeah. Certainly, Doug, we don't give updates on a weekly or a monthly basis. But I would just say that the philosophy on the Q2 guide is that we don't expect all the factors that affected us in Q1 to just bring back \u2013 right as we get into April that these budget release cycle dynamics can take time to play out, that the macroenvironment which we're watching closely and studying and learning more about again doesn't just spring back in one quarter. So, I think the Q2 guide really reflects that moderated outlook that we've made for the rest of the year. And, obviously, it's our job to do the very best to deliver the most we can within that."]], ["Chris or Sherry, I want to come back to the 2Q guide, if we can, and it'd be great if you can just elaborate on whether or not you expect Europe and China specifically to return to growth in the second quarter, especially given this is kind of the third quarter in a row now, I think, where Europe has been down. ", ["Yeah. I'll just make a quick comment and then let Sherry add to it. I think we've taken a more cautious guide outlook for sure. But with that, we do expect modest improvements in both those markets. We think Europe and China remain structurally strong; and notwithstanding some the macro headwinds, are focused on some of that underlying activity. Certainly, not forecasting it to be where we thought it would be coming into the year, but we are expecting stepping back towards growth over the course of the year.

I think you covered as far as those geographies, Chris.\nChristopher O'Connell\nGreat."]], ["Is that opening up Waters to any share loss towards larger players that could use maybe their breadth to bundle and kind of how you think about that in terms of your strategy towards investment and cap deployment? ", ["Yeah. In terms of the question of focus versus breadth, I think we have a high level of conviction in our focused, specialty-oriented strategy. And we don't really see any evidence that we have difficulty competing based on a more limited product line. We think that Waters is better served with a focus on depth of application expertise in more narrowly focused areas within biopharma and small molecule pharmaceuticals, as we talked in depth at the Investor Day. We've made significant investments in the biopharm side of the business over time and we've actually gained share steadily over the last 10 or 15 years, and I'd reference you to those charts that we presented at our Investor Day.\nOf course, on the small molecule side, which is the one that experienced the volatility in the quarter, because, certainly, on the large molecule side, we had another strong quarter, on the small molecule side, we think that those factors are little more specific in nature related to the macro factors that we outlined. And looking at our market share data, particularly in LC, we see a very strong and stable and sticky market share position. And I think as everyone knows, certainly, one quarter, that type of situation doesn't move around a lot.\nSo, we're confident that the effect we saw on the small mol business in particular in Q1 are really related to these market factors. And we're just very, very focused on continuing to invest in our technology position and our application science to be the very best company in the specialty manner that we set out to be."]], ["Is that global or is that in a certain geographic region?\nAnd then, secondly, would you be able to break out kind of what your outlook is for Waters instrument growth this year and how much of that is contingent on new product sales or the new product cycle versus the existing portfolio benefiting from improving end market outlook? ", ["Sure. Thanks, Sung Ji. Yeah. So, the BioAccord launch has been really exciting. We officially launched the product at the well-characterized biopharmaceutical conference. And really, a lot of the early activity we saw was in some of the developed markets, US and Western Europe, in particular. But one of the things that happened more mid-quarter was we had a significant launch in China. And literally hundreds of customers attend a really robust and kind of high-energy launch event that led to a variety of customer relationship developments and getting people into demo type situations.\nI use the word market development because this is really a new category for regulated laboratories for high-resolution mass spectrometry in a compliant package to really lead us into method process development and, ultimately, QA/QC for large molecules in the MAM space. And that's, obviously, kind of a new direction for the market.\nWe continue to do all the right things to develop that market. We, obviously, have taken orders and shipped some units, although we never really expected to do all that much of that in the earlier part of the year. And so, I'm really looking at metrics around MQLs or marketing qualified leads as well as that demoing activity.\nAnother key aspect of our launch readiness is to forward place the BioAccord system in our own demonstration labs at an accelerated pace compared to what we've done historically with other systems. And that's been really effective because it's brought many more customers into the demo phase which can ultimately accelerate quoting and ordering.\nAnd so, it's all systems go. And we continue to press on that opportunity. And by the way, we've always thought, along with the launch, it creates an opportunity for our sales folks to have a broader conversation about Waters and the collateral positive impacts of having new technology and how that affects the rest of our product line. Interestingly enough, it's had a positive effect on our overall high-resolution mass spectrometry portfolio.\nSo, anyway, that's just one platform and, certainly, there are others coming. And as you allude to, something that will have a positive effect on our instrument performance over the course of the year are those new product launches. So, I don't want to get into too many specifics around the exact dollar amount or percentage increment that we expect from new products over the course the year, but we do expect that contribution to strengthen over the course of 2019."]], ["I was wondering if you could \u2013 if you had any thoughts as it relates to share and if you've seen any impact on your share in addition to impact from the markets?

", ["Yeah. A fair question. And I would just say, BioAccord has been the headliner simply because of the timing and also the strategic importance of that platform, and both the market segment it's targeted at as well as the conviction we have in the solution. The other one that we haven't specifically mentioned, but you are well aware of, Steve, is the cyclic high mobility, high-resolution mass spectrometer that we continue to expect to launch at the ASMS meeting coming up here shortly. So, we're really excited about that. And, obviously, we're going to get a benefit of that in the second half of the year.\nAnd what I'll just say on the other product launches that we'll provide details on as we move along is that there are a number of what I might call more iterative technologies. If BioAccord and cyclic IMS are new platform technologies, we have a variety of other iterative technologies in both our LC and our mass spec portfolio which will benefit us in particular because those technology categories and product families are well accepted platforms in the market. They can benefit from the refresh as we have them.\nSo, I'd rather stop there from the standpoint of describing the new product introductions.

And then, of course, as you alluded to will be supplemented by other instrument launches throughout the year.\nSo with respect to the regions and starting with India, as noted in my comment, Q4 was interesting. It was slightly below prior year, very slightly below prior year but for context, the prior years was our number one quarter ever in India. So this fourth quarter was actually our second biggest quarter historically in India. So while the year-over-year growth wasn't there, certainly the volume was good.

Okay.\nOkay, maybe the next question?"]], ["Chris, I'd like to start with the pharma recovery, I was just curious as to whether you think there was any kind of onetime dynamics here in terms of budget push. ", ["Sure great. So starting with pharma, Tycho, we'll just give a couple of comments there. So we grew 7% in the quarter and that was clearly a strong quarter and better than we'd seen all year overall. And I would also note that pharma results was delivered even with India obviously being flattish and as you know India is by and large a pharma market. I would say there was nothing unusual as it related to a flush at the end of the year.\nWe certainly have seen the pattern in the U.S. for the last couple of years where we have a slower start to the year and a faster finish that that kind of manifested itself again. But I think we were encouraged, we are encouraged by the balance in pharma as I mentioned for the year in retrospect, we ended up solid in small mol and very strong and large mol for the year. And we are particularly encouraged in the quarter by high res mass spec in pharma.\nSo, as I mentioned, the tone has been improving in mass spec and in the period we probably saw that most acutely was high res mass spec in pharma. U.S. pharma was strong and even within Europe, pharma was better than the other market category. In Europe, it was still relatively modest, but it was positive. So, I think heading into the year again taking a balanced view, there's a lot of dynamics affecting the pharmaceutical industry. But what's unmistakable to me is just the pace of innovation that's happening.\nAnd, we talk a lot about that in large molecule. But there's also quite a bit going on in small molecule and a diversification and a globalization of the generics business. So, where we typically see a lot of good generics business and revenue out of markets like India and China, we're seeing the United States contribute a lot of growth in generics as some of those companies look to increase their footprint in the United States.\nSo, maybe seguing from there to the BioAccord and you use the term pent-up demand. It's interesting because I think there is a gap there. And just let me clarify, we do see the BioAccord ultimately finding its way to QA/QC, but we're really targeting method development and process development. So late stage development where methods are being developed. As you know, today, there are many, many different tests being run on bio molecules. I've seen data that as many as 30 or 50 different assays are being run on bio molecules. And that just simply over time is going to require more powerful tools.\nI actually just after -- actually after your conference in San Francisco, I went out to the field and visited one of the major biotech companies and sat down with their development people. And we had a hour and a half discussion on the pressures on speed to market and cost and the frustrations they have moving faster on multi attribute monitoring, because they just don't have the right tools. The tools today that are sold into there, including our own are too manual, too slow and the data systems are not fully ready to handle the regulatory requirements.\nAnd so this particular group, as well as many of the folks that have seen the BioAccord are very excited and want to learn more, in fact this group was actually going to come to the WCBP meeting in D.C. next week, where we're going to be showcasing the system just to see it. But all the requirements that are unmet today around robustness, reproducibility, easy to operate, the performance informatics, that's a gap in the market. And we think we have the right product at the right time.\nSo again, the way technology rolls out in this space is a matter of happening over years, not months. And so, while we do assume incremental revenue coming from the BioAccord this year, we'll not put too finer point on that at the outset and we'll update you more on that as we get through the year and obviously we're going to try to go a little deeper on this exact topic at our Investor Day coming up at the end of February.\nNext question please?"]], ["And then on BioAccord, I understand you don't want to kind of put numbers around it, but can you maybe just talk to the degree of pent up demand you see into the launch.

", ["Sure. Ross, as you know the Chinese market is one we watch very closely and is constantly changing in terms of policy and standards and so forth. And I can't speak specifically to the policy changes you're referring to, I am generally familiar with some of those directions and they are consistent where the Chinese government has been in the past. I mean, to the extent the government has an interest in consolidating the generic space, that's being done for the reasons of scale.\nThe government is intent upon increasing patient access to basic medical therapies and in whatever tactic is needed to do that if it's consolidation, if it's regionalization. It's all being driven at that aim and that's all going to drive volume and as you know our small mol business is very much a volume oriented type of business.\nAnd on the other end of the spectrum the promotion of innovation that's clearly happening there is tremendous activity in China around the development of biosimilar companies and even novel drug innovators. And so I think in that way, China is sort of a micro chasm, if you will of what's going in the world, there is business for us at both ends of the volume side of generics and also on the kind of testing intensive side of the innovation.\nAnd just in terms of our business in rough terms and we'll update this further at the Investor Day, but in rough terms two-thirds of our business is related to the small molecule world that's sort of generics volume business and one-third relating to the bio molecule development with very little in QA/QC. But we see bio molecules going down that same path, just like our small molecule business grew up around late state development, method development, process development and evolved into manufacturing quality control we see large molecule going down the same path, which is why we're investing so much to make sure that we can serve the market to make that transition. And, at this point both ends of that formula are important to us.\nNext question please."]], ["And then also on that just sort of what are your sort of taking plans in terms of preparing for Brexit because you do have that big UK facility in Manchester. ", ["Sure, again thanks Derik for the questions, and I may ask for a clarification on the pull forward part of it. But let me jump into the academic government. We did have a -- as you know really kind of a strong year if you will in academic and government at 7% growth with a little less growth at the end of the year. And that was really a function of Europe, but we actually had growth in the U.S. and strong growth in China and Asia in academic and government in the quarter, which really reflected a pattern all year along with a little bit of softness in Europe.\nIn Europe it probably reflects more that wait and see kind of tone in some of the markets related to some of the macro conditions that's about as good of a thought I can have there. There is a bit of a mix in the academic and government sector between biomedical research where it's been weaker and pharma discovery where it's been stronger. And again for reference keep in mind, our academic and government is a significantly smaller part of our portfolio than everything else and even within that our academic and government business is about two-thirds or more academic and university and therefore the government piece is smaller.\nBut, we're watching that closely and like I said earlier it was nice in Europe, even though it was a little bit of soft year than we expected that pharma was a -- could offset that some a little bit as well.\nSo from a Brexit standpoint, we watch Brexit closely, I have been very tuned into this since the beginning. As you point out we have a large research facility in Wilmslow in the UK. There is obviously a range of possibilities as to what could happen with the article 50 process and while it seems that most more recent political events have made a hard Brexit probably less likely because I think politicians on both sides are sort of in violent agreement, if you will, that a hard Brexit is the worst scenario and whether it's a pause or whether it's a renegotiation or whether it's even a new referendum, there is a lot of other things that could happen.\nBut even with that, we've decided that it's prudent to prepare a contingency plan for short-term disruption in the case of a hard Brexit. And so we are well down the path on that contingency plan and that plan is simply designed to maintain our servicing of customers. About 4% of our worldwide revenue is in the UK and obviously you can imagine there would be some forward stocking just to prepare for any disruptions.\nAnd then furthermore on the export side making sure that we have plenty of inventory, finished goods inventory that comes from the UK, outside the UK. I will say that over time, we have involved the majority of our mass spec production out of the UK into Ireland and other places. And so really Wilmslow is primarily research and development facility with some smaller volume high res lines that we can certainly manage through in that type of a scenario.\nSo, while I think a hard Brexit personally is a very low probability, we're just trying to be prudent in preparing for that. But on the pull forward question and I'm happy to get a clarifying point from you on that. I don't really see evidence of that particularly in Europe. So, I think if we -- if there was more of a pull forward dynamic, we probably would have seen stronger results in Europe, but I just -- I think the people are more in a wait and see mode is how I'd characterize it."]], ["And then my follow-up question, can you help me think about the sources of operating leverage in 2019 a year where you're investing in sales and marketing ahead of some new product launches, you've been growing R&D at twice the rate of revenue, and gross margins tend to be kind of flat. ", ["Sure. So probably characterized first, just kind of overall operating margin leverage as we look at it. And I'd say, we really look at kind of the two big factors as our top line growth goals that we have, and then what are our needs to invest in the business to drive that top line growth. And then there's obviously other factors such as whatever FX fall through throughout the course of the year and offsetting inflation, et cetera.\nAnd so, as we set our plan for this year of the 4% to 6% revenue guide, and then our EPS growth, we look to be able to deliver modest operating margin improvement. If you look at our 2018 results where we ended the year with about 4% constant currency growth, we were still able to deliver about 50 basis points of operating income improvement.\nSo those are kind of the factors that we look at because as we learned from 2018, there's a lot of moving parts. So we really set out to within our revenue guide just to have some modest operating leverage as we look at the different levers we have to pull."]], ["Just was wondering, if you could comment there on what you're doing to hold in SG&A and if that's sustainable going forward.\nAnd then I guess secondly, for Sherry maybe, your guidance here for the first quarter, the midpoint looks like about 7% earnings growth, compared to the full year of 12% to 13% earnings growth. ", ["Yes, maybe I'll take -- thanks, Steve. I'll take a quick one on SG&A and Sherry can certainly add to that plus talk about the guide a little bit. If you look at the overall body of work in 2018, I think we managed the P&L very well to gain some modest operating leverage, while investing heavily in R&D.\nAnd as we got into the fourth quarter in part given some variable expense dynamics, as well as the investments pre-market, if you will ahead of the BioAccord launch that ticked up a little bit. But we have a number of levers to pull relative to cost initiatives and we're doing more than ever before in the company.\nNow in our third year of kind of a new type of budgeting cycle to really make sure we're pivoting resources and allocating resources to the things that give us the best chance for growth. And so, I think we're comfortable that we'll continue to manage our P&L, our SG&A well and over any reasonable rolling period like we saw in 2018, get that balance right. So Sherry, I don't know if you want to say more about that plus the guide.\nSherry Buck\nSo I'll address your question on the guide for Q1. I'd say there is a couple of factors in Q1 that is impacting the overall EPS growth, a comment I talked about is the tax rate. So just to put the tax rate in perspective, last year is our first year coming out of Tax Reform, we guided to 13% to 15% tax rate, as you know with our current results we ended at the low end of that range with a variety of factors around evolving a clarification on Tax Reform some discrete items and kind of the mix of our business.\nSo, for full year next year, we're guiding to a full year tax rate in the range of 14% to 15%, just kind of narrowing that. But in the first quarter kind of that range of the tax rate has a bigger effect in Q1 because last year we had an exceptionally low tax rate it was about 11%.\nSo as you look at the flow of our EPS from Q1 and then look at that in contrast to the full year the tax rate is definitely has a bigger impact in Q1. And then I'd say the second item in Q1 would be the impact of FX, it's about a 3% headwind in the first quarter and kind of overall you're seeing more impact in the first half on the FX than in the full year. So I'd say those would be the two big factors.\nChristopher O'Connell\nAnd operator we have time for just one more question."]], ["I think, Chris, it would help if you just try to think about 2018 in totality and compare that to the sort of historical norm of mid single-digit plus, Pharma growth which we think of generally is the bellwether for Waters. ", ["Yes. Thanks, Steve, for the question. And I think you characterized it well, the pattern we\u2019ve seen throughout the year has shown some bumps in the road that we're not fully expected as we headed into the year and in a couple of key geographies and product lines. Obviously, the most consistent headwind we've seen over the course of the year has been in India, which has knocked down our growth by a 1% or point or more and we can go deeper on India with what a year-ago was a customer base working through the GST tax implementation issues has evolved a little bit to some broader economic concerns, obviously the rupee is way down on a year-over-year basis. And so, a variety of factors including some political uncertainty in India have really contributed to that being consistent headwind. And outside of that, we\u2019ve had some pockets of market related issues in Europe that we saw in the quarter. That said, we\u2019ve some real positives that we\u2019ve seen over the course of the year as well. China's been very consistent as a tailwind and the U.S which started out quite slow has been improving particularly in Pharma, which is probably the thing that we watch most closely. And so -- as I look at the year in totality and on your point of innovation, we\u2019ve just tried to remain steadfastly focused on the execution of what is a really exciting multiyear innovation cycle. This year, in 2018, particularly in the back half of the year, we've seen more incremental product launches than the prior two years combined and those really should start showing their promise and of course as we look ahead to 2019, we have -- what I consider non-incremental type of product launches coming with the BioTOF program, some new entrants in high resolution mass spec and in some other areas. So, that's really our core strategy. We\u2019ve not wavered from that. And as we\u2019ve worked through some of the geography and product line bumps in '18, I think we're -- we remain very confident in the outlook for the business long-term."]], ["And I guess some of this is going to go back to the new product launches, which I guess address some of the markets where you were not maybe competing as aggressively as you would like. ", ["Yes, sure. Thanks, Ross. Like I mentioned before, if you look to our total first half mass spec product line, we did see some modest improvement in the third quarter and we actually had a reasonably challenging comp year-over-year in mass spec as well. Like I said, we saw a bit of a bounce and some encouraging signs in the high res segment, and as I\u2019ve said many times before, we really do like our core position there, we are a little late in a product cycle on that and looking forward to new products. But I feel like we are moving in the right direction in mass spec. We\u2019ve got a very solid core 10 quad position and as you point out, our near-term product pipeline is robust and we are getting closer to it. For example, on the BioTOF program, we're well into a really exciting phase of customer evaluation and demo of the system, some of which I\u2019ve personally participated in, and we do have a number of near-term new products as well in the high res and broader mass spec category. So like I said, I feel like we are moving in the right direction. It's an important product line for the Company and feel that it's reasonably stable in the near-term and hopefully getting better."]], ["And I guess on the capital allocation side, as you were sort of debating the merits of sort of more aggressive M&A or other technology purchases, again sort of the share repurchase, it seems like you guys are still remaining fairly biased to repurchase as you take up the leverage. ", ["Yes, now that's a terrific question, Ross, and we\u2019ve -- as Sherry pointed out, say, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time discussing the capital allocation, because for us tax reform was a total game changer. We were very locked on our balance sheet beforehand and now we're very unlocked and have a lot of financial flexibility, given the very strong economics of our business and global cash flows. Our priorities for capital allocation are, first, to grow the business and in any scenario, buyback, we are retaining plenty of financial flexibility to invest in the business, headlined by organic innovation capital expense. And as I mentioned, doing more and more to make sure we are close to what's happening outside of our four walls relative to innovation in technology and in considering very purposeful additions. Certainly in a small way you saw that earlier in the year with the Prosolia-DESI IP acquisition. And we will continue to maintain sufficient cash to invest in all of the growth attributes. But with that, certainly we have incremental capacity through our cash on hand, plus borrowing capacity to enhance our buyback program and we feel that now is the right time to put our balance sheet to work and to fully deploy our cash and partially deploy our borrowing capacity to work towards a more optimal capital structure."]], ["And then maybe just on the BioTOF, it sounds interesting, but the features that you mentioned also sound a lot like some of the ones that you hear when other LCMS players launch products. ", ["Yes, I will say a little bit more Dan, because we obviously want to give you and the investment community a more complete description at the right time when we get ready for launch. But like I said, from a product development standpoint this has been, in my view, a really successful program where we\u2019ve really hit on all of our key milestones along the way with a system that is very much designed for what the market needs today and in the future. And the reality is the systems in the market that are serving this category today have multi-attribute monitoring and are mostly and including what we're selling into this segment today, really research grade systems that really require expert users have more complex software, can be more variable in terms of reproducibility, require certainly more service from higher skilled engineers and are really more designed for cutting-edge performance as opposed to reproducibility and robustness and regulatory compliance. And so, we are obviously trying to build on the great success we\u2019ve had on the small molecule side with HPLC, plus UV detection and power chromatography data systems to provide a really fit for purpose solution for the accelerating segment of the market in late stage development and ultimately QA/QC with a very versatile, easy to use, robust time-of-flight type analyzer. So I will kind of leave it at that for now, which is consistent with I think what we've said, but we're also doing the commercialization process quite differently, say in the -- than historically, where we're doing a very robust deep engagement with many key customers to test and trial the system, to get that final piece of feedback and to really demonstrate to our users that this is quite different from what they see on the market today."]], ["Chris, if we look back over the past three years, core growth has gone from, I think it's 6.6% to 5.7% and now to an expected 3% to 4% this year.

You know, there were some tough comps for example, in China and India in particular in Q2 of last year was very, very strong industrial.\nThere was also dynamic within the environmental business where the EPA had been some pretty big purchasing activity last year where that is not yet recurred in this year and so there is lot of puts and takes.

So really we are continuing to invest in our next generation chromatography data systems, I personally had a chance to review a lot of that work.

So your first side of question about the FX dynamics in this quarter, maybe just recapping for the top line, the Euro and the Yen is really what drove kind of the FX of 2% on the top line and we saw that favorability flow through the gross margin, we had probably a slight positive impact on the gross margin.\nBut the dynamic that happened in the second quarter because of our Euro and pound and particularly that our cost base that we have in the pound that impacted our operating expense. So that kind of flowed through on our operating expenses as a headwind on our operating expense line. So we have guided on the EPS, we thought it would be $0.01 positive and we ended up a little bit more positive than that.\nAs far as the cash flow normalizing, I would say it would be more of a return to growth and we like to look at our cash flow conversion, at $0.27 for the half, we also probably see that improving by really returning to growth. The second quarter was really a dynamic of timing of our estimated tax payments of the results of the U.S Tax Reform.

", ["Thanks Doug. I think for the most part I would just say in India, just a follow-up on those questions. The Q2 kind of incremental strength we saw in Pharma was probably some combination of a little bit of pent-up demand plus just a warmed up purchasing tone of the customers as I mentioned.\nAnd Pharma was positive in Q2, is certainly not where we wanted it to be in India or where we expected to be in the back half of the year, and I guess looking at the big picture it doesn't necessarily surprise us that as we sort of anticipated when we were on the call last quarter that it would sort of build over the course of the rest of the year. So that's moving along as we expected it to.\nRelative to the U.S. I think it's a fairly simple answer to your question, which is, yes, we do expect the U.S. to grow in the back half of the year, and that is just based on as I mentioned earlier reasonable expectation for typical year end purchasing activity in somewhat of a pattern that we saw last year.\nSo we are just focused on the basics there and making sure that we understand the tone of our customers that were quoting activity and how we translate that into their deployment of their budgets, which have been conservative in the first part of this year as I mentioned."]], ["So obviously the dollars has been moving quite a bit and getting stronger and I know previously there is been some issues with your [Indian] (Ph) customers losing purchasing power and obviously things moving around and currently even China.

At this point in the year we still see a decent balance between pharma and industrial and some of the research categories. Certainly from a geography standpoint we feel the U.S. is in better shape heading into the year than it was a year ago with continued positive outlook for big geographies like China and Europe. Obviously we've talked about India. I think the India \u2013 the last year in India is easier to see in retrospect especially the dynamic at the end of the March fiscal year. And so we're confident in the India situation recovering.

We try to put a plan together that seeks to balance the changes and assumptions that inevitably occur over the course of the year.

So the two new products are the ACQUITY PLUS, which is an enhancement of the overall ACQUITY platform it\u2019s outlined in then the ACUITY ARC bio, which is taking the arc platform, which as you know is a transitional technology between HPLC and UHPLC methods. And making it more directly compatible with bio molecules just like we have an UPLC already the ACQUITY bio now we have the ACQUITY ACR bio. Interesting enough the ACQUITY ACR historically has been a little more of an emerging markets product is strongest start off the launch was really in China. But as we see the trend of product development on a large molecule we see this ACQUITY ACR bio being much more broadly adopted product and we\u2019re excited about that.\nOn the ACQUITY PLUS, I think, that just adds to the breadth and strength of the family and again the key driver for UPLC methods has been in some of the more \u2013 in really biotech end of the market and new drugs that are being developed. There we've talked about before there's really not an upgrade cycle as it relates to people migrating a particular molecule from HPLC to UPLC it's really when new molecules are being developed. And certainly as we look at some of the bigger opportunities in developing QA/QC in biotech, UPLC is really going to be the standard we believe and that's why we continue to invest in that platform."]], ["Sherry when you look at that tax rate I mean it's going to a lot of variability over the last couple years I know some of that is just because the tax law changes.

I say there's still a lot of moving parts and really seeing all the regulations coming out supporting the U.S. tax reform Q1 I can say was one more favorable than what we were expecting because of some very discrete items. Our expectation is, is that will normalize throughout the remaining quarters. And so our full guidance still remains at 13% to 15%.

", ["Yes, thanks, Tim. Appreciate the question. In terms of long-term goals of net cash or net debt, I wouldn\u2019t say that we have a pre-described formula in our head. We want to do the right things to be great capital allocators. I think that\u2019s the bottom line. Like I said, cash is a great asset for us to have and we want to make sure we are flexible to invest opportunistically when the right opportunities present themselves across that entire range of capital allocation priorities. If that means that we are more cash heavy until that happens fine, if that means at some point we find the right opportunity to invest and get more debt heavy that\u2019s fine too. It\u2019s really going to be a function of the return on invested capital, which have been consistent in terms of being the priority and at what point in time those investments are most fruitful. As it relates to changes in R&D and CapEx, I think you have seen me really emphasize R&D in terms of the returns to the company and the organic growth strategy. In fact, I was looking at some numbers last night and our R&D over the last 5 years has very steadily grown and conservatively grown from about 7.5% of products revenue that\u2019s excluding service where there isn\u2019t any R&D, but 7.5% of products revenue to 8.5% of products revenue over the last 5 years in a very gradual study way and I like that. I am pleased with that, because we have also been able to cover that with efficiency gains in other parts of the P&L to deliver modest ongoing operating leverage. As it relates to CapEx, we have been a pretty steady 3.5% to 4% of sales type CapEx company and CapEx investments and opportunities to invest in CapEx, we would look at, but if there anything major we would obviously give more information as we assess those opportunities. So I would characterize the answer overall is open minded, but very disciplined and patient to B grade capital allocators."]], ["Then maybe just as a follow-up, two quick geography questions on Europe, obviously things right there in a pretty good place, can you touch on Western versus Eastern Europe and then how those two shape up for the year when think about your overall outlook for the region in \u201818. ", ["Sure. In terms of Europe, it was noteworthy in Europe this year to have the type of consistency we had across the year. And it was I would say consistency quarter-to-quarter that was somebody unusual historically. And I think it reflects the broad base of reasonable economic conditions in the background. We actually had kind of an unusual dynamic where for the better part of the year all four regions within Europe were in positive territory Northern Europe, Western Europe, Central Europe and \u2013 sorry Northern Europe, Central Europe, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe had a good year that that business had been down and in some prior years, but had a reasonable year. I think we are hoping for again a balanced outlook as we come to this year, but I certainly don\u2019t know enough to forecast individual sub-geographies with any precision. But Europe has been a solid performer for us really driven by that solid base of pharmaceutical customers throughout Europe as well as reasonable biomedical research world. Japan had a solid year. Japan was a pretty typical, kind of low to mid single-digit type grower for Waters in both the quarter and the year.

So on the gross margin line, the kind of big factors around that obviously with higher volume or higher sales we would be able to give positive impact being able to offset fixed cost absorption, but really mix plays a really big part as we look at the mix of our sales both geographically as well as service revenues. So, service revenues, as it continues to grow and be a big part of our business, it\u2019s actually dilutive to our gross margin and accretive on our operating income line. So, we have really tried to look at kind of the whole picture how we improve margins. So, there are things underway and operating efficiencies to be able to improve gross margin, but there are a lot of pushes and falls and we are guiding to a 58.5% to 59% and we will be working to see if there are other opportunities to improve that, but mix kind of shakes out during the course of the year."]], ["And one follow-up in terms of you have obviously highlighted in past that smaller accounts and biotechs have become increasingly bigger part of the revenue at Waters over the years and could you give us your sense of sustainability of that over than next year knowing that there is the tax reform driven M&A potentially here and obviously I mean I agree the point that you don\u2019t have the M&A crystal ball neither do we.

There is definitely a bifurcation as you pointed out between the US and Europe and you know I\u2019ll first make a comment more on the pharmaceutical business. As you know the pharma business is a very global business and clearly what our experience here and sort of the short-term we are seeing the larger multinational pharma company is favoring. The more friendly operating environment in Europe, right now and that\u2019s obviously driven by more and more certain environment on tax and regulation and trade.\nAnd so, the U.S. does feel like its bending a little bit of wait and see mode, but like we said in the call, we definitely saw a sequential improvement in that tone in the U.S. certainly Q2 was better than Q1 and Q3 was better than Q2, so hopefully we\u2019re stepping out of that and as you know sometimes these companies have cycled their purchasing activity between the U.S. and Europe and that\u2019s what we think we\u2019re seeing right now.\nIn the industrial sector, we actually saw a growth in both the U.S. and in Europe, which was encouraging. Our industrial performance is pretty broad-based right now, and in academic and government we also saw a growth in both the U.S and in Europe.

", ["Sure. Yes, happy to address those and those are two related but different questions. So I'll just start with the US question and really the broad US market and the patterns we saw in the first half. Clearly, I think when we look at the US, we are looking at both the broader and business environment, but also our comps, which were strong in the second quarter here.\nThe US business environment is clearly seen across multiple markets, not just pharma, and you know, we do believe there is some holding back due to the uncertainties with government policy et cetera. Some companies are holding back and some companies are investing elsewhere. Clearly, the US is a little slower right now and Europe is a little faster.\nAs you pointed out, US was actually better in Q2 than Q1, not exactly where we wanted to be, but clearly heading in the right direction. And I think you know, it's looking at broad trends and the order book and demand, I would say that I'm cautiously optimistic that the US will normalize.\nWe think the demand is still there and are assuming some improvement in the back half of the year in the US, but certainly not assuming a strong big bounce. But we are assuming some improvement.\nYou know, as it relates to pharma and I think the best way to look at this picture is globally and is with the rolling trends. The quarter that we had in pharma I think reflects timing in comps. Recall that a year ago in the second quarter our pharma business worldwide grew 12% with strong comps in particular in Asia, and I think that if you look the slightly bigger picture of say a rolling six month or a rolling 12 month, our year-to-date pharma is up 6% in our last 12 months and pharma is up 8%.\nAnd so you know, I think when I look at pharma, I think pharma is healthy and I think it's balanced on strong comps. So you know, looking at the back half, I think it's on track and expect at or above historical trend lines on a strong base from 2016. So that's how I\u2019d characterize the pharma picture overall."]], ["You attributed this to slow budget releases, but at that point noted that trends had improved at the end of Q1 and in early Q2.\nBased on your US growth performance for the quarter and pharma growth performance, it's not obvious that the trend of improvement that you described carried through the quarter.\nSo the question is did revenue tail off at the end of the quarter in the US relative to what you would have expected given the early momentum you described.

And so we do in the first quarter tend to look a little more that balanced to the quarter.\nBut you know with the benefit of looking at the first half you know, I think we tried to point out in my commentary that you know, the trends in the US are probably more reflective of the broad economic backdrop and questions and uncertainties in the US that many companies are facing.\nAnd so you know, I don't want to get into too many details around the shape of revenue in the middle of a second quarter. But it is true that our second quarter was definitely better in the US in pharma and in other markets than in Q1.

My comment on better than Q1 reflected the US business overall, but specifically pharma, which was as you know not quite positive, but definitely better than Q1.\nAnd so you know, I think what I look at is the underlying tone of demand in the market I talked to a lot of customers as you know and try to get into this dialogue and you know when I look at the combination of the demand which I still think is there, certainly in some cases global companies can move some of that demand to other parts of the world, which we do see a little bit of.\nBut you know, there is probably some holding back and the combination of that and in our order book gives me I'd say some cautious optimism that we should see a continuing pattern of improvement.

Keep in mind, most of our business in biotech is in the development stage and you know, we're excited about that because that portends greater volumes, as some of that type of testing moves into the more routine operational workflows later in the cycle. So our perspective is probably a little more narrow there in the development phase."]], ["And I think we're all trying to just get a sense for like what was driving that deceleration?\nAnd then another way to think about it is just, you said that you felt comfortable that that was going to kind of maintain trend line. ", ["Sure. Fair question. You're right, a recent trend line has been up in the high single digits, you know, in \u201816 pharma was 10. Like I said rolling 12 month pharma is 8. We did head into - we are heading into a period here of Q2 and even Q3 with very strong global pharma comps.\nBut when I say trend line Tim, recall I'm referring to more of the long-term trend line of the pharma market, which for us has been in that 6% range. And so as we talked about at the beginning of the year, as we look at the year we always you know, kind of revert back to our broad historical trend lines that maybe not the near-term trends, but the broad long-term trends.\nAnd in pharma you know, that's more than that in that 6% range. Certainly as it relates to stacked comps. You know, in Q1 the last two Q1s the stack comp is 9, in the last two Q2s stat comp is 8. So that's been more of a near term phenomenon.\nBut you know, as you know, we don't always assume everything goes right and we forecast more of a long-term trend line for that and that I would say is where we're looking at it for the year we're in now."]], ["Chris, you mentioned the strengthening industrial business and it sounds as though quite a bit of that is coming from the TA business but also from the Waters and with some contribution from the new Discovery platform. ", ["No. We had a good food quarter. Food has been a very consistent contributor. The applied markets there continue to be buoyed by some of the factors we talked about in depth at our investor conference in terms of rising regulation particularly in Asia, increasing consumer demand for quality and purity in food supply and, frankly, an up-tiering of technology in a lot of those methods particularly in the research labs.\nWe definitely had strength across the core LC-MS workflows, particularly given our strong product position in the Xevo tandem quad. You'll recall last year, we launched the Xevo TQ-XS, and that complements the TQD and the TQ-S micro as probably the industry's strongest offering in that core tandem quad category for the applied workflows. And I think that's put us in a great position in food, and we've seen consistently strong performance there including this quarter."]], ["And looking at the large molecule drug market, are you able to tell, based on the sales cycle, the conversations you've had with customers or the types of systems that those customers are making. ", ["It's a really good question. I think first of all, we've seen consistent demand in large molecule testing. And as I alluded to earlier, that core LC-MS product position that we have and the increasing adoption of LC-MS methods in the regulated testing in the development and even getting now into QA/QC is a trend that I think belies some of the uncertain factors that you described.\nThe diversity of innovation in the biopharm sector, I think, supports this. It's not just the small sort of capital-dependent companies that are doing this work. Really, a large segment of the innovator drug approach overall in companies large and small and through all the contract players and other new models emerging are all providing for a fairly broad, really, company set doing this work that probably provides more sustainability than, maybe, we would've thought in the past.\nSo anyway, we watch it carefully. It's an important market. And while the smaller companies can be lumpier, there's a lot more market participation right now."]], ["I know we've cut a lot of this data a couple of different ways, but I was hoping maybe if you could look at it from the standpoint of how academic did between developed markets and emerging markets. ", ["Yeah. Thanks, Isaac. And, again, like I said earlier, this is a smaller market and tends to be highly variable, and that's true overall but also by geography. As I alluded to, U.S. was actually a modest positive in the quarter where Europe was more of a decline, of course, offset by all the great pharmaceutical and industrial business.\nThe emerging markets business is, again, relatively small in proportion, and that's a little bit of a mixed picture. It's very, very small in say, in India and in China. We've seen good performance out of that on a reasonably consistent basis.\nSo, again, we don't want to cut it too finely just because I think we could maybe draw the wrong conclusions because things tend to bounce back and forth quarter-to-quarter. What I tend to look at on that government and academic business is what does the rolling trend look like. And I think if I look back at the rolling 12 months and what lies ahead, it does tend to smooth out over time. But for the full year, we definitely see opportunities based on our new product launches and look for more balance over that type of time period."]], ["Do you have any sense, Chris, that over the last couple of quarters that the developers of biopharmaceuticals have become any more or less inclined to in-source or outsource R&D or are they doing more in-sourcing today than they were a couple of quarters ago?\nAnd then for Sherry, just a question on currency. ", ["Thanks, Steve. I appreciate the questions. First of all, just on the in-source, outsource. It's a really good question and I try to get my handle on the same question. I think that a couple of quarters' perspective is probably too short of a window to really see any meaningful changes in that model. I guess if I look at it over more of a 12 or 24-month kind of period, I think the trend is unmistakable towards outsourcing, particularly in later-stage development and manufacturing.\nAnd so, when I look at our business in that area, when I look at the success and the aggregation of some of the players in the CDMO market, that to me points to more and more uptake of those types of services, particularly as they have the ability to provide plug-and-play sort of comprehensive solutions to the pharma companies.\nSo, I wouldn't say that I've seen any change in that kind of broad trend in the last couple of quarters. But it is something that we watch closely because it's an important topic.\nSherry, you want to comment on FX?\nSherry L. Buck - Waters Corp.\nSure. I think your question was around the operating expenses in the quarter. And our operating expenses overall in the quarter were in line with our plan. And on a constant currency basis, they grew about 6% versus last year. And our plans for the full year are to monitor our expenses such that they grow at a rate less than our top line. And when you look at the FX impact in the operating expenses, it had a favorable impact, as you can see."]], ["Would you be able to comment qualitatively on your confidence that pharma growth can be sustained, industrial is going to continue to improve, and I think you also mentioned some expectation for improvement in the government and academic end market.

We have watched order trends carefully in Q1 and we want to get a jumpstart on the year from a backlog perspective, and we were able to achieve our goals from the standpoint of our order book. And it's not an order book that we can look out with great certainty, say, two or three quarters out but all of the indications early in the year are that the order book is a positive relative to what we're trying to achieve."]], ["So, Sherry, when we think about the 12% tax rate guide for this year, is that something we should think about for 2018 barring any changes from Washington on corporate tax reform?\nAnd then just a couple of questions. ", ["Yeah. I'll take the first one on the tax rate. So, yes, I think your comment of barring anything coming out of Washington, we would expect that kind of a tax rate, that \u2013 before the stock option, it was about 14%. With the stock option expense rules and benefiting us, about 15% this year, I think that 12% is a good rate for this year and for 2018 barring any changes from the government.\nChristopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.\nYeah. Thanks, Derik. And just real quickly on Japan. As I said in the script, we had a very tough comparison year-over-year. One thing's interesting about Japan \u2013 and I actually just got back from Japan as well. Japan, a lot of the government purchasing, their final quarter is actually our first quarter. So, Q1 in Japan feels more like a Q4. And we had a huge comparison from a year ago, so we actually planned that type of a decline in the business, and the business met our expectations of what they delivered. And we're comfortable with the full year that we have shaping up for Japan. As you know, it's a very established mature business, very high rate of recurring revenue. We've got a very strong proven organization over there. And so, while it was not a grower in the quarter, it was about what we expected.\nAs it relates to CROs, they're a relatively small component of our spend. But certainly in the bioanalysis area, we are seeing positive trends from what I talked about earlier, which is the strength in our Tandem Quad portfolio; really seeing some encouraging wins in that segment now that we have the Xevo TQ-XS to complement to TQD and TQ-S micro. So, we like our product position there, and even though it's a small segment, we're encouraged by our performance.\nChristopher James O'Connell - Waters Corp.\nSo, thanks for the question. And I know we're coming up on time, so I want to thank everybody for the great questions, as always. And just to conclude, we are encouraged by our start to 2017, which is really headlined by our ability to deliver strong, organic top-line growth, some operating leverage and double-digit earnings per share growth. So, as we move into the mid part of 2017, we remain focused on delivering strong results and feel that market conditions and our strong competitive positions support continuing success.\nSo, on behalf of the entire management team at Waters, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q2 call, which we currently anticipate holding on July 25, 2017. Thank you, all, very much and have a great day."]], ["And if so, can you unpack for us what the sort of structural savings are that are now flowing through on a full year basis from the activities you pursued or sort of permanent benefits? ", ["Would be happy to. Let me frame all of this for you and then we're going to let Scott and Kevin weigh in on some of details. But we did have an exceptional quarter in terms of continued efficiencies across the business and there are a couple of factors that I think are important here. The first is that, during 2019, we saw essentially pretty much a full-year benefit of the implementation of our ERP system across the entire enterprise. So, that was helpful. And we're continuing -- as people get used to that new system, we're continuing to see efficiencies and benefits that we thought we would. And then compared to Q4 of a year ago, compared to Q4 of 2018 for example, there were there were significant O&M savings related to the closer of coal fired power plants. Remember in -- we've basically over the last several months, in year and a half or so, we've retired three old or less efficient coal fired power plants, units at Presque Isle, up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan where the latest to be retired in the spring of 2019. We have the Pulliam plant near Green Bay retired and we had Pleasant Prairie retired. So we're seeing -- in the fourth quarter we saw O&M benefits flow through from no longer having to incur O&M for the operation of those plants.\nThen we had some of our technology investments continue to kick in. And as Kevin said, we're projecting additional O&M savings that we think we're going to gain here. And we're on track to gain in 2020. So Scott, Kevin, anything you\u2019d like to add.\nKevin Fletcher\nYou already mentioned the ERP. If you look at common platforms across our system in the fourth quarter of this year, we will complete our customer information system to have that across all of our companies. We have already seen even this past year some savings from what we had in place already. But in addition to that, through last year and focusing on the future, just looking at process improvement, so as we look across like the jurisdictions, do benchmarking, we're looking at common standards and where it makes sense, so to have a proactive and the similar approaches across our system. That has produced some positive results for us on our O&M reduction, and it will continue to.\nGale Klappa\nScott?\nScott Lauber\nI don't think there is anything else. It is across the enterprise, though. Everyone has a O&M takeout, opportunities and efficiencies to gain.\nGale Klappa\nAnd we're doing that Greg, which I'm very pleased about and I thought we would be able to. We're doing that while increasing customer satisfaction. So that's one of the reasons I mentioned earlier in my remarks. As we tracked our operational and financial performance, we had a record year across virtually every meaningful measure of performance."]], ["But the point being, how sustainable are these given how outsized they appear to be relative to the balance, not just on a trailing basis but prospectively for \u201820 here as you think through the balance of your playing period. ", ["Well, I'll take a stab at that, certainly Scott can add anything he would like to and Kevin as well. But let me say this, we believe and I think our track record demonstrates that the kind of cost savings that you saw, that we continue to believe we're going to continue on a downward path, those are very sustainable. We wouldn't be publicly committing to them if we didn't think we could absolutely sustain them. So again, we took 7% of the day-to-day O&M out of the business in 2019, 2% to 3% projected reduction in 2020. And again, we're doing this I think in a very highly planned and deliberate way. And a good chunk of it is coming really from two areas. One we mentioned before that we're getting the full benefit of now, and that's the O&M takeout from the closure of less efficient coal-fired power plants. The other is the investment in technology. So my view guys would be highly sustainable.\nKevin Fletcher\nGale, I'd agree, we just mentioned a couple of things that we're doing, but let me add one more on the customer service side, though, we have and are investing in our AMI infrastructure and we've seen savings from having that in place to reduce the rolls of truck that will continue. And we'll see those opportunities ahead in the upcoming years. Also leveraging technology like mobile apps as an example, as we get that out into our customers we will be able to have more interaction with our customers and give them opportunities to pay their bills online, minimize paper billing, things of that nature. So I would agree that sustainability of that is built into a lot of what we're doing on customer service side, especially with the things that I just mentioned."]], ["So, I think for 2020, electric, you're forecasting down a little bit and if we go back to some of your EEI slides, there\u2019s supposed to be a tick up in the next couple years and more so as you get into \u201822, \u201823. ", ["Yes. Happy to, Michael. First of all, the uptick that we continue to project -- and it\u2019s a pretty slight uptick, the uptick that we're projecting in the 2022, 2023 timeframe is really driven by the amazing economic development projects that I talked about a little earlier in our remarks. We have not seen any slowdown in terms of the number of economic development projects, the amount of new construction, just the continuing economic growth or the pipeline of projects that are being announced here in Southeastern Wisconsin in particular. So, we still feel pretty confident about the uptick in the longer-term. The shorter-term meaning for 2020, is really driven by like for example, the large industrial segment. It's really driven by the interviews that our people have with our key account customers and feedback into our projections. It's also driven a bit by weather normalization. Remember, we had two warmer-than-normal summers back-to-back. So you look at weather normalization, you look at conservation, you look at real-time feedback from our major industrial customers and you put it all together and it's like it's in there, that's what comes out. So, in total, a very modest decline, I believe Scott one-half of 1% is what we're projecting on retail absent the mines.\nScott Lauber\nCorrect. So, a very modest decline. And once again, the projections that we have in the investor book are really the only projects that we know. It doesn't include the residential and secondary that we expect to come from it. It's just the known projects that have actually started turning curve already. So, it just takes a while to build a building and start using it. So, we expect those -- those are still on track to become. And like Gale said, our forecast is really out there talking to our customers and really fine-tuning it and the information we have, it\u2019s the best information we have.\nGale Klappa\nAnd we are still projecting -- even with the modest 0.5% decline, we're still projecting 6% to 7% EPS growth."]], ["And then, when we think about the tax appetite and you said that you would be small tax payer, how should we think about that taxpaying capacity in the '22, '24 timeframe? ", ["Well, when you still look and you work everything in, we would still be a small taxpayer getting into that, being in that frame of time if we execute on all these capital projects, largely because of some of the tax rules that are out there, you still have to be a minimal taxpayer for some of the reasons. But we need to execute on all these capital projects to get to that level.\nKevin Fletcher\nGiven the tax rules as Scott said, it\u2019s highly unlikely that we will ever in a sustained period of time get to absolute zero. So when we say modest taxpayer, for example, I think Scott mentioned $15 million to $20 million this year. So I hope that puts things in context for you."]], ["And then just finally, in terms of credit, and the holdco debt side, I think you started by saying you've got improving credit, and your holdco debt is now down to 28%. ", ["We\u2019ll let Scott answer that. We do have an internal an internal cap on where we want to go or where we don't want to go with holdco credit -- holdco debt.\nScott Lauber\nSo we look at that holdco, that holdco debt, it's down to 28%. Our target is to keep it below 30%. Now, if there's an opportunity, one year it may pop up or down, but -- and we feel comfortable of those ranges in our forecast here. And the FFO-to-debt in that 16 to 18 range. Now, last year, we had 18.5 but remember we were at in a sharing opportunity at Wisconsin utilities, that money will go back eventually to customers. So, next year may be on the lower end of that range, but still within that 16 to 18 range.\nGale Klappa\nAnd that range as you know, well supports our current credit ratings."]], ["The second question is, where do you stand on the permitting and regulatory approval for their gas LNG facility at Wisconsin that you talked about a couple of months ago or a while ago? ", ["All right, we'll be happy to try to take those up one by one. I think weather-normal, we were at 1.8 on retail gas. So we had a 1.8% growth in retail gas consumption on a weather-normal basis in 2019. You could probably go back in terms of when were we last below 1%. Whatever year that gas -- natural gas prices got to double-digits, I think we did not grow meaningfully at all in terms of natural gas demand from the retail side of the business. Scott?\nScott Lauber\nYes, exactly. When you think about it, yes, we've had 3% to 4% growth last year it was 1.8%. But now what we're really forecasting is really the customer growth aspect, not assuming any more conservation, but also assuming that people don't turn their houses from 69 to 74. People are going to stay comfortable. And we've also seen a lot of conversions the last couple of years from industrial for their own environmental goals to go convert from coal and oil to natural gas, so you only convert only once. So basically our forecast now is based on customer growth.\nGale Klappa\nAnd Michael on the LNG as far as the approval process, it's underway. And as I said in my prepared comments, we expect approval and we would begin construction in the summer of 2021 for operations in 2023."]], ["And I guess also I guess then the other thing, obviously, this is clearly part of strategies in terms of the income tax expense line in terms of the wind credits and everything like that. ", ["We can certainly give you the comparison of what we achieved in terms of the infrastructure segment earnings in 2019 versus our projection in 2020. As I mentioned earlier, the infrastructure segment gave us about $0.02 a share uptick in earnings each quarter during 2019. And with the addition of Coyote Ridge Wind Farm in South Dakota, which went commercial at the end of last year and will give us a full year this year, we would expect $0.03 a quarter from the infrastructure investments in wind.\nScott Lauber\nYes. And I think overall when you look at it, including the unprotected we're giving back in the credits to our customers, that effective tax rate is in that 16% to 17% range.\nGale Klappa\nAnd to clarify, what's going to be an incremental penny a quarter in 2020 in terms of the earnings."]], ["Just kind of looking at kind of the last step and if you look at LDCs or companies that are very heavy natural gas, their stocks have not done as well of lately and the multiples have come down.

At the right price, obviously, hitting the free that we've talked about for acquisitions, and we would always take a hard look. I would go because you recognized if you're making an acquisition of any kind of company, LDC or not, you are basically making a very long-term bet. Our assets, as you know, are very long-lived assets. So would, and I'm saying this just theoretically. If an LDC in the Northern North Dakota came up for sale at the right price, we probably would be a lot more interested in that than if it was in the San Diego."]], ["And then in terms of Foxconn, there's some local articles about the Foxconn administration, looking at renegotiating the tax benefits, because of I guess the way the Foxconn thing has been sort of rolling out.

I can tell you, again, I've said before focus on what's going on the campus rather than the media reports. But I can tell you, I was actually with the governor yesterday. He and I appeared together at an economic development conference here in Milwaukee. And he went out of his way to say that he believes his responsibility is to help make Foxconn successful in Wisconsin. So again, that's as of 9:30 yesterday morning and a very definitive comment from the governor himself."]], ["How do we sort of think about sort of incremental opportunities here especially since your generation CapEx looks like it modestly decreased in your new plan, and the governor's obviously can't afford this. ", ["I'll give you my take on it. We'll also ask Kevin to give you his view on this well. First of all, as you know, our generation planning really tracks what we think our capacity needs really are. So at the moment, we've got 200 megawatts of solar already approved. Then for our We Energies subsidiary, we just went in for another 100-megawatt approval, what we call Badger Hollow II, which should be immediately adjacent obviously to Badger Hollow I. So absent retirements of additional other generating capacity, that type of solar investment fits our capacity need, which is really, Kevin, a peaking right now. Now having said that, the governor has formed a task force related to trying to figure out what is the most cost-effective way to get to net zero-carbon generation by 2050. I'm pleased that the governor has asked our company to be a member of the task force. And we'll see where we'll go in terms of if there's any acceleration coming out of the task force. Kevin, any other thoughts?\nJoseph Fletcher\nGale, I'll just add, as you mentioned the governor has announced his plan and I've had an opportunity, and some of our folks, to talk about his plan. And I'll tell you he's comfortable with where we are and what we've laid out. As you said, we've retired, well, since 2014 about 40-plus percent of coal-fired plants. As you mentioned, the solar capacity meets our peaking needs for now. But we're starting to take a look at what our peers are doing as time moves on. But I feel good about where we're at and what we've announced so far.\nGale Klappa\nAmen."]], ["Any sort of thoughts or guidance on how we should think about the balance of your fleet as we look at sort of the generation transition, i.e., was sort of the securitization a one-off? ", ["Well, first of all, Shar, I guess, we read the reaction of the commission and the discussion of the commissioners. The securitization of $100 million of our remaining book balance at Pleasant Prairie, we read that all differently than what you may have read it. In fact my sense is, from their conversation and from the feedback we've gotten from staff that they thought this is a very positive solution that worked in this instance. I think that the -- perhaps the one note of caution that you might have picked up on is that I think everyone of the commissioners said publicly that these works, and this was a good solution for this particular situation, the retirement of that particular plant. But they were open to whether or not this is a template, and they weren't saying by being positive about this approach this time that it was necessarily a template. But I think, overall, in the settlement and the process I think was very well received by all of our stakeholders. In terms of going forward, we don't have any plan to retire any additional capacity in the next 12 months or during 2020. But obviously, we continue to look at our portfolio, look at the demand, look at economics, and see where we're at. But right now, for the next 1.5 years or so, we're going to be focused on getting that solar capacity in and operating well.\nJoseph Fletcher\nAnd I would just add to, that as we look at the decisions, moving forward on what the right generation mix is for us, as you mentioned in your comments, we don't have to look far back. In January, we had our polar vortex. We had extremely cold weather. And the balance of having a mix portfolio of generation, including the coal assets, was something that we needed to keep people's lives on and keep the gas flowing. So in addition to the economics and from a technological standpoint making the decisions, we'll balance that into our decision-making also as we move forward.\nGale Klappa\nYes, Kevin. And Shar, that's a great point. And truth of the matter is, if we haven't had the full array of capacity, solar, wind, natural gas, coal and nuclear, if we haven't had that full complement of capacity back at the end of January, it would have been a life-and-death situation. So there's nothing to fool around with. But obviously, we'll continue to refine our plans.

But frankly, the error margin or the margin of error in the weather normalization is pretty significant. So I think both Scott and I believe that the residential and commercial piece that looked a little bit weak is probably just because we didn't get the weather normalization right last year. The industrial, I talked about, you probably heard me say, it's down. I think we're in a pause.

Now we're showing 0.2 year-to-date. So we get -- average them together, it's right in that 1%. So I'm not really concerned.

So that's the law in the State of Wisconsin. It is a voluntary law. In other words, it can't be ordered. But it's a voluntary law. We actually supported the development and the vote on that law, oh my goodness, back about 15 years ago. So we thought it was a good tool for this instance. I think the commissioners in their public setting in their public discussion of our rate to review a couple of weeks ago agreed that for this particular case, this worked exceptionally well and benefited all of our constituents. But they also said, don't count on these being the full template going forward. And we certainly understand that. So I think there'll be a lot of discussions among all of the stakeholders and the commission staff going forward including, I suspect, the governor's office, because as you know he would like to get to a net zero-carbon by 2050. And that's going to require additional technology and retirements of existing units.

One, I mentioned continuing operating efficiency across our system. The second quarter of this year was really the first quarter, where we're seeing the full benefit of the retirement of our older, less efficient coal-fired power plants.\nRemember, over the course of the last year or so, we've retired three older coal-fired power plants, our Pleasant Prairie plant near the state line of \u2013 near Illinois, our Pulliam Plant near Green Bay, and the Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The closure of those three plants is delivering as we expected significant O&M cost reductions. So I think that was a big factor.\nThe second is, again we expected it. But we're seeing the benefit of our infrastructure investments that we've made and that was a $0.02 a share pickup compared to last year, as we roll in more of these infrastructure investments. So those I think were two very big factors. Scott?\nScott Lauber\nYes. And I think the third item, as sales were down a little bit. We saw the benefit in fuel by a $0.02 that came in a little bit better that offset. Remember the quarter was about $0.03 down compared to normal between the fuel and the O&M and infrastructure that all contributed to us getting above our original guidance.\nGale Klappa\nGreg, does that help?"]], ["You don't do them specifically for the earnings calls, but I'm looking at slide 10 of the July investor presentation where you talk about the Badger Hollow Solar Farm and the Two Creeks Solar Project.

So these basically the Badger Hollow investments, the Badger Hollow I just in the quarter, we got approval from the Wisconsin Public Service Commission to proceed with Badger Hollow I. That is capacity for Wisconsin Public Service in the Northern part of the state. And then as I mentioned on the call, we just filed a week ago for approval to invest in Badger Hollow II, which would be capacity for We Energies.\nIn essence, the WPS, Wisconsin Public Service investment would be about $260 million because that also includes the Two Creeks Solar Farm in the northeastern part of the state. So about $260 million of solar investment for Wisconsin Public Service. Kevin, about $130 million of investment for We Energies.\nKevin Fletcher\nThat's correct, Gale. As you said, the Badger Hollow and the Two Creeks were both for Wisconsin Public Service.\nGale Klappa\nAnd Greg, all of that was in our five-year plan."]], ["Well, I'm just going to pick it up where Shar left it off a little bit, but on the infrastructure side of the equation and admittedly this little bit of a blend.

These would strictly be storage for our retail gas customers. And Bluewater is a great example. Bluewater is actually delivering better customer savings than we even thought it would. So certainly we would be interested in procuring more gas storage, but it has to be gas storage that fits our need, it has to be gas storage that on which we can earn a predictable reasonable rate of return.\nBut again overall, we would like to own more gas storage. We'd love to get up to 65% or 70% of our expected retail customer peak demand to be able to be supplied out of storage, but slower she goes and we continue to look at various opportunities.

", ["We're chuckling because you probably heard me say this a gazillion times. I will say it again. The weather normalization techniques that are available to our industry are simply flawed. They're just not that accurate. And Scott mentioned during his prepared remarks, a huge \u2013 I mean a dramatic swing between in weather conditions, between Q2 of this year and Q2 of a year-ago. Scott, you just might want to repeat a couple of those stats.\nScott Lauber\nYes. So we are looking at for the month of June, it was the 10th coolest this last June in the last 70 years, and then 60% cooler compared to normal in the quarter. And the other thing that made it really challenging in Wisconsin here, it was extremely wet. So whenever you had a day that would get even above normal temperatures, it was cool. But even if you had a normal temperature, the next day you would expect the load to be there. It would rain and actually cool everything off.\nSo it's really hard to normalize when you have intermediate rains during the month and I think this is one of the wettest Junes we had on record. So that made it very challenging, but we are very happy when you still look at our customer growth. We're seeing about 0.7% growth in new customers or overall customer count year-over-year and both the gas a little bit higher in the electric and a little bit higher on the gas, so still seeing a good customer growth come through.\nGale Klappa\nIn fact to Scott's point, our customer growth, both on the electric and gas side of our businesses, it's actually a bit stronger in the first half of this year than it was even in the first half of last year. One other thought and actually Kevin and Scott and I were talking about this earlier today.\nWhen you look at particularly weather normalization for gas delivery, Q2 is just problematic to begin with because the volumes of gas deliveries are generally so low given that it's spring time and there's not a lot of heat required. I think we have to be very careful about putting too much stock in one quarter's weather normalization.\nNow longer-term and you asked a very good question. Longer-term, we have projected a bit of an uptick, particularly in electric demand in the 2021, 2022 timeframe and we're still quite confident of that because of all of these economic development projects that I mentioned earlier and more that I didn't have a chance to mention. I mean we have a very robust pipeline of industrial economic development and expansion projects that are coming on stream largely Scott in that 2021, 2022 timeframe.\nScott Lauber\nYes, exactly right, Gale. And we just took a look at it as we are preparing specifically in those outer years and just coming on our hands, we found about 14 projects that were significant size that's going to get us to the growth we projected when we were at EEI last fall.

", ["Greg, I think Kevin covered the three big drivers in the Wisconsin Electric rate case in his prepared remarks. Couple of things that might be responsive to your question, first of all in the Wisconsin Public Service rate case, part of the driver for that rate case is really two renewable projects. One is the acquisition of a portion of the Forward Wind Energy Center that Kevin mentioned.\nAnd then the other would be included in our rate case would be the investment in the two new solar projects that we covered during the prepared remarks, the Two Creeks in the Badger Hollow Solar Projects. That's a pretty sizable investment, Kevin that would be a part of our rate ask at Wisconsin Public Service.\nKevin Fletcher\nAnd the other one that I would add, Gale, which I mentioned is our SMRP project, the renewable project where we under grounding a couple of thousand miles of overhead distribution to underground, we'll be looking to put that into our rate base as well.\nScott Lauber\nIn addition, the low higher equity layer that we highlighted in there. That's about 1% and they've done it for other cases. And I'll just support our balance sheet better.\nGale Klappa\nRight. So we are asking for an increase in the upper end. We have a range now as you know for the equity layer, but the commission has approved, we're looking for a bit of an increase in the equity layer itself.

First of all, we have now for the first time in almost a decade and Wisconsin divided government.

And my suggestion to all of you would be kind of ignore the rhetoric and look precisely and what's happening on the ground.\nInterestingly enough, as I mentioned during our prepared remarks, Foxconn is moving forward. It is now clearly define what they want to accomplish over the next 18 months in Phase I of the projects. It's significant, including the addition of a major data center. And as you recall, there still standing by their longer-term projection of creating 13,000 jobs. But to put a finer point on it, we have been as you know very conservative in our projections.\nIf I don't think Scott had any significant ramp up in demand from the Foxconn campus until the last year of our five-year plan and we only had a very small amount of ripple effect, if you will \u2013 of additional economic development and additional jobs and additional demand.\nWhat we're seeing so far already as far surpassed in terms of the ripple effect what we have planned in our projections for the fifth year.

Now there's a few other items in net tax line for the settlement of the previous items and just some quarterly spreading that's required by the GAAP accounting that we planned in our forecast, but I think the key here is that $0.02 that we got that relates production to tax rate, that's about will get expect assuming normal wind."]], ["And then moving back to state politics a little bit, can you explain a little bit of the back and forth and sort of your expectations for what is to come around.

And if you recall, our acquisition of Integrys, which included the Peoples Gas Company, took place, I think we closed on June 29, 2015. So as the Commission looks at retrospectively the prudency of the program and how it was run, how the investment program was run in 2015, remember we have the company for six months, the prior management had the company for six months. And essentially what the Commission staff is saying is that they don't think the program was run as efficiently as it should have been certainly prior to the acquisition. And that's what the issue is. So we will work our way through that. I am not overly alarmed. It's just a matter of getting through this particular process. And this is an annual review, which is part of the regulatory compact there. So it's something we are very familiar with.

First of all, let me reemphasize that the economic growth we are seeing, yes, Foxconn is a significant piece of it but it's a lot more than Foxconn. When you see the growth in the corridor between Milwaukee and Chicago, it is significant, with or without Foxconn.

And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we should receive a Commission decision on the utility-scale solar projects that we have put in front of the Commission for approval. We expect a decision certainly by end of March or early April. Then as we have developed our internal plans, depending upon that approval and I am very optimistic about that, you could see us, as a next step, submitting a request for utility-scale solar for Wisconsin Electric as the one that's in front of the Commission today is for our Wisconsin Public Service subsidiary based in Green Bay.\nAnd then I mentioned, we just received approval for a couple of pilot programs that are pretty sizable and it could bring up to 185 megawatts of additional wind and solar to our regulated portfolio. So one step at a time. Wisconsin Public Service approval, up and coming. We trust then we are going to work hard on these two pilot projects that the Commission approved before the end of last year.

", ["Yeah, very good questions, Julien. Thank you. First of all, in terms of the return criteria that we're using, let me back up and say that, I view this whole infrastructure segment that we've introduced over the last 24 months really as a sign of how strong the company is. As you know, we're one of the few companies in the industry that does not have to issue equity to finance our growth, that has a tax appetite and we're seeing \u2013 because of just the backdrop in the industry I believe, we're seeing very, very good assets that we're able to take a look at and able to be very discerning in terms of the particular projects that we would actually bring into the segment.\nSo long story short, certainly cash returns, IRRs and ROEs are all an integral part of how we look at these projects. And I do see the projects when we talk about at or above our retail rate of return for these projects, we're really looking at an average return over the course of the life of the projects. So that's, I hope, answering one of your questions. In many cases, the returns are somewhat higher in the early years, but when we look at this, we're looking at consistent returns on average across the life of the assets.\nAnd then in terms of the projects that we already have basically underway, you remember last year, we closed on the Bluewater Natural Gas storage asset. And then this year, we added the Bishop Hill III, booked first at 80% ownership interest, now at 90% ownership interest, and we're also contractually committed to bring onboard next year after construction is complete the Upstream Wind Energy Center in Antelope County, Nebraska.\nSo in essence, one way to look at it is with Upstream coming on-stream next year, about 20% of the segment amount for the next five years is already in-house, if you will. And we have a number of projects in the pipeline that we're looking at. Some of which I think will come to fruition, but we have a very good robust pipeline of projects that we are taking a look at. Rest assured, we will be disciplined. And we're not going to do something that materially changes our risk profile and we're not going to do something that does not meet our return criteria. I hope that helps, Julien."]], ["And then secondly, I mean given all this opportunity that you have around investment, both on the regulated and the unregulated side, I guess the constraining factor must be the balance sheet and the credit.

And you remember the earnings sharing mechanism that we have in place with anything above our allowed retail rate of return. So, in essence, any outperformance that we would have in the fourth quarter of this year would basically be subject to the earnings sharing and therefore not flow through to our bottom line earnings per share report. So, you have to take into account where we were last year with earnings sharing and where we were this year. Scott?\nScott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.\nYeah. That's exactly it. So going into last year's fourth quarter, we were not into earnings sharing. And between fuel and weather, we gained about $0.09 and just started to get into that sharing mechanism of about $2 million. And like Gale said, we're near the top of that 50-50 band now. So the opportunity for additional $0.09 doesn't exist."]], ["Well, it's the same question every time because your demand growth numbers are clearly conservative, they have been for two, two and half, almost three years on the gas side, any thoughts on the fact that they maybe also conservative on the electric side as well?

And then we're also rebasing up just a hair our natural gas expectation for growth as well.\nScott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.\nThat's correct. And this last year across-the-board and every class we're seeing that natural gas. So having stable gas prices I don't \u2013 residential customer growth is good but still as appliances get replaced, they're just becoming more efficient. So, I just have a hard time seeing residential continue to grow at that same pace year-over-year other than new customers."]], ["Just along the lines of a previous question, the 10% of the CapEx budget being for the infrastructure segment, is that constrained at all by your statement that you won't issue equity?

So I think the reason we landed on this particular number for the Energy Infrastructure segment and the reason we ended up at 10% of our expected capital spend over the next five years with basically 20% of it already done, is \u2013 that's about the quality of the projects we're looking at.\nI think since we're being very disciplined and very risk-averse here, and we're not going to change our risk profile, that amount is about what I think we can spend in terms of the kind of projects we want to bring in-house. So it's really constrained more by our disciplined approach, by our return criteria than it is, I think, Scott, by any type of financial constraint.\nScott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.\nNo. If opportunities came, we'd have room to even do more than that 5% to 7% without issuing any equity. So it's not the financial, it's more of the opportunities to make sure we're realistic in the expectations to achieve our returns."]], ["And so what I'm wondering is, I understand that on average over time that's what it would be, but it sounds like some of it might be frontend loaded, and so I wanted to get more of a sense as to how that might be distributed?

The projects we're talking about really are in many cases either solar or wind or gas storage or some type of renewables. Particularly with the wind, you have a very heavy tax credit influence in the early years. Scott?\nScott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.\nYeah. So, specifically, the two projects we've had so far on the wind side, production tax credits are in the first 10 years, so the returns are north of that 10% by a couple of percentage points in that first 10-year period along with good cash returns because of the bonus depreciation. So it's really that first 10 years when you have the production tax credits that really make it a little higher on average."]], ["It strikes me that these returns look very good and that may be in part to a competitive advantage you have, because you\u2019re one of the few utility holding companies left with tax appetite, the table to actually transact on wind farms and consume those attributes, but then you also just articulated a slight move out and when you\u2019re a cash taxpayer, so can you just frame up why this is a good opportunity for you and you\u2019ve scoped it as sort of 8% of your total capital over the current five-year plan. ", ["Yes, good question, Greg. I appreciate, you\u2019re asking. I mean, first of all, you may recall when we rolled out our new five-year capital plan late last fall, right before EEI Conference, we introduced this energy infrastructure category and we put about $900 million into that category out of an $11.8 billion total capital budget.\nSo, yes, it\u2019s roughly 8%, 9% of our total capital spending. Since then and given some of the impacts of tax reform given the fact that other companies in the industry are finding themselves in a position to sell assets, I think we do have a competitive advantage. I mean, first of all, our balance sheet is strong. We don\u2019t have to issue equity to finance this $11.8 billion capital plan, and we do have the tax appetite.\nSo when you look at the whole array of opportunities that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace, actually Greg, the opportunities that we\u2019re seeing two of which we\u2019ve obviously just announced in the last couple of months, the opportunities that we\u2019re seeing to basically acquire high-quality assets that don\u2019t change our risk profile, those opportunities are greater than we thought they would be back last fall.\nAgain, it\u2019s a small percentage of our total capital budget when we roll out the new five-year plan this fall, I \u2013 if I were a betting man, I would think we would increase that the amount devoted to that particular segment a bit, but again keeping all this in perspective, we\u2019re being opportunistic with good high-quality assets here, but the driver, I mean, this is a great opportunistic situation for us, but the driver is still core investment in our regulated businesses. I hope that helps, Greg."]], ["And my second question is just with regard to the evolution of the Foxconn, the Foxconn project, you guys in your last sort of formal update said, you thought that would be a $10 billion project and create 13,000 direct jobs and about 22,000 indirect jobs throughout the state.\nBut when I talked to analysts who focus 100% of their time on the semiconductor industry, like there\u2019s just \u2013 there\u2019s a debate there as to what type of facility actually gets built, whether it\u2019s a facility that is a gen 6 fab or a gen 10 fab. ", ["Yes, good, great questions, Greg. Let me answer it two ways. I mean, obviously, we\u2019ve been very involved in this project personally, and within the last two weeks in a meeting with the Foxconn senior people, they strongly reiterated their commitment to a $10 billion investment and the hiring of 13,000 jobs.\nThey also, when President Trump came for the groundbreaking ceremony on June 28, they made a public commitment to a $10 billion investment and 13,000 jobs with the President standing right there. So what they\u2019re saying is that, the mix of products that they\u2019re thinking of producing here changes as their assessment of the marketplace changes.\nSo they may build something here different than their original projections at least that\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us. But in terms of their ultimate commitment of a $10 billion investment and 13,000 jobs, that remains staunchly unchanged and remains firmly in place.\nAnd when you see the hundreds of millions of dollars that are already being spent and the gigantic amount of earth that\u2019s already being moved, I think, it brings all that to reality, right?"]], ["So perhaps just to turn to the more regulatory side of things, can you discuss a little bit how the legislative mechanism passed in terms of settlements kind of changes your process in terms of the next rate case? ", ["I appreciate the question. And I think I would answer that in two ways for you Julien. First of all, it really does not change our fundamental approach to a rate filing or to discussions about a rate settlement. What I think the legislation does do is makes it easier and clearer for the Commission to accept a non-unanimous settlement, and that\u2019s the real key here in that legislation.\nThere was some debate when we went through the last rate settlement, as you recall, which we\u2019re now in a rate freeze going on four years. There was some debate about whether or not the Public Service Commission had the statutory authority to vote on and approve a settlement that was not completely unanimous among all the parties.\nThis legislation that was passed makes it clear that they can vote on and can decide on a settlement that is not joined by every single party. So I think that\u2019s the big difference that the legislation has enabled."]], ["So wanted to get a little bit more perspective on what\u2019s driving that?\nAnd secondly, does that \u2013 is that a sustainable kind of growth level that would give you more headroom to kind of increase CapEx? ", ["Well, it\u2019s a great question. And it has been one of the positive upside surprises for us. Really, over the last three years, if you look at and we try to weather normalize, but you\u2019ve heard me say before, there are real deficiencies in how our industry weather normalizes sales.\nSo I\u2019m always reluctant to talk about one quarter of weather normalized data. But we now have 2.5 years of weather normalized data, which is showing real continued growth in gas deliveries and customer use of natural gas. I think, Scott, we were up like three 3.7% and then another 3.7%, so you talk about 2016 and 2017 being about 3.7% increases on a weather nornmal basis. And then as you\u2019ve heard Scott and me say, we had a robust growth in weather normalized demand in the first-half of this year.\nSo, it\u2019s very hard to tell whether or not that trend will continue, but clearly the trend has exceeded our expectations. And when you look at \u2013 and Scott and I really delve into this in great detail the other day. When you look at \u2013 to try to answer the question, what is driving this demand for natural gas beyond our expectations. And it\u2019s not just one sector, it\u2019s like every sector we looked at was green. Every sector we looked at was showing significant increases.\nSo that combined with customer growth, we\u2019re serving about 15,000 natural gas customers more than what we were serving at this time a year ago. So I don\u2019t want to be overly optimistic here. But what we\u2019ve seen for the last basically, 10 quarters, certainly would indicate that there\u2019s some other trend going on here, which we haven\u2019t seen before, driving natural gas usage higher.\nNow what that means for capital spending? Obviously, we will take a hard look as we always do as we roll out our new five-year plan, and you may see some modest increase in capital spending on the gas side simply because of the infrastructure needs. And, for example, we\u2019ve already applied to the Wisconsin Commission for two projects, that would strengthen the natural gas delivery network in the Racine area, where Foxconn is and many others are now beginning project work.\nWe simply don\u2019t have a strong enough natural gas delivery network to handle all that demand in that part of the state. So there\u2019s another $140 million of capital already that was not in our previous forecast. I hope that\u2019s a long answer to your question. I hope it helps."]], ["And the reason for the question is, I\u2019m just trying to figure out the FFO to debt kind of trajectory impact of that change and how are you filling that gap?

So we\u2019re still at that 16 FFO to debt or a little bit north of that. So if we find other projects to have additional tax savings that would just increase us or put us higher in the FFO range.\nGale Klappa\nThat \u2013 that\u2019s the net effect of additional projects.\nScott Lauber\nYes.\nGale Klappa\nIt raises basically from, say, 16, it raises a bit higher, which is a good thing.\nScott Lauber\nIf we can get some additional tax bonus depreciation projects?\nGale Klappa\nRight."]], ["So on the \u2013 just a couple of numbers questions that we wanted to chase down the other income line where you talked about the lower non-service overhead cost and it\u2019s affecting both years.

And unfortunately, some of these items are being reclass between O&M and this other line, so I guess, really confusing in. And when we manage the business, we really look at both of them together.\nSo last quarter what also goes through here is a couple of items that swing between quarters like we have an investment in some deferred funds out there like it\u2019s a rabbi trust for some deferred comp and that also fluctuates between quarters.\nBut year-to-date, this is \u2013 the reclass of this non-service cost for the pension was the biggest number about $10 million on a year-to-date basis. So there\u2019s a variety of items that go both ways, including some miscellaneous interest income and the deferral related to our forward wind farm.\nWhen we put that into the rates in Wisconsin, we were allowed to defer a few of those costs to offset and unfortunately, that goes in this line also. So there\u2019s a mixture of stuff in there, but this was the biggest item for the quarter and for the year-to-date that really came out."]], ["And to follow-up on Jonathan Arnold\u2019s question about all those cumulative accounting noise issues and pension or OPEB, et cetera, if I looked at the release and everything correctly, I think, it was about $0.06, I think, at least, for this quarter if I\u2019m \u2013 if that\u2019s correct, that was a positive benefit.

When you look at that and when we really factored all that is \u2013 all that in, we were really looking at that as part of our O&M expenses and really consolidating it altogether. So the offset, when you do the math, it looks like O&M expenses is not down as far as you think and that\u2019s because some of these reclasses. So I really look at them together and I think together you have a good picture of where we are, we give the guidance and being down about 3% to 4%.\nGale Klappa\nYes, I think, Scott is right.

And, first of all, we have, as you probably saw when you look through the basic description of our capital plan over the next five years, the $11.8 billion capital plan that we're projecting for the next five years, we have a segment in there that we basically call energy infrastructure. And we put that in there frankly because we are beginning to see some opportunities, if you will, for the potential purchase of assets that some other companies are divesting, but they are good assets, they are assets that don't change our risk profile and that's a very important point with us as you know. But they are assets that can add to earnings, that can help us deploy capital in a very good way, that don't add to rate pressure at the retail level in Wisconsin or anywhere else. And in this case, although I think we're under a confidentiality agreement on the exact name of the off-taker, there is a 10-year offtake with this particular upstream property with a A-rated publicly-traded company. So they take all of the offtake for the entire 10-year contract and, of course, it does qualify as I mentioned for 100% bonus depreciation and for the production tax credits.\nSo, we thought this was a really interesting opportunity for us. It's kind of the first major project that we're putting into that infrastructure category. I want to emphasize that well, it may be just a hair different than what we've done in the past. We are not going to change our risk profile by stretching for assets that don't fit the kind of return and risk adjusted returns that we've always tried to deliver. So, this may be the first of a number that you see in that category, but again the concept is taking advantage of some opportunities but not changing our risk profile. And down the road, we're going to need carbon-free energy as well. So I wouldn't rule out 10 or 15 years from now thinking about putting that asset in a rate base, but that's not the current thinking. The current thinking is that this is a solid asset without ever entering into a rate base in Wisconsin.

So, whether that's a fully contracted midstream pipe or whether that's a fully contracted wind farm or whether that's an investment with a customer that we would invest in solar or a gas storage.

Now, if some great opportunities come earlier in the plan, that percentage may go up a little bit and then we'll work it back down like we have done in the past when there are opportunities exist.

If there's other opportunities out there we can take advantage of and get a return without changing the profile, we'll be looking at that.\nGale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.\nRight.

So, the answer's kind of mixed, yes, I think we've cranked in the electric demand and the capital associated with that.

We're going to have to see, first of all, whether tax reform actually gets completed and then what the real details are.\nAnd there's some thought that there might be an optional election on interest deductibility with a trade-off on another tax deduction item. We just have to see. At this point, I think anything that \u2013 I mean we're obviously looking at the landscape, but anything that I might tell you would be pure speculation until we really understand the details, I understand the House passed a budget today which raises the percentage possibility that tax reform will actually take place.

Again, I would say on that one, we can\u2019t sit here today and say I can't sit here today and say that the amount that we're spending and the people that we have is totally appropriate. And by the way, don't take that to mean it's too high. It's area-by-area. We've added a lot of resources. We need to understand whether we've added the right resources, whether we have people working together as well as we possibly can, understanding things that we've built manually to understand where we can go to automate those items, which will make us not only just far more efficient but far more effective.\nAnd so again, when I say it's really too early to be definitive about where we think about the level of expenses and what's appropriate, I put this into the same bucket. But again, I just want to be really clear about this. We don't sit here and believe that we have carte blanche to spend whatever we possibly want on any issue.

The big leg down in LIBOR obviously had a big impact in 2019 that's expected to be a little flatter at this point as we're looking into 2020.

That with a range of assumptions about loans and deposits probably gets us to down low-to-mid single digits in net interest income.

So, I guess the low single-digit growth rates for loans and deposits is probably a reasonable proxy for a reasonable placeholder for thinking about how 2020 unfolds, could be a range of different outcomes, but that would be consistent with what I mentioned earlier in terms of how you might forecast the different rate paths and getting to a low to mid single-digits down percentage in net interest income for 2020 versus 2019."]], ["Understood, thanks, and a follow-up on the fee side, we got the IRT coming out, did you spoke about it, was in the deck, and then you've got Estill [ph], can you just help us understand how you are thinking about how that just nets out as we get past this year as well in terms of revenue and expense trajectory?

Estill coming out starting in the fourth quarter, it was probably a little bit bigger in terms of dollars of revenue per quarter, and you'll see it mostly in the commercial mortgage brokerage line item in the P&L, it shows up in a couple of others areas too and have investment banking fees, but similarly the expenses approximate the revenue in our own experience. So when we finished Q4 and we talked about our 2019 expenses, and we will provide a reconciliation for people to be able to show where we ended up and we'll be sure that to call out both of those things.

As I understand it, I think our commitments for construction financing are actually up in the third quarter, which will come through as funded loans. That really is one market where\nthere's late cycle behavior. There's lots of non-bank competitors, there are more non-bank competitors than bank competitors. And so we really have to pick our spots in order to maintain our risk reward, credit and pricing and loan terms quality, and it's also one of those areas where, frankly, your weakest loans end up getting refinanced away from you, which is also late cycle behavior by the way, so we're still very comfortable with what we have on the books, but I wouldn't look for it to grow meaningfully until the cycle turns and until our best customers have really interesting opportunities to put their own capital to work and we help them do it.

And so, our teams have been selling into that and that's where we've been at the high point in the cycle for a while now. So with respect to the second part of your question, I expect that to reflect what kind of private market we're in and if it still is a strong and financing is accommodating it as it is today then I expect that that they'll continue to harvest and things will be good. It's a little bit harder of an environment for them to be putting capital to work because asset prices are so high. The other thing that contributes to is we had a change in accounting a year or so ago which is causing us to recognize unrealized gains where they said there's a subsequent capital raise in a private deal that causes us to have to mark up our position, and it's always been true if one of those companies goes public, but our affiliate still ends up owning shares for a period of time that we write up, we recognize the gain even though we haven't liquidated our position.

Let me start on that and I'll turn it out to John, I mean our conversation with our regulators are of course confidential supervisory information, but I can say that our engagement with the regulators has been very constructive and we're in constant dialogue with them on a number of fronts. As everybody recalls, several of the regulators made public statements earlier in the year in which they express their disappointment with the progress we've made up until that time. In response to that criticism, which of course we accepted over the last six months, we re-coupled our efforts with regard to trying to satisfy their expectations, and I made clear, I know Charlie will as well that the entire Wells Fargo team must continue to act assertively and decisively to meet the regulators expectations going forward.\nWith regard to the issues raised in the Fed consent order, the feedback that we are getting from the Fed on a constant basis is enabling us to continue to make progress in terms of responding to their expectations. We're a good ways down the road, but I think it's fair to say that we have a substantial amount of additional work to do and of course at the same time we've designed and implemented and we're constantly working -- doing enhance our new risk management framework, and that's fundamentally transforming how we manage risk every day throughout the organization in a way that I would describe as much more comprehensive integrated and consistent, and at the same time, we're enhancing frontline risk, independent risk management and the audit function. So that we can ensure multiple layers of review and better visibility into issues as they emerge, and obviously the goal of all this is to prevent the occurrence of the kinds of issues that we had in the past. And as John alluded to before, we're also emphasizing operational excellence throughout the company. Our biggest focus there is on business process management in an effort to try to deliver greater consistency.\nSo I guess what I will say, and I'll turn it over to John to talk about some of the financial impacts. There is a great deal of work to do to meet the expectations of our regulators. They're appropriately high, but we're committed to completing that work. We're working very hard and we're confident that we'll be able to complete the work in a manner that's timely and just as important up to the highest standards of professionalism and durability going forward.\nJohn Shrewsberry\nYes. And so, to the second part of your question, so we've had these efficiency programs in place for the last few years, which began before this biggest push in response to the Fed consent order and some other regulatory feedback, but through that process, we've got hundreds of programs that have gone activity-by-activity and said about taking unnecessary costs out, and then at the same time we've embarked on this getting it right from an operational risk, compliance, governance perspective, including all of the enabling technology, which is where all this money is being reinvested.\nSo, as I mentioned earlier on this call, the big opportunity once Wells Fargo both internally and from a regulatory perspective has chin the bar for being excellent at operational risk, compliance, and governance overall like that we believe that we are in credit risk and some other areas, is a massive simplification because as we go down this business process management path, we inventory and uncover the fact that we do just about everything we do in many different ways, and there is a huge opportunity to compress that to get more consistent. It improves the customer experience, the team member experience. It's easier to control. It's easier to automate, and it's much less expensive to deliver, and I think from an investor perspective, it's important to know that we are fixing our status quo Wells Fargo the way that our individual processes have currently operate and then there is the opportunity to re-engineer.\nNow that may look different after we have sat down and done a complete strategic review with Charlie, but it is how the team has set about doing the business or doing the remediation that's necessary to improve the company today starting with the way things are done today, but there is from my perspective an extraordinary efficiency opportunity in modernizing that."]], ["Okay, and then on the auto lending side, I know you highlighted that the reconfiguration, restructuring of that business is now finish, and we saw some really strong results this quarter with originations up. ", ["Yes, my sense is that if we still liked the risk reward, so if consumer credit stays about where it is and if used car value stay about where they are, that there is an opportunity for us to grow further. So as I mentioned, the growth that we have gotten so far is really by doing more in the same upper rationale on credit tiers, and we previously ran the business with -- including little bit more in the -- at least in the non-prime category, and my sense is that we will probably begin to do that too over the course of the next couple of quarters. We are easing into it, but I don't think of this uptick as aberrant, and I think that there is more to do."]], ["They haven't flown to the bottom line because you've had incremental investments in things like I believe risk management, regulatory compliance, operational risk.\nSo are you saying that in 2020, if you're assuming sort of relatively flattish expenses, any incremental cost saves will be offset by additional investments in these things? ", ["Saul, thank you for your question. Let me just start by saying that as you would expect, we're all very focused on our level of expenses, and we're doing everything we can to engage in vigorous risk management. We're going to continue to do that. As John alluded to, what we've seen is a greater need for us to make investments in terms of risk, compliance, and audit. All those things that we're going to need to make investments in, in order to satisfy the requirements of our regulators, but also, at the same time build the financial institution we know that that we can be.\nThose are our needs that in some cases are evolving over time and where we're making decisions about what incremental investments we need to make.

I think mortgages are going to be stronger as we roll forward, if you're just thinking about the major line items. I think trust and investment fees will be stronger, as a result of the recovery in the market. There is a quarterly lag that\u2019s built into that. On deposit service charges, we had a couple of things happen in the first quarter that were aberrant. I think, the run rate is higher than what we posted. We had data center outage that caused us to reverse fees for people for a period of time. There was a little bit of a government shutdown that caused us to reverse some fees for others et cetera. So, those are recurring.\nSo, as I go line item by line item, each one of them has its own story. I guess, I\u2019d point to mortgage probably as this year rolls through and given where the pipeline sits and the fact that we're up a little bit higher in terms of gain on sale, and servicing frankly feels a little bit more stable compared to Q4. We had some valuation adjustments. But, it\u2019s very likely that we'll continue to -- we always had a collection, we\u2019ve often had a collection of different types of gains from things that happen naturally in the business and from strategic decisions like selling some of these pre-crisis loans. And so, they\u2019ll be there too throughout the course of the year depending on decisions that we make. Whether they are core or noncore, it\u2019s in the eye of the beholder.

But, we do provide warehouse lines to people who deliver into Fannie and Freddie, just like we do also by correspondent loans into our own mortgage banking pool, which becomes part of our origination stats and part of our gain on sale. So, like a lot of these businesses, mortgage is one of them. The people with whom we compete who are outside of banking are customers of ours. We give them access to the capital markets. We finance them along the way. We understand the underlying loan. Sometimes, they're making loan where we are competing head to head, and sometimes they're making loans where we'd rather be in a credit-enhanced position on a pooled basis than be making the loans head to head. That's more of a commercial loan example.

And people ask from time-to-time, why do we consider that risky given that we've carried them at such a markdown rate. And unrelated to asset quality I make the point that those are loans that we would not originate today and as we go into the next cycle, they have more operational risk associated with them because defaults and foreclosures are going to be higher there and we just assumed to have less of them when the next cycle hits rather than morph."]], ["So, you're kind of derisking and you're getting the incremental balance sheet usage pushed out to free up capacity for that core, which just has a lower margin than some of these higher yielding portfolios had?

So with respect to different people's definition of core revenue, there will be, as we've talked about some of the fundamental line items that are relatively easy to track and how they perform through cycles, we also have a recurring -- different people will ascribe different levels of reliability to it, but different types of gain taking et cetera, that's -- or gain generation that you could add to the top of that depending on what the market is delivering to us.\nOn expenses, we\u2019ve reupped for this year. We've talked about the fact that in 2020, it\u2019s appropriate given the fact that a new CEO will be in and then importantly in that, return generation is our capital plan and getting the denominator down because we carry a lot of excess capital and I think that shareholders should hold us accountable for executing, for delivering and performing on our capital plan as well. So at this point in the cycle, where we are with rates, we're going to apply every lever within our risk framework for generating the right mix of loans and investing in the right mix of securities and non-interest income.\nWe're leaning hard in the areas where we generate trust and investment fees, deposit service charges as mortgage and certain market-sensitive categories in particular, and then frankly, most importantly, I think our shareholders will hold us accountable for the execution that Allen has described of moving the ball down the field against our regulatory commitments in 2019 and into 2020 as well, but those are very concrete steps that people can point to that will have outcomes attached to them."]], ["It's clearly been impacted by the account scandal, but there are a number of firms that have actually indicated very strong interest in growing, whether it's organically or inorganically, in this particular area.

So, it's not on the short list of things that we're talking about as we've been doing the noncore trimming here and there like retirement, for example most recently.

Let me just level set right, in that a lot of the dialogue that we have with the Fed is covered by a confidential supervisory information, so I want to be very careful in the feedback I\u2019m providing. But, I want to reiterate that we continue to have very frequent and constructive dialogue with the Fed, and we\u2019re both working towards the same goal, which is that we want to have best-in-class risk management period.\nAs you would recall, the consent order has two main topics. One is corporate governance. And the second is compliance and operational risk management. And each of these have multiple work streams behind them. The plans that we provided are very comprehensive, involve extensive documentation, which takes time to review and to process. So the feedback that we\u2019re getting from the Fed is very detailed and the outlook we\u2019re providing uses the best judgment that we have in terms of how long the process will take.\nBut at the same time, we\u2019re continuing to actively work and implement the new risk management framework, as I mentioned, we detailed that in our third quarter 10-Q and as well as incorporating the input that we\u2019re getting back from the Fed along the way. And from my perspective, we\u2019re making good progress. It\u2019s just taking a little bit longer than what we had originally anticipated.\nBut, to your second question, I think the fourth quarter results reinforce our ability particularly when you look at loan growth, and you net out the impact of the legacy loan portfolios for example, in Pick-a-Pay from the asset sales or the decline in pre 2009 home equity portfolio.\nBut when we factor that out, what you saw is our ability to serve our customers by providing them credit. You saw our deposit growth continue. And so our view is that we\u2019re going to be able to operate under the asset cap, meet and exceed the expectations of the Federal Reserve as it relates to our requirements under the asset cap and serve our customers, because again, we\u2019re in complete agreement with the Fed about what needs to be done and we\u2019re in the midst of implementing that.\nSo we\u2019re making progress.

", ["Yes. So it\u2019s -- it is the number that we have out there from our last Investor Day and we\u2019d probably update it again at our next Investor Day. So in the meantime, I think that\u2019s good guidance.\nAs we\u2019ve described in a couple of areas, at the margin that many of the things that we\u2019ve done in the last year have increased the average credit quality not that averages account for everything but have increased credit quality on the balance sheet, both in commercial and in consumer. We\u2019ve been operating in this 25 to 30 basis point range now for a while in terms of losses some of that is influenced by the fact that we have line items that have been in net recovery and so they don\u2019t really reflect what's going on with the loans \u2013 today\u2019s loans that are getting charged off.\nSo if you zeroed out net recovery, you probably end up a few basis points higher than the recent run rate. So I would stick with the guidance that we gave. Unfortunately also, we never actually through the cycle, right. We\u2019re either better than the average or we\u2019re worse than the average and we\u2019re either building maybe especially under seasonal building, building, building. And so our results will reflect that even if the charge offs are measured a little bit differently.\nBut I do think the next time that we update that guidance based on what that mix is in our portfolio and what the risk rating is in each of the categories, my sense is we\u2019re its safer overall portfolio than it was the last time we measured it and it\u2019s not unlikely that we\u2019d reflect that in the average, which we haven\u2019t updated it since last Investor Day.\nTim Sloan\nWell, a big driver of those results is it going to be \u2013 what\u2019s the cause of the downturn, right. And how deep a downturn we might experience. So some of it\u2019s a little bit beyond our control, but I sure would agree with John when you look at the quality of our loan portfolio today versus where we are five years ago and 10 years ago, it's markedly better."]], ["One is, John you referred to the level of over collateralization or haircuts a couple of times, can you -- on those loans to non-bank financial or whatever in that category of loans that you talked about that you\u2019ve given detail previously. ", ["It\u2019s a good question. So there\u2019s a variety of different underlying loans in those books of business, there\u2019s consumer, there\u2019s commercial, there\u2019s secured, there\u2019s unsecured, and each of them are structured to reflect what we think the lost content is of the underlying portfolio. So I want to \u2013 I\u2019m estimating though, I haven\u2019t looked that at all, but on average it would be call it 30% to 40% in terms of a haircut, and on average the credit quality of that portfolio would correspond to a to a single A or single A minus, our exposure.\nSo it\u2019s -- the loans there on their probability of default and loss given default terms are substantially higher credit quality than the average loan on our books overall. They do tend to be a little bit bigger and does a little bit more concentrated there, they\u2019re actively managed because there are loans going in and loans coming out etcetera, but as a result we\u2019ve taken these extra precautions. And that\u2019s how they would pencil out from an agency equivalency point of view.\nTim Sloan\nAnd Vivek, the other point I would make on that portfolio are a couple of other points. One, the under -- that their the exposure that we have is in industries that we\u2019re comfortable with. So we\u2019ve got experience, that\u2019s number one.\nNumber two to emphasize John\u2019s point, we\u2019ve got approval rights going in to the facilities and then kick out rights in many of the facilities on the way out if there\u2019s an underlying loan that we\u2019re concerned about. So, we look very comfortable with the underlying risk in that portfolio."]], ["The ROTCE target of 17% you\u2019ll have given any color on that, can you give us an update especially given where revenues have gone, given level of rates and yield curve and etcetera, etcetera.

It really helps them become much more efficient and effective senior housing operators and we are now talking this expertise and bringing it to health systems. Health systems are now working with us to figure out how they can build market share in certain markets that are important to them, and this is a tool that they\u2019ve really not had in their arsenal before.\nSo you know we see it as truly a differentiator and I\u2019d also say that our senior housing operators are also seeing the other capabilities we bring. You know I talked about the CareMore Anthem collaboration. That is a win-win for everyone involved, including the resident, their families, the operator. And from a senior housing operator standpoint, we see expanding the operating model of a senior housing facility by collaborating with third parties like a CareMore can drive occupancy and increase length of stay, and may offer opportunities to enhance revenues.\nSo we think that \u2013 you know we're always focused on alignment, that you hear that's a word other than optimism you hear from us a lot, which is alignment, and you know it's not just talk, it's real, it's happening, and that's what's driving the senior housing industry.

I mean to your point they're coming to work with us because of our \u2013 these capabilities, not of our cost of capital, right. Where there are significant chief sources of capital the world is divested with capital.\nThese are these capabilities, so you can \u2013 one way to think about it, you know you can think like how many of those operating partners that we may or may not be able to get over a period of time and then think about how are ongoing investment with them as I mentioned in 2019.\nEarlier in the year we sort of announced our batch of 2019 partners and so far you know today, as of today we have invested more with every one of them. So that sort of gives you a sense of \u2013 we\u2019ve been trying to get a sense of what the platform is what as Tom talks about.

It\u2019s very much laid out for that downside protection. It also significantly provides upside participation.\nIf you think about how we have moved away from \u2013 you know I'll give you another example, which is obviously it's very easy to think about senior housing, but just think about what we have done on our loan books, right, which essentially where cut in half. We don't make OpCo loans anymore, we don't make this kind of you know lending money to operators or lending money at the OpCo level, why is that?\nIt's because you know that downside protection will be that if you are a lender in a specific asset or box, you should be able to take over that box if things don't go right. We are a REIT, we\u2019re not allowed to own an OpCo right completely. So the fundamental you know idea behind this kind of loans are flawed, so we don't do that anymore.

Right. So this is not - I don't want you to think this is like an algorithmic trade that they get to a level for whatever reason, and then it's an automatic sort of action on our side. So that's not how the real world works. So it's an option that we kept to protect our shareholders.

Nick, essentially we have the right to bring them to the table. As Shankh said, it's not a gunpoint at their head, this - there is a structure around this investment that brings us to the table to work together to solve whatever bumps in the road may occur over a very long period investment. Historically, REIT set in positions where the operator could you show them the hand and where you have no ability to sit down at a table and work out a rational solution.\nI mean, we have no idea what the world is going to look like in 10 years or 15 years or in 20 years, but if you have a construct that aligns both the operator with the capital provider and allows you to sit down and make rational business decisions.

A Board - sitting on a Board, you're only as good as the information that is either publicly disclosed or provided to you by the management team and there is the role of Director, Michael, is not to run the company. It is there to protect the shareholder and your principal responsibility is corporate governance and to make sure that the right systems are in place at the company to protect the shareholder. It's very different when you cross the line to be part of management and you see things very differently.\nAnd I don't think you'd get a very different answer from anyone who transitioned from a Board seat to an operating role, and as I said earlier, it took some time to figure that out. And at the same time, I had a different view of what this business this company should be and I did not see us as a asset aggregator.\nAnd that was the strategy beforehand, when I asked the management team, what business are we in, they said we do deals and when you do deals, some of your deals are going to be good and I don't want to say that some of the deals, weren't good, but many of them were not good and again, the information you get as a Director is different than the information you see - sometimes, not in all cases - I'm not saying that about every company, but I will tell you I saw different things once I was inside the company, you have a very different look and a company structured as a Health Care REIT, for example should not be making private equity investments.\nThat is not our business and when you are paying, when you are seeing yourself as doing deals and your strategy is to show up at auctions and win the deals, you can wind up paying too much and you don't have the opportunity to insert the kind of rights that we know are important to a sustainable business model.

", ["So let me answer that because we've sold portfolios associated with operator relationships, you should assume there has been real estate inside those portfolios that we would have otherwise loved to hold on to, but that was not an option.\nSo in those portfolio sales, but I will answer the other question that if we had an operator with real estate that we loved, who was not willing to align with us around a construct that, as we've described, and only saw us as someone who could pay the most for their real estate, it's very likely we would part ways, we would not be - we would not be afraid to part ways because generally in markets around the country there are very attractive markets, we have more than one operator and so people might have thought we were exiting New England, when we exited Benchmark, but actually what we did is we aligned ourselves with a premium operator who is in the right markets in New England and we're hoping that we're going to have to growing business with LCB. We see them as the premium operator in the market and who is also much more Boston.\nSo that's an example, sometime - we're really, it's not - it's not a black and white decision and sometimes we are giving up good real estate, and we're not afraid to give up good real estate obviously at a price too. If we can sell - there is up hot market for high quality senior housing assets today and if they're not strategic for us, we pretty likely can redeploy that capital with a more strategic operator in a more strategic construct.\nShankh Mitra\nI'll just add one thing Rich to a pretty comprehensive answer Tom gave you, I don't want you to think that this is some sort of a - this construct only favorable to Welltower. There is a reason that we say the alignment thousand times, it helps our operators to make significantly more money than they otherwise do from other capital partner.\nThere is no one in this business at least to my knowledge, who pays more to their operators than Welltower. All we are trying to do is very simply, we rise together, we fall together. Our operators who perform have a significant opportunity to economically gain significantly more than what a standard operating agreement would be and thus that helps them to get better people and that obviously produce better results.\nSo it's a circular reference, if you will, but it's a virtuous cycle and not everybody will agree to that, but I don't want you to think some sort of this connotation as I hear this question, it feels like we just sort of have something that's only favorable to Welltower shareholders and it's sort of something against our operating partners, that cannot be farther from the truth.\nAlignment is not a one-sided relationship, whether that's to the operator or to the capital partners, it is very simply that you rise together and you fall together and many of our operators, who are confident in the ability to run this business over long-term are more than happy to do that and they can get paid significantly more, they are getting paid significantly more and the leadership of this organization are hiring the best people to deploy that capital and attract the best talent into their organization and hopefully, that sort of gives you a sense of how we do it.\nWe cut it so many ways, we have talked to you, so that this flows through the economy flows to the very bottom of this community, not just the leadership of this operating partners, but also people who are providing the services who our customers are seeing on a daily basis."]], ["And then on ProMedica, is there something helpful on a property level metric basis that you can offer up to us that sort of - give us a little bit of a better indication on the four wall EBITDAR coverage, or just property operating level metrics? ", ["We will only offer you what our partner is willing to offer to the marketplace. Needless to say that I understand your questions because majority of the investments that you have seen in the triple net side with operators that have no credit; or have seen significantly, was credit. As I pointed out that our view that our partner has significant credit, and I hope you understand that the lease sits at the top of the capital structure and not on a sort of SPE vehicle.\nSo, I do understand the question, but we want to be respectful to our operating partner and their desire to obviously have consistent numbers and message is out there. However, we give you enough, hopefully, on the cash flow side which tells how it's sort of - how things are going relative to what we talked."]], ["Maybe first on the Benchmark portfolio, if I just look at the run rate NOI last year, given just the number of assets, is it safe to say, or is my calculation correct that the cap rate is around a 5, and can you give us some context on Benchmark as it fits in with your data team? ", ["Vikram, we can\u2019t specifically give you a cap rate. I think you found NOI for all 48 assets, so safe to say that you have to think about a couple of things, right? You\u2019ve got the Q1 2018 NOI and you have to think about the growth o that NOI, whatever your assumptions are. We talked about that we sold the assets at a very significant gain, the impact of relative taxes, that will get you to a nominal cap rate, and then obviously the additional capex, whatever assumptions you have will get you go more of an economic cap rate or a cash flow view of how we look at it.\nSo we\u2019re not going to get into the details, but you are following the right track, and needless to say that we\u2019re extremely pleased with the assets. Obviously we\u2019re not looking to sell the assets. We got a price that we thought we can\u2019t refuse, so that\u2019s one thing; and second thing is we can sit here and debate, obviously, about cap rates, but I want you to look at the price per unit. That\u2019s not debatable, and that will tell you--and you can see what we bought these assets for, and that will give you a sense of how we feel about this, obviously the price.\nWe do think, as I said, that the price will--obviously this transaction is good for us, good for the buyer and good for Benchmark, so we do think that there\u2019s a great story all around. We also think obviously that the buyer who bought the assets will be able to generate the level of return that we think they have underwritten, otherwise we would not have signed off for that $50 million earn-out, so that sort of gives you a sense of the portfolio.\nFrom our perspective, you know that we don\u2019t look at markets, we look at micro markets, and obviously if you have very detailed granular micro markets, you can build a story of sub-markets in any great detail that you want to. We think about these issues deeply, we do think that this improves the quality of our portfolio. We also think the buyer that bought is a very sophisticated, very smart buyer. They\u2019ll also do very well. That it was not a strategic fit for us doesn\u2019t mean these assets are not strategic."]], ["Second question, building off of that, the Discovery portfolio, I was sort of intrigued - the per-unit costs in the 270 range seems to be lower than several deals we\u2019ve seen in the 350-plus range. ", ["Look, I\u2019m just not going to sit here and talk about transactions that other parties in the marketplace have done. I just pointed out simple facts that these assets have traded at a significantly lower price, 50, 60, 70% than different transactions, not just one. Price per unit, as I said, is not debatable, and I also pointed out that these assets are concrete and steel construction, I2 construction, so they are not stick-built assets so there is significant differentiation.\nFor certain of those transactions, what you might or might not know that we had the contractual right to buy those, the Discovery assets, and we passed on it purely because of price. So it is a question of difference, it doesn\u2019t mean some of those transactions are bad transactions, it\u2019s in our opinion we\u2019re just not willing to pay that kid of premium to replacement cost to buy assets in a market that it\u2019s relatively easier to build. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy to build, just relatively easier to build. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about this topic."]], ["If you look at your SHO development, you\u2019re up over $500 million and you\u2019re building a significant number of relationships on exclusivity on the development side that you announced this quarter. ", ["Absolutely not. It just purely depends on pricing. Let\u2019s take an example that we pointed out in great detail in the press release. With Discovery, we are buying as well as we are building. Obviously we understand development comes with a certain set of risks, so we need to make better returns that we otherwise would in an acquisition; however, we are very, very conscious of price per unit and price per foot, and we\u2019re seeing pricing in the marketplace that doesn\u2019t make any sense to us relative to what we can do on the build. That\u2019s the decision - it\u2019s not one versus another, it is a cascade of decisions, do we want to be in this location, who do we want to be in this location with, and then it\u2019s a question of do we buy it, do we build it, do we buy recently opened buildings? There\u2019s a lot of product that has been built in \u201915, \u201916, \u201917, \u201918, including by a lot of people who are not necessarily from this business, and they might have underestimated how difficult it is to run these communities.

We are squarely focused on several layers of the decision making process, right? You talked about age of the portfolio, obviously location is important as we said several times that market and sub-market does not tell you the story. You need to understand what micro markets you are in, what neighborhoods you are in, and how those neighborhoods are changing, then you can reconstruct the sub-markets and the markets back up. It\u2019s not the other way around. Those change, so you need to understand that.\nThe other layer that you need to think about is operating partner and the alignment of interest with the operating partner, so that\u2019s something we should have a conversation. Contracts are changing, and they are changing not in our favor. Contracts are changing for alignment of interest. We are not trying to do contracts that are just one-sided contracts. We are trying to do where we\u2019re aligned, right, so I want you to understand there\u2019s a series of decision making. Location is one, operator is one, the contract with the operator is another one, all going to the direction of we are in this, from our perspective, to make a great return for our shareholders and to enhance resident experience. That\u2019s [indiscernible].\nWe\u2019re happy to take that question offline and walk you through."]], ["I know you have talked about your focus on looking at capex for the portfolio, and it\u2019s kind of hard for us to see that other than if we look in the supp and you have the page on senior housing operating and you give your recurring capex, your other capex, and it looks like the per-unit recurring capex was up year-over-year in the second quarter. ", ["Let\u2019s take a step back and think about capex. Obviously capex will change as the portfolio construction is changing, right, so you\u2019re seeing that we are selling a lot of the older assets that will help capex. I also want to remind you that you have two non-repeating items in our capex - one is the vintage capex we talked about that is finally getting flushed through the system now, and the other, four assets we bought from S&H that we discussed is finally--those monies are being spent right now. I just want you to think about capex but in relationship with how the portfolio is changing.\nThe third piece as you think about capex is we talked about when we announced the Brookdale transition that we think these properties have significant upside and some of them will need to be refreshed, so that\u2019s also flowing through the numbers now. But there is no question, Nick, as we talked about, we are extremely focused on capex. We\u2019re focused on total return - capex is a very big part of that, and some of our portfolio decisions are made because of that.\nOn the other hand, I will tell you that on the medical office side, Keith and his team has done a tremendous job on the capex side and we are starting to see the benefit of that. So stay tuned, there\u2019s a lot to talk about this topic as we get through 2020 and beyond.\nTim McHugh\nAs you mentioned the full year outlook, Nick, we\u2019ve sold Benchmark so we have gotten rid of some senior housing operating assets, but we\u2019ve also added quite a few, and then on the transition side when we moved stuff from triple-net to SHO, the capex obviously flows through our numbers then, so that\u2019s a cause for some incremental pick-up in the guidance."]], ["For the acquisition of the newly developed Sunrise communities in DC, San Francisco and San Diego, I think in your prepared remarks, if I heard you right, you characterized these markets as high barriers to entry.

In Sunrise developments, we fund 34% of all development, so whatever the yield on cost on the development, a third stays with us, and that two-thirds that have rights on that we bought, so from an economics perspective I gave two numbers. For the two-thirds, the stabilized yield as we talked about is close to 6%, but I also said the overall stabilized yield for 100% of the portfolio is close to 7%. What\u2019s the difference? It\u2019s the third where the yield on cost obviously is very high.\nNow, that goes back to why the yield on cost is so high. If you do the math, you will see it\u2019s a big number.

Some of this goes back 10 years, 11 years, and it takes that much time, in some of these cases five, six, seven years to get through zoning, get through permitting to build these assets. So these two are very well connected, so obviously because of our ownership in Sunrise, and we talked about in other situations that we own up to 35% of different operators, what comes with it is an investment in those assets at a basis.\nNow, it takes time to build those assets, right, in these high barriers to entry markets because of zoning and permitting, but what you get at the other end is obviously spectacular assets at a great price, great yield, if that makes sense."]], ["I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re able to remind us again, or just give us a little more color around the nuances that make these particular markets high barrier to entry from your perspective.

Tim specifically mentioned 16 were removed for transition, the rest obviously we sold Benchmark, which is 48 assets.\nTo answer your question specifically, only when there\u2019s a change of operator, it moves from same store. If there\u2019s just a change of construct, it does not change the same store, so it\u2019s very easy to understand. The operating performance of a building doesn\u2019t change necessarily because fundamentally behind your systems, you have a triple-net construct or a ridia construct. When it does, when the management\u2019s changing, the flags are changing, it\u2019s massively disruptive for those properties. That\u2019s the source of our same store policy.\nWhen do they come back is the question you asked. When we own the properties at least for five quarters, so that you are not lapping easy comps. That does not create same store, so we\u2019ve got to own the properties for five quarters in the new construct, with the new operator for it to come back to the same store. That is true for our new acquisitions and for development that needs to be opened for X-amount of time, or they need to be stabilized for them to get to the same store.\nThe idea behind all of those is same store is supposed to give you a sense of how an average portfolio on a stabilized basis is doing. All these changes, including that if you move the assets out when you are not doing well, then you put the asset back in, obviously presumably when you stabilize it, that does not give you a sense of same store, hence the five quarters. Hopefully that answers your question."]], ["I suspect you look at that and think you can beat it, but maybe a different angle to the question is, is there an implied ceiling on your ability to move rate up simply because you\u2019re dealing with the elderly population and to milk every last penny from that perspective is somewhat politically incorrect, or something like that, so I\u2019m just wondering if there is some sort of ceiling to same store growth just because of the nature of the business that you\u2019re in. ", ["I\u2019m going to try to answer that question. We\u2019re not going to specifically get into a five-year outlook by another participant in the overall space. We gave you our own five-year outlook that explains our view of what we think the portfolio is going to be. You probably have noticed that the demand drivers are very easy to get your head wrapped around, right, and we think the same presentation you talked about has done a fantastic job of doing that, but you\u2019ll never hear us talk about a five-year outlook on a generic basis beyond what we know in our portfolio. Tim talked about on investor day of five-year outlook of our portfolio and how the lease-ups and all the construction in progress and everything flows together for a cash flow construct. Why that is the case despite the fact we have so many people whose sold job at Welltower is to do predictive analytics. Why we don\u2019t that, because we don\u2019t know the supply response. The demand side is relatively--not easy, but you can wrap your head around it. I can\u2019t tell you sitting here what the supply is going to look like five years from now.\nI will point out to you, not talking about any specific company, if you look at the history you will see the Welltower portfolio has outperformed in general the broad industry, as well as all other participants in the industry who own diversified portfolios. There is no reason that I would think that the future will be much different, especially in light of how we curated this portfolio in the last four years.\nTom DeRosa\nLet me just speak to your point about affordability. This is a business that is very high human touch, and that\u2019s why I made the comment about the hundreds of thousands of people that work in this industry. It is a very labor intensive business, and that explains the cost side of it and why the prices are high.\nI think the only way we\u2019re going to reduce the cost of a high touch, high labor component business is through technology, and that\u2019s something we\u2019re looking at. We don\u2019t think that broadly you can continue to charge a price that will compensate you for the high costs of delivering this product. You can in certain markets, and that comes back to our micro market approach because like there are people who will always want luxury products, there\u2019s always going to be a market of people that want--that demand that high service model, that\u2019s where we can deliver that.

I think we\u2019re a company, and with the support of our board we\u2019re constantly evaluating what are the skill sets that will be needed to run a business that would be different five years from now than it is today. So being able to recruit a very high caliber junior team of professionals all the way up to the NEO level is how you ensure good succession planning in a company.\nYou\u2019ve also seen us move people into different jobs here, and I think that\u2019s another key piece. I just talked about this last week at our board meeting. The idea that you always--when you change a job, you need to get a new title, really doesn\u2019t work. It works in some cases, but that should not be--that should be an exception versus a rule, and we\u2019re really looking at lateral promotions.

And our disposition of $1.4 billion that we revised this morning is all included into our 2019 number.\nJohn Goodey\nI would just add one more. If you think about it, we have raised the equity already. But as you know, real estate transaction takes time to close, right? You have a six month gap between when you are raising capital versus when you are deploying capital, which is the prudent thing to do. We are not going to take that kind of market with, we have big balance sheet to maintain.\nBut that is sort of driving the dilution this year, but sort of, you can refer from Tom's comments that we don't think, that impacts the run rate earnings growth. So you are going to see a good chunk of the run rate earnings growth shows up in the second half and then flows through 2020 and beyond."]], ["So how do you expect shop to perform in a recessionary environments since you are not protected by the least payments, but are instead exposed to premarket supply and demand fundamentals. ", ["Yes. So you are asking for something that we have absolutely no upside, either than predicting what might happen. I will just mention it to you that as you know our Senior Housing business, which is an e-driven business. Right.\nSo if you look at the Assisted Living data, over those timeframe you will see a business stage, lost a couple of 100 basis points of occupancy, but the rates growth remains resilient and expense growth is obviously helpful in that kind of environment.\nI'm not going to venture a guess of to exactly how things are going to play out. I will also mention to you that it depends on when you go into such an environment, what is the supply more importantly what the demand side looks like.\nSo it's a complicated answer than you would like, but I would like to point out when you think of our portfolio Senior Housing is a very broad term. When you think about our portfolio, think as you know it's a very much that particular portfolio and our idea says is very much the new driven product."]], ["And then I will just try to have one more, but looking at the capital stack you have $720 million of preferred sitting on the balance sheet at a 6.5% coupon that I believe are redeemable.

So even trading above that for some time, and there is a trigger on that that if the stock stays where as that or above that it will hit in the near future.\nI think the way you just think about that is that the way we manage our balance sheet is always to continue to position it, in a better long-term position, and we will be in the unique position if those remains convertible to not only further exercise the balance sheet, but do it in a cash flow accretive way.\nSo I don't want to speak to where the stock price may or may not be in the coming weeks, but you should think of us making the right long-term decision from a balance sheet perspective on this."]], ["So the main question I wanted to ask was to just touched on a couple minutes ago, but just to kind of ask on the same subject, anyway really as a follow-up on the overall pipeline.

One of the comments I will make is that as health systems start to see a future to their business model that is different from the very focused acute care model that drove so much of their real-estate investment in the past, I think that open-up opportunities for partners like Welltower.\nSo I would say what you see particularly from the non-profit health systems is a little bit of a mixed bag in terms of performance, because some of them are very well positioned to face a great new world, where data, new technologies and an ambulatory focus will have a big impact on profitability.\nThose that are attached to an acute care in patient bedded hospital models will struggle, not to say that there aren't markets where there is an undersupply of acute care.

Mark do you want to make a comment\u2026\nMark Shaver\nYes. Tom and Steve thanks for the question its Mark Shaver. I would maybe add two points. I think with health systems, we are going to continue to see two very important trends that we are positioned well to help with.\nOne is there are going to continue to need to right size their critical delivery systems, this is a lot of what Tom said. we continue to move away from the acute care and maybe some specialty care environment in the in-patient setting and build out there ambulatory outpatient and other sites of care footprint.\nSo we continue to be very active in those dialogues, and I think while their balance sheet is maybe strengthening a bit, the ability for them to fund that clinical growth on their own is going to continue to be challenged. That is a great opportunity for us.\nAnd then the second piece, which is really where I think your question was starting, there is going to continue to be vertical integration with health system partners, like you see across the health spectrum. And so that is going to create these ProMedica type transactions where they are looking to grow additional margin businesses.

", ["Sure. So, Steve, obviously, let\u2019s talk about, you have three questions and so we\u2019ll talk one at a time. First the pull change. If you look at, we don\u2019t talk about specific operators. We have a very strong same-store policy that you have to wait if there is an operator change, you have to wait for five quarters for assets to come in. Without getting into the specific details, I think there is some implication you guys think that we restructured another relationship and thus driving same-store. I would point out that if you go to the last quarter\u2019s call, Tim walked you through how the decline on those pulls that we have changed actually hurt our earnings. The second point I would point out that if you look at Page 3 of the supplemental, and look at the total occupancy growth of the cash SHO business, you will see there was a 100 basis points of occupancy increase while same-store is only 80. So that tells you it\u2019s a broad based strength we have seen and obviously it\u2019s a billion dollar for us. So, five x is going in and out really doesn\u2019t change the fact, but I am trying to look \u2013 point you to the Page 3 of the supplemental where you see that overall our shop business and you will there has been more increase relative to the same-store.\nAnd going back to 2019, supply question. This is a very broad topic and probably not suited for this call. We have a Investor Day coming up. We can tell you \u2013 we will have a very detailed discussion about this particular topic. I want to tell you how we see supply. It is just not market diverse supply we have a data science team that is very, very granular. We have build a metric called ACU which is adjusted composition units which is based on not only the number of supplies, but also the co-variants of different products, drive time, exponential detail of drive time and other machine learning algorithms into it. We have very specific view of how many of the new supply impacts us. Property we have shock factor. We will walk you through at the same-store all those details at our Investor Day. Needless to say that you are hearing that we are encouraged about the outlook. We are not necessarily saying and that we are calling for a bottom in any industry. But we are definitely encouraged by the outlook and we will have a broader discussion about this topic on our Investor Day."]], ["I think last year, you had a 0.8% increase year-over-year in expenses and that expenses sort of get easier, but can you just walk us through how you think about the structure today going into 2019? ", ["So, labor continues to be a headwind. I am glad that you actually know this that we had a very, very touch comp. Q3 of 2017, we had a 4.1% NOI increase on back of a very low expense comp. Obviously, the expense growth this year, it\u2019s not just a factor of expenses, but also a factor of what happened Q3 of last year and so that is absolutely the right observation. So that Mercedes will add some comments on how we think about expenses, but we think the headwind continues.\nMercedes Kerr\nWe both have talked about the initiatives that we have undertaken at Welltower to try to bring expense savings to our operators in work. Some are being down, some of those efforts I think pop up our mind right now is labor. It\u2019s something that is impacting a lot of industries naturally and certainly in seniors housing which is such a labor-intensive business. So, we are very focused on trying to bring efficiencies to our operators and trying to help them with our scale.\nShankh Mitra\nJust to add one point, I just want you to understand that the big part of the minimum wage increases have been flowing through our numbers. San Francisco went to $15 this year, that\u2019s flowing through the numbers. So, from here on, you will see more of inflation and increase. LA will hit $15 next summer. So you do have this, but I will say, looking at a more medium to long-term, a lot of the minimum wage $15 driven growth flow have been flowing through our numbers for the next four, five years. We feel encouraged about the long-term. But we are obviously, as you said, we are managing in the near term."]], ["And I guess, from your perspective, I am just curious, that sort of activity was already contemplated in your development plans when thinking about your focus on every markets in particular over the next several years. ", ["Thanks, Steve. I think that announcement related, clearly validates a thesis that we\u2019ve been articulating for a few years and have been at for a few years. I think there is demand for a next-generation of senior living product in major metro areas. You take a city like New York, which is made up of many villages that are densely populated that have an aging population. There is room for lots of senior housing property to be brought to this market. But I would say, it\u2019s a next-gen product. I don\u2019t see any of the product in a market like New York today being sufficient and meet the needs of the upper-end of this population. I am going to tell you I\u2019ve dealt with it myself personally. And there really are no options on the Island of Manhattan today. The first viable option will be what we were open in the end of 2019 early 2020 and on our Investor Day, you are actually going to have a chance to go into that building. It\u2019s coming out of the ground. So, in summary, Steve, I would say that we have a number of plans to bring that type of asset into the major metro centers. So, stay tuned."]], ["I am curious, I re-imagine it\u2019s going to come down a little bit by year end as a result of the sales you have teed up, but can you maybe just refresh us on sort of what leverage targets might look like as we look forward? ", ["Jordan, I\u2019ll start that and John can comment on the strategic side. The 598 that we printed this quarter, the debt-to-EBITDA can get a little skewed by timing of transactions. So I am glad you asked that, because we for 25 days at the quarter, we didn\u2019t have ProMedica as \u2013 or the entire QCP transaction, our cash flow. The way we present debt-to-EBITDA is an annualization of the quarter, since it's essentially a simple time for us. The 25 days of additional income we\u2019ll get on the fourth quarter bringing down that leverage, 0.17, comes down to 5.81 and then, the remaining $225 million of QCP non-yielding assets was essentially to the liquidation, right. There is no EBITDA on them. So it just can be cash. It\u2019s going to bring it down another 0.1 of a turn. So, our runrate leverage right now, it\u2019s reflected in our kind of 3Q earnings and then, the in fact three a little bit of drag from those non-yielding, I mean it\u2019s 5.71. So it\u2019s not as much of a gap when you think about \u2013 when we talked about kind of mid to 5.6 is being the pro forma leverage. We are almost there right now.\nProMedica income left in that transaction and we expect to keep.\nJohn Goodey\nYes, I was going to reinforce, Jordan that we are nearly or very close to where we said the pro forma would be when we announced the QCP acquisition. You heard in my prepared remarks, that overall, we see us capturing over time coming that levels generally in the order that we saw prior to the acquisition. I\u2019d know obviously, last quarter we were at 5.4 times leverage that gives you some guidance to what we conceptualize as sort of normal course."]], ["I mean, there is a difference in the risk profile, I think investors perceive a difference in risk between the operating and leasing nets, which we talk about some more offline.

There is 10 acres of land and are no assets that Mark mentioned we bought. So, there could be significant expansion of this relationship in those places as Hopkins figure out what their needs are. This is not just we are going to build a building. Right, we will build a building with our partner to meet that need. So, but, if you think about and I would encourage you, it\u2019s in your backyard, go and look at the land. You will realize this is a covered land play."]], ["Could you just talk a little bit about, I mean, a bunch of the pure play would be guys actually pulling back on acquisitions, but you guys are seem to finding some really good opportunities. ", ["Yes, so, this is, Keith Konkoli speaking. And I will just, I guess, reiterate what I said earlier in my comments. We are really focused on looking for opportunities and to do more health system business. So, as we\u2019ve looked around the market and we\u2019ve evaluated what\u2019s available, and we look at the broader opportunity across all of the different spectrums of ways that we can help deliver care in a lower cost setting. We just \u2013 we believe that we found some unique situations that we believe will be accretive as we are \u2013 as we continue to look to grow our portfolio.\nShankh Mitra\nTayo, that is not any different from what we have seen in the senior housing business. If you go back, I\u2019ll not be surprised, if you ask the same question I think you asked me three, four years ago, right. We have a relationship-driven investment strategy and we are execute \u2013 obviously we are very well known to have executed that on the senior housing side and we are executing that on the medical housing sector.\nThomas DeRosa\nWe spend a lot more time in the offices of the leadership of the major health systems in the United States than we do trying to put ourselves in the way of properties that are being auctioned off by different brokers. We are generating new business opportunities for our shareholders by knowing the needs of the health system and connecting the other assets that we are traditionally have expertise in like seniors housing and post-acute to their broader healthcare delivery networks. That is our unique investments thesis that this quarter, you should see some indication that that investment thesis is working.\nKeith Konkoli\nYes, and just to follow-up on that. When I was with Duke, we really we were a singly focused medical office in which the division that I was responsible for and we didn\u2019t have a lot of synergies across the business between the industrial space and the medical office space. The real opportunity herein, what really excites me about this business is we have those synergies that enable us to really be able to serve our clients in a very, very effective way."]], ["And I guess I'm struck by the fact that there's, I guess, yet another -- I don't know if the scenario was a default or some event that caused the restructuring here. ", ["Yes. So if you think about it, we talked about Brandywine. You are correct that Brandywine is actually, that real estate is the highest-quality real estate in our portfolio. I talked about how the NOI per unit, if you look at it, is $29,000-plus with a REVPOR of $7,500-plus is literally the highest in our portfolio. So you're correct about, absolutely, the view of the real estate as well as operating metrics. But as I mentioned, that deal was struck from day one, it was over-leased and overleveraged. And we absolutely have been talking to Brandywine for a long time about conversion from debt to equity. This was the right time we found because we think about it, you can -- not just a Brandywine conversation, you can imagine that we absolutely are getting excited about where we are in the cycle. Business cycles are different from supply cycles and need-based product like assisted living. So while I'm not going to tell you that I believe that we're exactly at the bottom, we believe we're close to the bottom. We're bouncing along the bottom. So that's when you get equity exposure, not debt exposure, right? So we absolutely -- we think this is the right time. We're not trying to time it quarter-to-quarter.\nMercedes Kerr\nYes, well, this is a conversation, by the way, that we've been having with Brandywine for quite some time. This is a very precious business to them, and they were really considering all of the options. They recognize this was not a -- I think you asked if this was a default. This was not that kind of a conversation. It was a conversation about optimizing our relationship and the opportunity for growth together. It was about connecting the capital structure of that business in a way that really will drive growth. And so it's not a -- from that perspective, I think we see this as a great opportunity, and Brandywine is going to be a great partner."]], ["I mean, I think we all look to your guys' leadership and your voices and guidance on this topic because I think it is important and it is a little bit uncharted territory.

This 85-plus demographic starts to increase at a rapid pace starting in about 18 months, is when you'll see the beginning of that.

", ["Yes, sure, certainly. So I mean, warehousing the $400 million doesn't unfortunately give us any upside from an earnings point of view, only downside because these are not income-generating assets. We're just bridging the ownership of that. You're right, that if we were to hold on that line and the TLB, we would have a small pickup. And genuinely, it's quite small when your LIBOR's obviously expended quite a bit. And we're sitting at 82.5 on the line and 90 on the TLB. So there is a spread that's not as much as you'd think. So we've built into the $4.025 midpoint a refinancing of those through the various actions that we believe we need to take.\nMoving the earnings up was because, a, we have the announcement of closing and we were ready -- essentially ready to announce our earnings for the quarter, it seemed a bit discoordinated to have a closure of the QCP and ProMedica joint venture, update our guidance, because remember, we promised you once we closed and we knew the impact on 2018 full year, we'd give you guidance. So we'd end up giving you guidance a week before giving you our financials, and that's always fraught with danger. So we thought the best thing was accelerate it, were QCP to close before earnings, would have otherwise been released. So it gives us the opportunity to access the markets as we see fit. Again, I come back to my statement. We are expected to be judicious when we raise capital, and we've given ourselves a long window, technically, to be able to refinance the short-term borrowings. So as we see attractiveness in the various markets we can access, then we will do so. But the moving earnings up wasn't that we were anticipating doing something tomorrow, as an example. It was just to do that.\nShankh Mitra\nAnd Michael, I will just add that as we have told you, the equity portion of the ProMedica-QCP deal will come from disposition, and our assumption continued to be -- continued to remain so. So that's how we'll be thinking about it and will continue to think about it. We're not anticipating common equity to fund that deal."]], ["So when I'm kind of listing to this call, it occurs to me, there's a lot of whack-the-mole type stuff going on here to kind of fix problems created by the REITs themselves. ", ["Rich, that's a great question. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we believe that we're towards the very end of that restructuring phase. So we wanted to talk about -- Tom mentioned the last quarter's call, and the call before, that we see 2019 onwards and earnings growth, cash flow growth, NAV growth. So we wanted to obviously accelerate a lot of these things this year so that we're not looking back. So as I mentioned and alluded to in my prepared remarks, we feel we're largely done. Just remember that from -- but your question was based on any large relationship were largely done? We're active asset manager. There will always be something that we'll look at and think about what is the right structure. But the crust of your question, we -- absolutely, we think we're largely done."]], ["And a new -- and anyone who comes in to replace that person is going to play sort of the least, the lowest acuity level until they kind of need more sort of care. ", ["John has me in a headlock here. So it's chomping at the bit to answer your question.\nJohn Goodey\nIt's a good question, Rich. I mean, mostly as in assisted living, you're charging, if you like, for room and board and care. And obviously, on average, people move in at a lower care need than when they move out because a lot of our move-outs were obviously, unfortunately, RIPs. But when you've got thousands and thousands of units, obviously, statistics apply. So on average, you are sort of at the average point. So we do look at -- and I noted down the question here. What is the re-leasing spread on the unit? On the room? Because if there is a supply issue in the market, sometimes, there will be a room rate discount, a transient room rate discount, to induce someone to come in. But I don't believe any of our operators ever discount care. I mean, would you want to be on discount care if someone was looking after you? I know I wouldn't be. So people don't discount care. So there's a sort of a two-part equation to the revenue that a room generates. But we do watch those statistics quite carefully because they're a bit of a diagnostic about how that individual building in that individual market, how that leasing is going. So you can look beyond just what is \"occupancy\". But on average, of course, as a senior leaves a building, they leave behind on a higher revenue stream than a new senior moving in mostly because of care. Again, you're talking about thousands and thousands of units from a statistical averaging point of view.\nShankh Mitra\nI'll just say that if you think about a cap rate or a multiple question, it's a functional IRR. It's an output, not an input, right? So if you think about an IRR is driven by growth, so think about that compares to a multifamily, is it's a higher-margin business. At the same growth rate, multifamily probably should have a higher multiple. But when the growth rate changes, that if you solve for the same IRR and lower downside as you are thinking, I mean, look at where we are in the -- at the bottom of the cycle and compare that where multifamily was at the bottom of the cycle. So you build IRR, at the growth part of that IRR cycle, you will get a lower cap rate or higher multiple. So there is not specific question, it's just where you are in that life cycle of a product."]], ["So I was just hoping you could talk us through the pecking order of investment opportunities, where you'd like to invest incremental dollars across the different property types and kind of cap rates as you see them today. ", ["Yes. So Juan, when I talked about dramatically changing the investment philosophy, I don't -- that's -- I was not thinking about product types. We're agnostic of product, that we would buy anything that makes money on a risk-adjusted return basis for our shareholders. So from a product perspective, there is no -- absolutely no change. The change in the investment process is one where we're focused on total return, we're focused on per share growth, not just the balance sheet growth. We're focused on IRR. So we're a total return based investor. We're not just focused on what the cap rate investors -- or frankly speaking, from the go-go days of expanding balance sheet investor. That's what I intend to mean."]], ["And just lastly, just fundamentally speaking, from the seniors housing perspective, I know you guys don't want to get into '19 and when exactly we'll trough, but hoping you could just maybe lay out the bull and bear case as we think about kind of medium term growth in seniors housing.

So it's very hard to say quarter-to-quarter. We do believe that we're seeing in the numbers that a lot of the markets that went into the supply cycle first is coming now. And we'll see where it lands. I mean, obviously, there's a law of large numbers on supply, but there's also large numbers on the expenses. They have been going up for five-plus percent CAGR for a long time. So we'll see where it already land together. It's very hard to comment where it will be exactly, but if we didn't think that we are at the bottom, then we will not have made some of the portfolio changes that we have made.\nMercedes Kerr\nYes. And I would add two more things. First, I think I talked a little bit earlier about absorption, which continues to, frankly, be quite strong. And we think that some of the trends in the pipeline are going to be helpful if there's a slowing down, if you will, of new starts. So absorption should be taking hold, and I think that, that's going to be helpful. But then separately, I would also say that we really study this, and some of our comments are really, I think, from a perspective that is very individual for a portfolio as opposed to sort of the generalized metric that you might get from NIC, for example. You probably already know that we do a lot of work that is very individual in terms of just serving our markets. We look at new supply and study what the impacts of new supply might be on a very, very particular base as these are proprietary type of tools that have been created by our business insights team. So that's really what we're -- where we're coming from when we look at this, the comments that you've heard here today about the future."]], ["Shankh or maybe Tom, just sort of stepping back on your last call, you talk about sort of providing a rent cut and simultaneously doing an asset sale, the size obviously was not known, but at least I took it as being a fairly large chunk of the portfolio.

If you think about Genesis management has done an extraordinary job of bringing all its credit parties together, just not real estate owners, but all the credit parties together to get to a point of a sustainable capital structure, that's extremely important which we thought basically they're making progress. But they have really surprised us on the positive side for bringing $550 million -- $5 million of fresh capital into the business. So, that's something financially puts the Company in a position of strength going forward. But more importantly for our retained portfolio as you can see our portfolio now is obviously is a much smaller portfolio that is much more focused, it\u2019s PowerBack heavy and we see for us a long time as I mentioned and stabilization of cash flow in that portfolio.\nSo that's one of the other things have changed. So operating performance has changed, credit quality has changed. Now as you can imagine that as capital allocators we look at every asset in our portfolio on sale, right. So, we're looking at this asset quality that we owned, we know the coverage we know what the operating -- really the operating outlook for those buildings and we're thinking at these prices is a buy, is it a hold, is it a sell. And I don't know the answer to that question like every asset that Genesis assets are also for sale at the right price. We retain complete flexibility and are slightly going forward. I'm not going to tell you that we'll not sell further I'm not also going to tell you so those assets will not be sold. So that sort of the messaging is we change when information change when facts change. And Genesis today is drastically a different operator that it was 90 days ago.\nTom DeRosa\nAnd Vik, let me add to that that we always look to enhance optionality in terms of how we manage this business and the strongest statement I can make to you is because Genesis is a dramatically stronger credit based on this restructuring going forward it means that Welltower is a stronger credit going forward."]], ["So, today's news doesn't sound exactly like you're recommitting to the skilled nursing business or to Genesis per se, but it does sound at the margin that you are willing to hold today rather than be a seller at an excessive discount.

So, with our credit significantly improved at the property level from a coverage perspective, as I also said the most important thing is the, EBITDARM coverage of above 1.7, and remember, management fee subordinate to the rent payment, right, and it is guaranteed by the corporate. So at every level you look at it, the three levels of stratification is materially improved.\nSo, I want to reemphasize that point, and I also want to reemphasize the point the rent reset that I talked about. So, if you look at the demographics and negative supply, if you believe in the demographics and you believe that nothing is going to change from a utilization perspective, there's going to be crisscross of demand and supply, not too -- in a not too distant future. And we'll be able to recoup that $35 million of rent as I said.\nWill we invest in Genesis going forward? We are, already are. If you look at, we have a PowerBack development, that's in progress and we believe in that model, so if there're other opportunities to invest in that PowerBack hub and spoke model that Genesis drives its business from, we'd be happy to do that, that's no change from what we have done.\nTom DeRosa\nJordan, you've heard me say consistently that we are not going to abandon this sector. Why do I say that because when you interact with the leaders of healthcare in this country, which are the CEOs that run the major regional health systems, they all say, they need a viable post-acute care option. The problems that the REIT sector has been dealing with were capital structures that were not sustainable given some of the changes that occurred in reimbursement.\nAnd as Shankh said and I say a lot, you can continue to kick the can down the road, until you just keep kicking the can at the wall and it keeps coming back at you. What we've announced last night and what we've -- are talking to about this morning is a fix that needed to happen years ago, but the industry kicked the can down the road. We have fixed the Genesis' capital structure, not just Welltower, it was every one of their capital partners, and we brought in a new capital partner.\nI think that says something about the future of Genesis, so we are in the business of maintaining and enhancing optionality. Optionality for where we deploy capital in the best interest of our shareholders. And so, nothing has changed, you've heard me say this, consistently, and I took a lot of stones and arrows for saying it. But I think our strategy will prove out to have been in the best interest of our shareholders."]], ["What is the total loan forgiveness that you either recognized in 4Q and that you expect to recognize in '18 of the $400 million plus or so that you've got to Genesis, you had to Genesis? ", ["Jordan, I'll answer the first part of the question, the answer is zero. We have not forgiven loans. We have reserved against those loans. So there is a significant difference in that and that you know and two hidden in your question is, something that I saw a lot of confusion about, if you go back and look at our financials for the last two quarters and see what we said our entire Genesis loan book was in payment in kind, we gave them as they were doing the whole restructuring for last few months. We did not go through a part cash, part payment today. We went from a complete pick to a part cash tactic payment today. And with that, I will pass it over to John.\nJohn Goodey\nAnd so I think on the penny front, Tim's got the answer for you on the actual pennies recognized in FFO from Genesis loan.\nTim McHugh\nSo part of that answer is and this is important to know this on a few notes this morning, we are just recognizing cash interest on Genesis in 2018. So in our FFO guidance, this morning is just the cash and as noted in both Genesis' release and that's prior to this, there was no -- these loans picked from 11/15 to the November 15th of last year through February 15th of this year. So if you look at the full year of 2018 important to note from January 1st to February 15th it was all pick and we did not recognize that through FFO. That's roughly a penny on a cash basis income that if you went full year for recognition we would have recognized and then for the rest of the year the pick component represents about five pennies that we have not recognizing through FFO. What we are recognizing is about $20 million of interest income in our 2018 numbers."]], ["Okay so on the forgiveness piece, did -- I guess I'm confused because I'm reading the piece about the bridge loans, the 275, they have you want them to repay no less Genesis can do to make progress they've to pay no less than a $105 million of obligations. ", ["As part of the announced restructuring for both Genesis and ourselves this morning is a commitment based upon contingency of having a financing partner step up in that $105 million of refinancing. The remaining piece is assumed to be outstanding for the rest of 2018. That 170 will be current cash paying, it is current cash paying right now because after February 15th, it went back to cash paying. And the assumption in our model is that $105 million is paid back around midyear and the remaining piece of that real estate loan and the term loan remain outstanding for all 2018 and are cash paying.\nJohn Goodey\nI don't think I'll just reiterate, Jordan, what Shankh said. We have not forgiven them loans we have taken a reserve again because some of this is collateralized that we have to test the collaterals that's underneath the orders as you can imagine make us do that. And that was the reserve that we have to take relates to the collateral, not to a write down of the loan, but Genesis will therefore be forgiven. So, there is big difference to Shankh that we've not forgiven the 60 million write down."]], ["You see if the change in view in Genesis so much the improvement of credit, but also the improvements at the property level, I think you mentioned that a little bit in your comment.

It is important to understand they are refocusing on the core markets, core markets where Genesis always has done very well. In our retained portfolio, which is as I said is very power back heavy we\u2019re seeing cash flow stabilization after long-term and we believe that if you think about how this plays out that we will be able to grow cash flow in the future.\nSo that\u2019s one of the points and credit is obviously very self explanatory if you can look at the coverage and you look at the EBITDA coverage and EBITDA coverage, that significantly improve above market coverage and the corporate guarantee is extremely important here, which is today with the Genesis -- if we look at the Genesis debt to EBITDA got almost that in half, that definitely an improvement in the credit.

Second, we absolutely did not think they'll be able to get fresh capital of the size that they did from the entity that they did.

I would like you to see what happens in that time frame with Kindred and Humana, Welsh, Carson.\nYou can see today what happened with you know obviously fresh injection of capital, I can talk about a lot of other things because they're non public in nature but things that are happening in the industry, so going back to way specifically to your question do we have the ability to do a transaction, absolutely. Did you get the price that we wanted, absolutely? Is that counter party still around for us to do a deal? The answer is absolutely. So the question is today as we are thinking about it at 134 coverage with a company that has leverage has been cut in half right, from the 7 to 3 is this group of assets we have culled a part of the portfolio you heard from John right, the 10% of the portfolio. At that price is this a buy sell or hold.\nThat's what we think about for every asset class. I share the enthusiasm of the market participants have about 4.5 cap asset classes that grows 2% but think about at the end of the day we are here as a capital allocator to make money, despite all the noise around Genesis our unlevered IRR is double digits. The math that I just mentioned which you know in low 4% mid 4% cap rate going in with a 2% growth with a 12% or 15% you know CapEx you will never even get to 7.

We have preference for best quality real estate in the best market run by best operator, and that wherever we find that opportunity, whether it's IL versus AL, we do not think about that any differently; it depends on that particular asset in the particular sub-market run by the particular operator and we think about a lot of -- sort of supply ways coming.

So, for CMS' initial estimates of the impact of the proposed rule to modest with changes in payments to for profits and freestanding facilities of minus 1.1% and minus 0.5%, respectively. So, this is yes at the high single digit cost of Medicare revenue that some are suggesting maybe significantly overstated.\nSecond, ACA, the skilled nursing industry's lobbying group has been involved in the design of this payment reform package with that several years with input from providers across the industry. So, CMS did not create this proposal in a vacuum. We've been hearing from several of our operators that the proposed rule contains provisions that will help operators deliver care more efficiently. For example the increase in the allowance for utilization of concurrent and group therapy seems like a positive, especially when you consider that in the context of our Genesis PowerBack properties which are highly rehab focused.\nFinally, the consensus on the pre-rule is that it's long way from implementation and there is going to be commenting on over the next several months of the year. An analogic credit is the revision to the long-term care regulation with CMS implemented in late 2016. Those were originally proposed in early 2015. So, that also has played out over about 18 months and further more operators had ample opportunity to provide commentary directly to CMS regarding that changes. So, we expect to see that play out similarly.\nAs it relates to our PowerBack portfolio, we believe that that is a -- has been a good investment for us and we continued to invest with Genesis. We have a construction start that began with them in the Philadelphia metro market, a PowerBack property and then one that's coming online in on the New Jersey side of their operations this year.\nTom DeRosa\nSo Juan, I think as Bryan stated, we're going to continue to look to invest in the next-generation of post-acute care assets whether that will be with Genesis or maybe there will be some other operators that are bringing this next-generation of post-acute care to the market. It is very clear to us, because of the amount of time we spend with the major academic and superregional health systems that this is an area that is keenly important to them, and so we are working with these health systems to try and refine the infrastructure that post-acute care can be delivered in effectively. It's always going to be a volatile space to be in and we want to make sure that we can continue to invest albeit never going to be a big piece of our business. But invest in a way that we will be getting an adequate return on the capital that we will deploy towards this space."]], ["Just one question on the senior housing side, we've heard that Holiday maybe looking to transition some of their independent living assets that are facing more supply -- sorry assisted living assets facing a supply to independent living.

Frequently conversations is based you know that are responsive to the market for example we might take some units in a building convert them to memory care. If we decide that there is a lot of demand that should be met and that we could get a nice return on that sort of conversion dollars that we invest in a property, things like that are happening frequently. But to have sort of whole clause changes when you are taking a portfolio and converting it from assisted living to independent is not a common -- I have not seen that happening in any widespread way at all.

So, if you go back and calculate quarter-after-quarter, we give you a three-mile, five-mile sort of radius and how it impacts our portfolio right?\nLet's just talk about a broader picture 5-mile. In Q3 of 2015, our total NOI that was impacted by supply was $83 million. That was the total. It peaked in Q2 of 2016 at about $90 million and today that is $73 million. So, I'm talking about just our portfolio. You saw a spike up and now it's coming down. So, you know we can sit here and talk about the NIC data and how that all relates to the whole industry. Obviously, you know we share enthusiasm for our sector, but we are particularly talking about how our portfolio which we think will do better.\nTim Lordan\nTayo, this is Tim Lordan. The only thing I would add to that is, one of the reasons we're optimistic about the balance of the year is, you know the rate growth in our portfolio, the rate of rate growth continues to exceed what we see in the NIC data and that rate growth has been there consistently. That's not something that's new for us this quarter.

We will build our medical office portfolio organically, which means that we're not sitting waiting for some big portfolio trade, not to say if one comes out, we won't be hanging around the hoop. But I will tell you that, we believe that the major health systems that we have aligned ourselves with across our business. We realize they cannot own all of their real estate for the long-term. You heard me talk about that 82% of this real estate is still owned by these health systems. They have significant capital needs for example in technology that will allow them to remain competitive. If they don't invest in technology and continue to sit there and think they need to own all of their real estate, they will become less and less relevant. So, we believe that we will mine medical office investments and development opportunities through the same way we've done it in the senior housing space, by picking our partners and being a trusted partner.\nI moderated a panel last month at a research conference, where I brought not only Chris Winkle from Sunrise assisted living, but also Mark Shaver who is head of Strategy for the Johns Hopkins health system. And actually Mark looked at the audience and said, I have to tell you, we own too much real estate and you know you haven't seen -- you probably haven't heard, someone at that level publicly state that. And basically said, and like you will see Tom owning some of our real estate at some point in the future. I think that's the way we're going to grow this business and it's important that their medical office footprint is going to be connected to our senior housing in post-acute care portfolio. That's the future of this company, that's why I am so excited about our business. I think this is one of the biggest opportunities that the real estate industry has seen in decades.

If you look at majority of the revenues are more of the products we introduced several years ago. And you think about NovaPure, which has been launched, but the uptake is significant. In fact, that\u2019s the other area of capacity expansion we have going on, both in U.S. and Europe to keep up with demand. So while the percentage is, let\u2019s say it\u2019s smaller, like, i.e., less than 10% of the high-value product portfolio, it\u2019s going to be much more meaningful over the next few years to come.\nSo, we\u2019re really confident of the runway we have ahead of us and the penetration of when we go from Envision all the way up to NovaPure, through what we see in the pipeline will only increase. And that\u2019s really all I can say at this point in time. We believe it\u2019s a double-digit growth portfolio, driven by the high-value products on the NovaPure, higher-end products of that portfolio, and it\u2019s going to be about 100-plus basis point volume expansion every year just to keep up with that demand."]], ["In terms of margin, you've been focused there, you've talked about certainly maybe starting with contract manufacturing, you've talked about kind of driving some more efficiency into staffing levels and things like that in the contract manufacturing business, the year-over-year kind of progression on margin slowed in the third quarter and I wondered, maybe starting with contract manufacturing, where there factors that kind of flattened that out, but then also in Proprietary Products were there mix differences from say second quarter or the first half that influenced the year-over-year expansion of margin? ", ["Yes. On the contract manufacturing, the margin expansion was a little bit slower than we would have expected in Q3 and we would have expected to see a little bit more and we have specific areas that we're targeting to improve the margin within contract manufacturing, so we have very focused groups working on that and so that is still a primary focus for us to make sure we start to see that margin expansion progressing through 2020, but it has been - in the third quarter, it was a little bit behind, where we would've expected it to be and we understand the reasoning behind us. It was regarding one or two of our facilities and the level of efficiency and productivity, we saw in those. So we have, as I said specific programs in place to tackle that.\nAnd on Proprietary, what we saw is from a standard margin perspective, we're pretty much in line with where we have been for most of the year or so, our mix is where we would expect it to be in the third quarter and we have a number of summer shutdowns, particularly in our European plants.\nSo the level of absorption that we get in the third quarter is normally a little bit lower than what we see in the first half of the year and that was primarily the impact on margin.

We think about the adoption rates with our clients, it takes one-to-two years to get the adoption and to have them retool their operations, which frankly, at the end of the day is taking cost out of their system, even though they\u2019re moving up the high-value products and ASPs slightly higher.\nSo we\u2019re supporting them by bringing better prior to the market, driving better yield of their manufacturing in final fill finish, and given the assurance that this total cost of ownership, cost continues to drive down their overall cost.

If you look at the NovaPure product portfolio that we've been talking about over the last couple of years, we've seeded the market. And it takes time to seed the market and get the expansion. I can tell you in the first quarter, the absolute dollar value of revenues is 2x, in NovaPure and you know where that fits in our portfolio of products it's the highest ASP and the most profitable.

We anticipate it to continue throughout maybe not as \u2013 it's by lower double digits in the second half, because of stronger comps.\nNow let me say that, we're still thinking about the margin expansion we do think it's sustainable. If you think about the thesis of \u2013 the high-value product portfolio while it's 60% of the revenues from a units perspective it's still about approximately 20% of the units. When we think about the pipeline of that we're feeding right now in the biologics and also the work we're doing with AccelTRA and generics in the opportunity for conversion over the next one or two years that's why we have confidence of continued healthy margin expansion to give us that 100-plus basis points of operating margins over long periods of time."]], ["I guess could you sort of talk about, just where we are in terms of the \u2013 the industry has sort of been plagued over the years by sort of recalls and quality issues and certainly in India, these other ones.

And we believe that anticipating very quickly. And the reason for that is because specifically towards ramping up in two particular areas, continuous glucose monitoring devices that we manufacture out of Arizona and out of Dublin. The demand from our customers is ramping little faster than we anticipated.\nAnd the second area is around injection device for the diabetes market, we\u2019ve also seen very nice expansion there.

We believe that particular market is growing, let\u2019s call it, mid-single digit. That\u2019s our expectations. But we\u2019re growing faster than that and it\u2019s because of what you indicated, as we are having some competitive takeovers and winning new contracts.\nThe two areas of that 90% \u2013 roughly 90%% of the business, above a little bit less than \u2013 about a half of it is really going into our Biologics customers. And give you an example, we are having ramp up I mean, injection device for the diabetes markets for one of our customers. And fortunately not just the Contract Manufacturing of the device, but we also participate with the NOVACHOICE plunger, which is a high value product for us in that particular that unit.\nThe other part of the growth that we are seeing \u2013 that we saw in Q2, really is a continuous glucose monitoring devices, and again, both from Arizona and Dublin. Our production we have to continue to ramp up or had been asked to produce more volume, because the demand is there. And that\u2019s very exciting. As we look forward Dana, we\u2019re looking at areas of adding new capabilities around cold chain storage, drug handling. This is also attracting new customers and new projects. So I believe some of the volatility we are going to have. On a positive side, we\u2019ll be to the new offerings that we\u2019re going to be offering in the marketplace."]], ["You mentioned just on the \u2013 just a few global questions, most of my questions have answered, but on the high value products sort of sustainable high-single, low-double digit growth, is it historically or up until today, it\u2019s been mostly driven by \u2013 on newly approved drugs. ", ["Yes, Larry, this \u2013 you\u2019re right in regards to new product pipeline, particularly in all three market units. We\u2019re focused on converting our customers and having focused on high value products as they go through the process for approval. But we\u2019re actually seeing good traction and conversion from standard to high value products. And in addition to that we are seeing, I don\u2019t use the word, upgrades to Westar and Envision upgrades than from the standard products.\nSo it\u2019s not just moving to the high value products, we\u2019re also seeing our customers move up the value curve, all the way up to NovaPure, and that is one of the elements that you see with that growth. Again, every time we are able to take our customer in the journey towards the ultimately the NovaPure offering, not just the ASP increased, but it\u2019s also the margins increased associated to that. So it\u2019s a combination of both, Larry."]], ["So first of all, underpinning your gross margin assumption for the current quarter, I'm just hoping that you can provide us with a little bit more granularity of how we should think about the trajectory of the hard disc drive gross margin given that that was relatively weak, I think versus expectations in this last quarter. ", ["Yeah. So Aaron, I'll address that and then Mike and Bob can add a little bit of color. In terms of HDD gross margins, if you go back historically, I know you're well familiar with us, Aaron, that we would normally expect our gross margins to be in the low kind of 30% range, say 31%, 32%. So we're operating below where we'd like to be. And we would expect that as we move through the balance of this year, and certainly into 2020, we would see our gross margins begin to move more back into that range. And so that's kind of our expectation from that standpoint.\nFlash, I would say that, will be similar performance, maybe slightly down to -- it kind of hard. But range, let's say roughly similar to where we're at right now, a lot of that's going to depend upon the pricing environment. And we're seeing a more stable pricing environment from what we've seen over the last several quarters. And we would expect that as we move through the balance of fiscal 2020, we will see an improving gross margin profile on our flash business as well.\nMike Cordano\nYeah. And Aaron, let me just add, and Bob mentioned this. So in our desktop category, so the so the drag in the quarter just reported is really we're in the midst of a product transition on desktop and surveillance. So that was a drag to HDD margin. And just to reiterate what Steve said, we expect to see trending up sequential HD margin in the back half of this year and beyond.\nSteve Milligan\nI\u2019d just add one thing. The other thing I mentioned is on the flash side, we are expecting improvement, but we do have a headwind of the K1 startup costs, which we saw some in the fourth quarter, will see again in the first quarter and throughout this fiscal year."]], ["And then just as a real quick follow-up on the flash business, I think, one of the notable things that differs in your results here tonight is kind of the capacity shipment number down 1% on a sequential basis. ", ["Yeah, so as I talked about in my script, Aaron, this has really impacted the mobile category. And it's both some impact to the geopolitical activity, but also some choices around business that we didn't see was favorable from a profitability standpoint or lower ASP. So the two of those drove the bit shipment delta on our side. And obviously, we think we've got more interesting places to spend our bits as we progress through the calendar year.\nMike Cordano\nYeah. And Aaron, I mean, you can -- you'll notice this as well, our sequential ASP decline in the flash area was meaningfully lower than other\u2019s reported numbers which there's a direct correlation in terms of that data point, and our participation in the mobile segment."]], ["You said there might have been about 100 million of lost sales here for the stoppage of shipments for a month, but as you resume shipments, it sounded like you're not doing that at your flow rate. ", ["Okay, on an overall basis, I think the way we look at end market growth, certainly we see strength in data center across both HDD and flash, as we get into the back half of the year. We think there's growth possibilities, both at the market level and specifically for us. We also see continued resilience and normal, cyclical demand flowing through the historical PC category. So we see that trend continuing to be good, both in terms of unit demand, but also in terms of capacity mix of that demand. And generally speaking, mobile is on a relative basis, stronger in the second half than it was in the first half. So I think that's the general theme. So we do see normal seasonality across markets that tend to behave that way. And then obviously, the data center is continuing to show robust capital spending expectations moving forward.\nMike Cordano\nYeah. And the relative the Huawei, we have resumed shipment, as we noted in the prepared remarks. But during the time when we see shipment to Huawei, they moved their sourcing requirements to some of our international competitors that were not impacted by the entity list and so when we subsequently resumed shipment, it was at a reduced rate that contemplated them, sourcing components from other competitors."]], ["And as in relation to that, I'm curious how we think about idling wafer capacity and going after receiving market share in certain areas, mobile, as we described earlier, when some of the South Korean peers appear to be going after share near term? ", ["Yeah. So I think one of the things to think about is we focus very carefully on relative capacity share. I think we remain in a quite competitive position. The short term decisions we\u2019ll make based upon sort of economic and current market conditions we see is more tertiary. Right. So ultimately, we were comfortable with the decision we made several quarters ago to run underutilized that brought us into the middle of the year with a better overall inventory position than we would have otherwise had. And ultimately, we're able to place our bets in a way that gives us a better overall economic outcome.\nMike Cordano\nYeah. And I would just -- to quibble a little bit with your choice of wording, I would not say that we seeded market share in the mobile market, we determine that at the prices that were in effect, it did not make economic sense to take that business. And so it was an economic decision that went into that as opposed to the seeding of market share."]], ["Can you help us understand assuming that the Kuala Lumpur facility closure kind of keeps a positive trend on gross margin and also coupled with the commentary of the demand for the high capacity drives.

So listen, the lowest -- all those factors are at play, but the principal one that occurred in the tail end of calendar 2018, if you remember, lots of components were on constrained supply, so DRAM Flash and even capacity enterprise.

So once the supply -- overall supply environment began to change, they took upon themselves to normalize inventory position. So, that was the primary driver. Yes.

", ["Well, let me give you a little bit. Let me answer your question. I'm going to broaden that question. So let's talk a little bit about how we see 2019 playing out. So let me talk about the top line first.\nSo we would expect that for next quarter our fiscal Q4 and I'm going to speaking relatively general terms, but this will help all of you. Our revenue levels to look pretty consistent with what we're expecting for fiscal Q3.\nGoing into the back half of the year we would expect that our revenues will begin to improve for two principal reasons: one, improvement in capacity enterprise volumes as our hyperscale customers return to more normal buying patterns and resumption of growth in terms of capacity enterprise.\nAnd then additionally, let's call it a seasonal bump in terms of our revenue kind of call it across the board both in terms of Flash as well as in other areas. So our revenue will begin to improve.\nNow I'm going to start your question on margin for the time being. I'm going to talk a little bit about OpEx. OpEx this quarter in terms of expectations, Mark touched on it is inflated beyond what it would normally be. It's an inflated -- it's inflated really because of a couple of different reasons.\nInflated compared to fiscal Q2, because one we've got FICA taxes that kick in this quarter that for a higher wage or people that will kind of go away as we move through the quarter. And then the other thing is that we had some variable comp, credits that were in the December quarter that will not reoccur in terms of in the March quarter.\nSo that's why that compared looks a little bit odd. When you then move to the balance of the year, one we've got operating expense actions that we will be taking that will \u2013 the full effect of that will be realized in September, but you will begin to see more of a benefit of that in the June quarter.\nSo OpEx will be trending down as we move through the year to a $740 million level starting the September quarter. After one complexity in the September quarter's we will have 14 weeks of operating expenses versus 13. So we all need to keep that in mind from a modeling perspective.\nFrom a margin perspective that is always difficult to determine. And it is really the wildcard. Clearly, from a Flash supply and demand perspective, which is consistent with what others have said, we expect that we're going to continue to be under pressure as we move through the first half of the year.\nThe second half is a little harder to say, but I'm going to tell you what we are assuming. It doesn't mean that it's going to happen, but I'll tell you what we're assuming is that we are assuming that margin pressure in the Flash area will persist through calendar 2019.\nNow we're doing that for really one principal purpose from a financial modeling perspective and that we want to have a conservative bias, so we're kind of - I'll call it planning for the worst that is leading us to the actions that we outlined from a cost and expense perspective in terms of either accelerating actions that we are already planned or taking new actions to take cost and expense out of our system.\nBut it's obviously not fully within our control to say how is Flash supply and demand going to play out as we move through the calendar year, because obviously we've got demand which there is a fair amount of fluidity and uncertainty associated with that right now. And then, we do not have \u2013 clearly, we don't have control nor do we have complete visibility in terms of the production level of our competitors.\nI know it's a long answer. What that will mean from an EPS perspective is that you \u2013 is that probably next quarter will look a lot like this quarter in terms of EPS performance. With some level of improvement as we move through the back half of the year with one exception in that we don't know how the 14-week can we make up for that 14th week of OpEx in the September quarter in other words can we get 14 weeks of sales. That's always a challenging thing that when we get 14 weeks.

Long - Western Digital Corp.\nYeah, so from a modeling standpoint, when you think about the HDD side, the capacity enterprise and client compute contribute to the decrease in revenue. And then on the flash side, we have the pricing environment reducing revenue as well as mobility declines. The margin changes are largely a function of the flash pricing environment and then the lower mix of capacity enterprise on the hard drive side."]], ["But as you think about these capacity reductions coming ahead, should we expect gross margins to compress beyond the December quarter here like at least for the next couple of quarters at this point? ", ["Well, it's a great question. And the reality is that, I'll be sort of literal, we don't know for sure. We're going to have to wait and see, but we would expect that we would continue to face a challenging flash market through the first half of calendar 2019. And so that implies that there could be further margin compression, but at what rate, we will have to see.\nBut we don't \u2013 these reductions that we're making from a wafer start perspective will not begin to hit just because of lead time for us until the first quarter of 2019. It will primarily allow us to reduce our inventory. And then, of course, we've got the demand environment that we're dealing with and whatever competitive dynamics we'll be dealing with. But we do expect the first half of 2019 to continue to be challenging for us and for the industry."]], ["I guess, in light of the wafer start change and delaying CapEx, would love to hear your thoughts on how you think about scale and other factors to enable best-of-breed cost-down in this highly competitive market.\nSo are there other avenues to lift that sort of low end of the range of 15% that you're focused on, perhaps pulling in 96-layer or above or faster move to QLC? ", ["Yeah. Relative to the cost declines, you're on the points. It's tech transition, so rate in which we convert to the next node, and the implementation of QLC over the longer horizon. That's a bigger lever.\nThe thing we are highlighting in our projections as of now is just the realities of the 3D era, right. They're more capital intensive and the cost declines are going to certainly be less than they were in the 2D era. So that's all part of how the market and the industry is having to plan differently.\nStephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.\nYeah. And we continue to \u2013 because of the joint venture structure and that, we continue to expect to benefit from scale despite the reduction in wafer starts, because it's only our capacity that we're reducing those wafer starts.\nBut if you look at the total output of the joint venture, we continue to have the broader benefit of scale semiconductor manufacturing operations."]], ["Inventories have been going up since earlier this year, and I'm just curious how you're thinking about the debt covenants, especially given your guide and your comment about the margin erosion. ", ["So, in terms of our covenants, through our refinancings and the optimization of our balance sheet earlier in this calendar year, we put ourselves in a good position to manage through volatility. And we remain in good standing with respect to our covenants. And our current forecast keeps us in a good position with respect to compliance.\nAs it relates to managing cash flow, we are looking at all the levers, as Steve pointed out. That's part of our overall review. We look at our manufacturing footprint. We look at how we manage working capital. We look at our OpEx levels, and we are constantly pushing to both manage our business as efficiently as we can with respect to the current market environment and then make sure that we are also investing in the right ways for what we see as some very good long-term opportunities and some very good growth potential on the capacity enterprise hard drive side and in the flash business.\nStephen D. Milligan - Western Digital Corp.\nYeah. And, Mehdi, just to add color to that, because I think it's important to emphasize, when we looked at the decision to cut capacity, not cut capacity, I mean, ultimately, what we were solving for was what did we think was a better answer from a cash perspective. And that action in and of itself, just as a for instance, provides us with a meaningful net cash positive. And so that is something that we are constantly looking at mechanisms to optimize not only on a short-term basis but on a long-term basis."]], ["Given what the share price has done recently plus your outlook to earnings, any changes to the way you think about capital deployment for your stock buyback or the early cadence of it or do you need to keep that cash a little more handy for your closing of Kuala Lumpur and your shifting in other business?

So investing in the business, our CapEx, and then we look at, of course, the dividend and our share repurchases. We had targeted $1.5 billion for repurchases in fiscal 2019, and as we said, we remain on track for that.\nSo there's really no change other than we do agree that, with the current share price, it is an attractive use of capital. And we will factor that into our balanced strategy going forward."]], ["I wanted to ask; I guess first on the guidance, I know the three-year outlook is calling for 2% to 3% growth in consumer, but any color just for next year in terms of how you think business solutions and maybe other revenue will shape up. ", ["Well, I can jump in, but let me start. Look in the fundamentals, nothing has changed. We really assume that our business will perform; especially our digital expansion will perform. The digital expansion for us is it branded or white labeling and Bill is going to go and that you saw the recent numbers on our \u2013 growth numbers are quite impressive and that's from a different base than the competitors have, right? We have been investing here for a long time and growing very strong in digital expansion, that continue to go.\nThe other part is that dropping money on real-time on accounts that will continue to grow. And offering retail cash payout and dropping money in real time. It's a huge competitive advantage within our capabilities. And look, we also started to drop money for businesses, right? I mean we are collecting for Amazon \u2013 from consumer in different countries, businesses. We are doing transactions for third parties and our business-to-business had a good year growing by 4%.\nSo generally I would say that nothing has changed from our Investors Day. We are in a good momentum. We like our business, we like how we are affirming, especially those are transformational activities and our efficiency activities are very promising. And we are still in targeted our 2022 goals. Anyone you want to add something?\nRaj Agrawal\nI think you've covered it. So I think we're good."]], ["I guess, can you give maybe a broader update on kind of what the pipeline looks like for those third parties and in particular maybe the Amazon partnership, any update there in terms of like plans for the year and market go live. ", ["Yes, I think it's as you said, it's a longer term. We started in a very good stronger digital growth; definitely our partnership helps on our strong growth, right? And look, we go-to-market, we are talking and in some countries we offering our dotcom business in some countries on our digital white labeling part, depending on our partner, depending on the legal environment, depending on the consumer relationship. But the good news is that the partners are choosing our capabilities to move cross border cross currency money. And that's \u2013 that capability having two countries and capable of operating in 200 countries is unique.\nAnd so, I mean, it's still small but growing very, very strong and has good potential and we will definitely update with additional partners. I mean, we recently signed three big postal offices like the La Banque Postale, UK Post and the Italy Post. Italy post is for instance having access to 7 million consumers \u2013 Italian consumers with their mobile phones, right. And they will go \u2013 they do transaction cross-border by using our platform. So it's quite impressive and we dropped money in real time for them.\nAnd that's going to continue. It depends really on the partnership how they choose, if they choose Western Union brand or being a partner like Amazon, which Amazon uses their own codes, we are referred them as service provider to collect money for their online services."]], ["should we think about that as sort of the feature and the balance of the business is really being a cash cow for lack of a better term and fueling investments to support digital and returning capital to shareholders. ", ["Yes. I think Andrew, as we laid out at Investor Day, our \u2013 we said that our assumption was for 2% to 3% overall growth over the next three years and that has not changed. And the composition of that was a flattish type retail business. obviously, we\u2019d like to get a little bit of growth out of it, but we do believe that can be the case. And then we expected digital to grow in the 20% range and off of a base of $600 million last year. That\u2019s quite a bit of contribution. And then we also expected and continue to expect that the B2B business will grow in the mid single-digit range. So, those are the components we\u2019re thinking about. Obviously, we want to drive to more than just 2% to 3% growth, that\u2019s not satisfactory, and that\u2019s where really our platform strategy comes into play and signing more and more partners as we move along.\nBut just last point on the domestic business, it was about 6% of our total revenues last year. So, it\u2019s becoming a smaller and smaller piece overall of the company, and that\u2019s probably a trend we\u2019re going to see for a little while, so \u2013 and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve assumed in our outlook for this year as well."]], ["I mean the -- you obviously call out a lot around the partnership model now and the ability to use your network for others STC and Sberbank is the notable ones.

", ["Yes. I think, Ramsey, good question actually. If you look at our business being in 20,000 corridor plus, we've been doing dynamic pricing all the time. We adjust the pricing. You heard several quarters before and for several years I was talking about suite [ph] corner pricing and other activities. This is what we have done here is that we really go through more corridors. We've multiple the corridors with some product adjustment and pricing adjustments. And also if you download your westernunion.com you will see also so you can choose between different channels when you send money to different countries with different channels. It's like an airliner. We were adapting the pricing to the customer needs, to the demands and that has been different -- definitely power.\nNow what we're doing is that we tested with artificial intelligence the certain corridors. We are really -- over the years, we will invest that because it's huge, right, 200 countries, different corridors, different needs and \u2013 but artificial intelligence is definitely something will give us power. The other thing is I mentioned again, the pricing environment generally has been stable. We\u2019ve been -- definitely, we have some competition, but we are products, our speed, our channels, our brand makes it, our compliance programs, our settlement programs, our platform makes it happen that our pricing environment is been -- has been stable."]], ["So I wanted to start with trying to get more of -- more granular information with regards to the segments in geographies if you don't mind kind of going to because I do see that there's some pretty good acceleration in the Middle East South Asia piece, which I'm thinking maybe this is because of things like Saudi Telecom that agreement. ", ["Yes. Just on Middle East, Africa and South Asia just to reiterate some of my commentary. We had strong growth in Saudi Arabia and UAE and then we had a slight offset from the hard currency issues in parts of Africa. But overall the market improved dramatically from a revenue standpoint, so 4% revenue growth, 5% constant currency. Saudi Arabia was driven by a couple of different \u2013 well, primarily driven by the performance of Saudi Telecom that had very strong performance both transactions and revenue. And then some price changes in certain corridors.\nAnd then UAE also had a good performance that was driven by some agent incentives and other things we're doing in the local area as well as some price changes. And then overall those transactions also improved. So Saudi Telecom I would say would be the number one highlight for the region. If you look at some other regions; Europe and CIS stayed relatively stable. Transactions improve there. That was largely driven by the Sberbank white-label business that we have which had high transaction goal [ph], less of an impact to the revenue side.\nNorth America was relatively stable to last time. Latin America was a little bit softer, but Latin America has been growing in the double digit range for quite a while, right? So we saw Ecuador and Chile growing well and that was largely business going to Columbia because of the migration patterns we're seeing from Venezuela to the neighboring countries. And then Asia Pacific, we are doing price reductions there. So that helps. The transactions trends a little bit. There's still negative. But it helps a little bit but revenue for that reason stayed about the same. So does that give you a little bit more color, Ashvin what you're looking for?"]], ["Is there anything else left in that process because you kind of look at the stub of the other revenue piece which by the way you guys continue to extract good EBITDA out of it.

So, things that fit within that strategy we like and we'll continue to own and we may look for other things that help to supplement our strategy there.\nAnd things that are not in that definitions or potential candidates who as to look at divesting but there is not much left. Really the only domestic payments business we really have left of any size is in Argentina.

They're going to move money anyway but in a hard way but if they use us, it will be easier way. And that's the incremental part of that revenue.\nOf course we will, look at that is the incremental opportunities we were going to invest this, but I don\u2019t assume that we will have a huge different investments which will affect our margins and we are very committed to our three years margin expansion.\nRaj Agrawal\nYes. The only thing I would just add is that as we had said Andrew on at Investor Day, we are saving, we're driving some more savings than just the $150 million by 2022.

If we think that in 200 countries and 137 currencies definitely it has something. I don\u2019t see additional risk because if you're opening your platform already to the banks, it's a kind of know your customer environment already done.\nBut our team is very diligent to choose the right partner, our team is very much investing to look what how we can move in a very compliant way worldwide and we are very dedicated.

Over the years, we created that cross-border engine, we call it cross-border platform which allows us to settle 137 currencies in minutes and turn that really, offer that really now, not only to Western Union customers which are the C2C customers, really offering also that to C2B and B2C customers.\nAnd that's where our platform is unique. Not everybody has that. We have 200 countries license. We have compliance programs which is driven by artificial intelligence. We have a technology, which is really unique.

With that, Amazon is only one example to go out of our C2C customer, really using that Turk brand, which is the Amazon app called and offering our platform to Amazon so that customers worldwide are able to shop Amazon online.\nAnd these are kind of things which I am trying to take the company to the next level. C2B, B2C and C2C is definitely something in our hearts. And other examples is, Jim you know, we talked a little bit, is the University pay. The student pay product is basically acquiring universities. And so people can globally pay their are fees locally and study in another country.\nAn example, there are about 200,000 Chinese students only in Spain. And so we can offer that. People pay in local currency and can study in Madrid or Barcelona immediately and get their visas to go abroad. So these kind of things are definitely something we are looking at. It's not only Western Union branded products, C2C product but also other verticals to offer our platform."]], ["Aside from the macro pressures you are seeing in a, the corridors, can you maybe talk about whether you think the bigger impact on some of the transaction deceleration you are seeing is more due to things like the hard currency shortages, et cetera?

But generally, I would say that our U.S. outbound business, which is a major business and European Union outbound like France and Germany has been doing very good, good results. Even in Saudi Arabia and UAE, we see some, if you put the pricing to that, some improvements in the recent quarters.\nI would say that the impact is really the U.S. domestic money transfer business has impact to our business from transaction wise. And we always say that our competency is in cross-border, cross currency and that's where we are focused and I feel resilient also. Even we don't see the pricing pressures.

I think that operating in 200 countries, serving more than 20,000 corridors, it's really a competitive advantage.\nRaj Agrawal\nI mean the remittance principal growth based on the World Bank data, Jim, is a little bit slower this year than it was the last couple of years.

They have a big migrant population and these people are also started to have credit cards and accounts which you can allow them to send money from their account, from their credit card directly to 200 countries, not giving cash to a location. We believe it's a huge opportunity. Going forward, it will take some time.\nWe know that the dotcom customers take some time until we acquire them but when once they start to use them, they use it more often than retail. So it's the basic. And you know, if you look at our growth rates, as I mentioned to Ashwin earlier, we have been growing around 20% constant over the years right now. And our base was much smaller on dotcom. Now our base over $0.5 billion revenue and we are still growing by 20%. That's a part of the global expansion and part of it is that returned customers on the existing countries."]], ["In the North America region, I see transactions accelerated in the quarter at least year-over-year from 1% to 2%, but constant current you see revenues went down a couple points, and then EU and CIS similar. ", ["This is Raj. In North America what you're seeing on the revenue side is, it's a growth over from higher foreign exchange spreads we had in the previous year fourth quarter, and some of those spreads were reversed during the course of the year. But transactions growth as you mentioned continue to accelerate, so that's good. Our U.S. outbound business actually did quite well. We had 7% transaction growth there which has been accelerating during the course of the year, but some of the pricing and mix impacts had the impact that we're referring to.\nAnd then the Europe and CIS, the dotcom business overall grew very well during the course of last year and in the fourth quarter and also our DMT business in France. So, those have some mix impacts. The slowdown in the fourth quarter is again related to higher FX spread that we had earlier in the year in those markets that we reverse part of those. So, transaction trends have been quite healthy and just some of our mix in pricing impacts are having the revenue impact that you're seeing there."]], ["Just when you go into the mix impacts, hey, on this C2C segment that drove the two points of difference between transaction growth and revenue growth and I think you've mentioned one point pricing. ", ["Darrin, the mix is something that we don't really try to forecast. It's difficult to forecast. It's difficult to forecast. It really is related to where the growth is coming from. It's mostly geographic mix around the world. So what it means ultimately is that, we're getting faster growth and lower revenue per transaction corridors and that's what you're seeing coming through. It varies a little bit, this time it was minus two and it also have to do with product mix, but mostly it's a geographic mix issue that's showing up there. So it's not something that we try to forecast overall, but our revenue outlook envisions whatever might happen there."]], ["We're seeing very strong growth of the dotcom business continue and to your point accelerate, and I guess it just feels like at some point there should be an inflection where it's big enough to more than offset some of the headwinds that you've seen, whether it's on mix or it's on pricing, and potentially something that starts to align more with the volume growth across-border or even the transaction growth on cross-border you're seeing, which is higher than revenue. ", ["Well, digital -- our wu.com business is, it's obviously a much larger than it was a few years ago. It was over 500 million last year, but it's still only 12% of consumer revenues. So, it's going to -- I don't know when that inflection point is -- clearly digital, we still see very strong growth opportunities. Retail, we think will be a flattish type grower, maybe low single digits. But you know, we've had negative growth in some of our other areas, which is really what's driving it down. WU is accelerated, which is good, but our bill payments businesses were negative. Generally speaking, so we need to get better overall performance there. If we could get those mid single digit type of growth and that gives us good flexibility in what we can do overall. So not just digital, digital certainly has to be there, but other components of our business also have to perform a little bit better than they have done."]], ["Just wanted to start on C2C, I know the constant currency rev growth there I think came in at 1%, a little bit below recent trend and the comp is kind of tough in Q1.

And digital, we continue to soon as good growth opportunities there and it's going to become a bigger and bigger piece. So, I think the consumer business overall will be solid and stable. And really is about getting good growth in the other areas, but the consumer business should be relatively stable. The underlying transaction trends have been good, so we've had some variation due to pricing and mix factors, last year in the fourth quarter, but for while the underlying metrics have been solid."]], ["And then, one other thing I wanted to talk a little bit more, I know you've mentioned some of the tech investments, around digital, and some of these opportunities with Amazon in addition to some of the regulatory expenses. ", ["So, the digital investments will be ongoing. Our strategy there is really to drive growth and expansion all over the world. So we're going to it's a continual effort to improve the features and functionality in our platforms. We're launching new sites all the time. And so, you know, that investment will continue for the digital expansion. We're also leveraging our platform for new opportunities like the Amazon relationship. So there's some spending that goes with that. So, we continue to invest in the technology area and that's really to drive long term growth and expansion and so that's really our strategy.\nHikmet Ersek\nI think from also -- if you are already in a country like, U.S. or Europe, it\u2019s a digital which we invested already, it's wining new customers, expanding in the marketing wise, really making commercial on the digital. And if you launch in new country, there were we do investments, and as Raj mentioned the earlier, we want to be in 200 countries like we are in our retail money transfer business. We want to be also with our digital business in 200 countries and we are expanding that. That's one of our biggest competitive advantage is connecting 200 countries with 200 countries and using our payout network and retails with 560,000 locations but also buildings of accounts. We can drop money really monetarily very fast in accounts directly on more than 100 countries. So that investment is going and you could see in the numbers, the growth numbers are coming from digital investments."]], ["So if you think about like in a 12%, I know that there's always lots of moving pieces around margins and scale and investing and expanding that franchise, but is there a way to think just conceptually that by the time digital is at a 20% or 25% of revenue for that C2C.

If you separate the marketing and technology, which is a much heavier concentration than the rest of our business we're spending in marketing technology for the long-term growth of this business. And so, you know, today the margins are lower than the rest of the Company and that continues to be the goal until we get broad expansion all around the world with digital. But when you look at the contribution margin on a percentage basis, and I think we've mentioned this before, the incremental margins are actually similar in both the retail and the digital business, right?\nIt depends on how much money you're sending and the corridor that's involved. But the profitability of a transaction in from a percentage basis is actually quite similar to our retail business. So it can be a very profitable business you can drive the profitability up overnight if we wanted to, but that's not really the strategy we have is really continue to grow our business to 200 countries and territories. And then at some point it will be a better contributor to our overall profitability. And especially as we have more account channels, you know, accounts two accounts capabilities that we're building there that will also help the overall margin profile."]], ["Is that sort of way to think about the inflection point about letting the scale and the growth of digital and that what should be inherently pretty attractive margin start to show through?

We feel very good about the stability of that business. The dot-com business continued to perform well. Latin America, Europe, North America were strong. And then clearly the Middle East region had some issues, we also have some pricing there, so that's what you are seeing in the consumer business.

The account-based digital money transfer is already 2% of our revenue. That's what our agents reported to us. And that's additional to 11% of our revenues were dot-com.

And that's number one. The second thing is that the Saudization project which started in Saudi Arabia, that has been giving jobs to more Saudis than giving jobs to Saud-Asians and that had an impact.\nAnd then the third one is that we adjusted the prices to the customer needs because the earned money was less. There were different economic impacts. And that has been particularly in some parts of Middle East \u2013 I don't want to mention, because of the competitive reasons \u2013 but some parts of the Middle East, not all over the Middle East, we had done some pricing action.

I would say, there are two key drivers there were in Malaysia and Singapore. Those were the two countries. We had done some prior price actions, but that was back in the fourth quarter, so we're still continuing through that. But Australia is probably the biggest market there.

Our anti-money laundering programs, our multi-currency settlement in 131 currency hubs. And that's really the premium that the customers are paying.\nAnd to be on the market, this business has to generate some revenues, and we've been doing a pretty well job there, I guess. The increases, I would say that has been more than mix side. We do invest in some corridors. We decrease in some corridors and it has not been a significant increase, it has been a slight increase. On the commission side, Raj, do you want to say something?\nRajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.\nYeah. On the commission side, we're getting benefits in several different ways, Lara. We've been able to do a good job of bringing our overall retail commissions down over the last several years, and that trend has continued into this year. We also are getting the mix benefits from a faster growing digital business because that business is digitally initiated, either credit card, debit card, or bank account, but then one side of it pays out at a retail location, so that mix is benefiting us.\nWe really want to look at overall distribution costs in the company, and our goal is to bring total distribution costs down. So, as the business mix changes over time where we have more bank funding and bank payout and other ways of distributing the product, that's going to help us as well. So, we're pleased with the overall commission trends as well."]], ["And then was there \u2013 and I'm sorry, I missed part of the call \u2013 a benefit from the volatility in currency and foreign currency volatility picked up quite a bit in the first quarter. ", ["Yeah, just on the first part before I give to Raj. One thing also I want to mention is our principal grew impressive 9% this quarter and our transactions also grew. So, the people are using our services more and more. I think our pricing environment has been well received by the customers. Sorry, Raj.\nRajesh K. Agrawal - The Western Union Co.\nYeah, no problem. And, Bob, yeah, volatility, I would say there was a lot of market volatility. I'm not so sure that we saw a lot of foreign exchange volatility. So, it was not a big driver in our B2B business or more broadly in the company. I don't think that was really a factor for us to call out."]], ["Curious why the top end of guidance wasn't raised concerning the strong revenue performance, should we be worrying about anything in the back half of the year that could mute performance? ", ["Yeah, thanks, Craig, joining the call. As I mentioned earlier in that call, I think that we are very pleased with our start. And we have a strong quarter and we're continuing with our performance from 2017, and our programs we put in place are really especially in the C2C businesses is doing well. And that's the outcome of that in Q1. Our customer relationship and our customer experience in retail has been doing very well and our dot-com business has been growing, and adding new customers, by the way, additional customers to our network with our dot-com business doing really well. So, I think we are, from a growth perspective, we are pleased with that. It's too early to give \u2013 we believe it's too early to give a new guidance here, but we are confident with our business and we're pleased with our outcome.\nAnd second part of the question was the Walmart part, I answered that question earlier. Look, Walmart is one of the many competitors worldwide, especially if you operate in 200 countries like we do, and 20,000 corridors like we do, there are many competitors. Just to put things in perspective, Walmart has 5,000 locations, 4,700 locations in the U.S. We have about 50,000 locations in U.S. to sending to 550,000 locations worldwide and more than 3 billion bank accounts worldwide. So, I think the connection that we build from the U.S. outbound is very competitive.\nIf we have to adjust prices, we will adjust. It's one of the corridors; we may do pricing promotions around the Walmart locations. That's what we do daily. It's nothing new for us to compete in the market. That's what we do daily, and the team is doing a good job."]], ["Thank you so much, good afternoon it's good to see the acceleration in the C2C business so I'll ask just on the digital side I'm curious how are the margins performing for digital, I know its 10% of revenues now. ", ["Firstly, I am pleased with our performance overall. I would say especially as driven by the digital as you have mentioned. Last quarter 20% growth plus 20% growth, and we are quite -- we are only in 40 countries and the growth is still coming mainly from the countries which we've been longer existing and the new countries that are small not adding too much to the absolute numbers but growing very strong. And as you know we want to be in 200 countries with our westernunion.com delivering to 200 countries. So today we are sending money from 40 countries to 200 countries and that's going to expand obviously that's what's Khalid and the team all are doing very fast. And we are really picking the main corridors where we can compete and we can really grow strong. So, I am quite optimistic.\nOn margin side, I think that's truly good margin. Obviously, we are still in the investment mode. We are still in the marketing. Our main focus is in growth but we are very pleased also with the margin side and the .com side."]], ["Just start pricing on the topline, the topline outlook obviously going for an acceleration and I know FX is part of that but we saw some benefit from pricing in the current quarter as you said. ", ["I think we see the pricing environment stable and I think that as I mentioned several quarters earlier that the pricing environment has been stable because it\u2019s complex and it\u2019s some costs some operational expense to do this business to operate in 200 countries, so it is hard to -- our operation model reflects our pricing in the market, we are around an average 15% more pricy than the other competitors but has been stable. I don't see any changes here short term if nothing something big thing happens but I don't see the changes.\nThe other thing though is also I would say that we're going to continue to do pricing investment in certain corridors but overall the transaction trends has been also stable. It's not like only on the pricing side so the transaction has been also very stable and very strong growth on the dotcom side on the digital side."]], ["Your business I think has held up a lot better than many would have thought a few years ago, but as you look at your business today and get a little bit of an acceleration in the quarter what do you view, what do you keep an eye on as your biggest risks or competitors? ", ["So that's a good question obviously. I'm thinking about that daily. So, one thing I realized also is that over the years certainly build something is really very competitive. But having this cross-order engine or platform with the regulatory compliance and technology advantage has been working and working and we are now what we are doing is that really taking that to the next stage with our WU Way and technology investments. We are taking that also to the next stage.\nSo, one thing is that we are going to the market with our WU branded products like we are now retail with Western Union and on our Westernunion.com with WU branded products.\nThe other thing is also we see good growth is that to white labeling of our platform to partners like financial institutions or big businesses. I think I got more and more calls from other businesses also from financial institutions, can you help us to deliver exotic currencies or minor currencies to certain countries or having also businesses delivering our platform doing the multi-currency settlement for many countries or also the compliance programs for many countries. That\u2019s something that I think coming here we are very focused on that, besides committed to our Western Union growth. This platform could be used also for some white labeling to extent our platform our new businesses and your financial institutions.\nMichael Salop\nThanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. We wish you a good day."]], ["I come up with something north of $1.3 billion on the free cash flow, which would seem to be providing quite a bit of room for either working capital build or something else going on. ", ["Mark, this is Ward. So you're right. You read key components of the guidance correctly. So the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA range is $3.1 billion cash interest will be around $400 million. The cash tax rates rises from 17% to 21%. We did say in my comments that we expected a modest increase in working capital so there'll be some normal seasonal fluctuations as we go through our maintenance outages and execute the strategic capital projects. In addition, part of the strong performance that we had in Q4, there was some timing of, we had a very strong cash collections quarter in Q4. There was some amount of that was timing Q4 versus Q1 and then we also mentioned that we're rebuilding our inventory levels and consumer as we came out of the strategic outages.\nWe will be focused on driving free cash flow generation, we did say more than $1 billion and we'll be focused on inventory reductions as we go through the year and also on expanding our supply chain, financing and payables to balance the exposure that we have with our customers as they push for extended terms. So we feel very confident in this guidance and we said more than $1 billion there is implied a small working capital build and we are going to strive to minimize that."]], ["My other question, taking a step back, you talk about, and you're seeing it in total, a benefit from cross selling between corrugated and consumer and you also talk about the benefits that you're getting from sustainability across the platform. ", ["This is Pat Lindner. Yes, it's a bit and so the consumer volumes as you noted in the quarter were down overall and the converting volumes were up and they were up actually year-over-year quite significantly and are in the 4% to 5% range. The challenge we had in the 4th quarter around volumes really wasn't related to cross selling. It really was related to is what Steve mentioned in more mentioned around restoring our inventory levels, primarily in SBS as well as in C&K from the strategic outages. And just to give you an idea of that when you look at fiscal year ' 19, overall production across all of our paperboard grades or was about 60,000 tons less than in fiscal year ' 18 and that was really because of our strategic outages. So we're obviously now coming out of that in the first quarter here.\nOur fiscal first quarter, we're building our inventories back so we can capture some of that growth, but we see tremendous demand in consumer and corrugated across the whole enterprise. We see tremendous demand driven by sustainability and plastics replacement and we're going to continue to capture that as our ability to supply restores to normal levels."]], ["So differently said consumer volume was only up slightly on a converted basis but given the cross-sell opportunity from corrugated given the benefit that you should be getting from sustainability, should we be seeing perhaps a stronger volume growth number in Consumer on a converted basis? ", ["This is Pat Lindner. Yes, it's a bit and so the consumer volumes as you noted in the quarter were down overall and the converting volumes were up and they were up actually year-over-year quite significantly and are in the 4% to 5% range.

", ["This is Pat. Good morning. So let me talk about the backlogs. First is your first question. So as you've seen in some of the published industry statistics, some of the backlogs have come down and with some seasonal softness. This is typical of what's happened over the last three or four years, so CRB is down around 3 And SBS might be around three or four weeks of backlog. C&K isn't published and we think those are really in the normal typical range across the industry, so we see typical activity.\nNow our situation, as I mentioned in the one of my prior answers the situation is a little bit different primarily on SBS so CRB and C&K or in the normal ranges for us kind of three to four weeks at that lower end of what we shared SBS is a little bit different to the higher end and that's generally in the area of four to six weeks. The reason for that is really attributable to the strategic outages that we had, that I mentioned before and the reduced availability of capacity and volume to sell in some of our, some of our markets so our SBS backlogs continue to be longer or a little bit longer than what the industry is publishing.\nWe expect to catch up on some of that although in the first quarter, we do have a high number of maintenance outages that we we're not able to complete in fiscal year '19 and so we'll continue through this fiscal quarter to continue to restore all those inventories and naturally we want to serve our customers to the best of our ability and bring those backlogs down so we can, serve them in the shortest time possible when they place the demand. Relating to your second question around integration, we think about integration in really 2 different parts. Number one is around specialty applications and this is really around three primary market segments of tobacco, commercial and liquid packaging.\nThese are all SBS product or markets we serve those with SBS and in each one of those were specified downstream in there really to the end user and that's about 40% of our total SBS that we sell. So we consider that to be integrated through those specialty applications. When you look at food, food service beverage and healthcare and some of the other areas where we're integrated by converting the paperboard in our converting facilities, SBS assets at about 20% C&K at 70 and CRB at about 60% and our view of integration really hasn't changed that much.\nWe generally view integration as a positive, especially as we get close to our end user customers and sustainability and sustainable packaging and plastics replacement. So it's generally a positive and we'll continue to look for ways attractive ways to increase our integration levels, but at the same time, our open market paperboard sales in those segments is very important to us.\nMany of our customers service local, regional markets that are assets in our sales forces, are not as adapt at serving are capable of serving. So we see this nice mix of integration where we'll continue to look to improve and increase our integration level combined with accessing the open market paperboard sales is a really healthy and nice combination."]]]
