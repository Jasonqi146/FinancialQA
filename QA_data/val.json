Machine number one had run previously door assort, so we're moving back door assort to machine number one and craft pack to number two, we're reducing the container board we could swing them. It gives us flexibility to swing if we wanted to, but we're looking at the door assortment craft pack moving those and then running 288,000 tons less of our container board at that mill.

I think when you look at a project like we're undertaking at Charleston. There is not a textbook that allows you to just have that come out of the answer. So the people we have, looking at our mill system, looking at our box system and how its operated as efficiently and come up with opportunities to invest capital to get even more out of what we have.\nI couldn't be more proud of the people we have in that business, and it shows up in the results and I thank you went back to 2012 and if you look at the way people have talked about the assets that we've acquired we've made, I think tremendous use of the assets on both the converting side and the mill site and compensate that with the strategy to take care of our customers, and I think that's producing the results and I expect we're going to be able to continue to do that going forward."]], ["So you're forecasting up one to 2 this year, you're up 2.5 last year is the lower rate of growth you're expecting just see economies slowing down, e-commerce slowing down; can you just give me a little sense as to what's, what you're thinking there?

We will invest over $1 billion in these projects.

So we are comfortable that the ongoing level of strategic \u2013 base CapEx is going to be in that $900 million to $1 billion range. There is a small tail of the Tr\u00eas Barras mill in fiscal 2021. We have about $50 million to $60 million of capital that remains in FY 2021, and then the rest of it is our base CapEx that we're comfortable with.

The demand on the kraft paper in aggregate is a bit matching containerboard. I think there has been more pressure lately on the kraft-bag markets. The extensible market's more challenged and that was really because seeds, cements, fertilizer in the Midwest, our customers' producing for those who were affected by the floods. So, that's off a bit along with the kraft bag, but not -- it's not substantial. It's a few thousand tons from what we expected.\nAnd overall I would say that if you looked at inventories and stock where we have seen destocking in the containerboard space, the kraft bag space is a bit different right now. And we see inventories higher in a bit of a slower destocking in our kraft sack business and the extensible is where we have seen more than our regular bag.\nIn the long-term, I think yes that we have opportunities through our customers with plastic replacements and opportunities in the sustainability realm. And as I said we're looking at pouches, envelopes, and other things we can use in our kraft space."]], ["It looks like the CapEx guide for 2020 and 2021 is a little lower than what I think you had said in the past and yes, you are maintaining obviously the high profile projects you went through.

But I certainly can give you some perspective on what\u2019s happening in the markets. And I would like to focus most of this on CNK, because I think this is a pretty dynamic marketplace where we are seeing really strong demand for this product and it has really been driven by a number of things.\nIn the beverage market it\u2019s been driven by the demand for wet and high strength applications. Beverage as well as frozen food and I think really capitalizing on the opportunity from plastics into the paper-based products. And so, we expect that demand to continue. I think, as Steve mentioned, we\u2019ve got $50 million or so of sales into that plastics to paper conversion.\nThat\u2019s certainly driving strength. In CNK, we continue to have strong backlogs there. And we expect to get $100 million of sales this year in that type of a conversion again from plastics to paper and many more \u2013 many times over that going into the future.\nAnd I think the other thing around CNK that\u2019s pretty interesting right now is that the brown side of CNK is viewed by consumers as environmentally friendly. And again, adding to the strength that we see there. So, we are pretty bullish on what we see in CNK and we are also excited about having the Mahrt Mill back up and running with that big investment that we have there.\nAnd getting back to servicing our customers the highest level that we can."]], ["And shifting gears a little bit, historically, I think the industry and at least WestRock has talked about box is performing to a spec as opposed to the specific linerboard or medium that goes into on whether it's a recycled or kraft content.

So they want us to build a box that suited for how they use it and the conditions that go into DCs and warehouses. So we are building a box to the spec. The quality of our paper products across our mill system.\nWhether that's recycled or virgin, we are using liners that are recycled or virgin and applications that meet our customers\u2019 demands. So, we could do that with a 42-pound virgin kraft liner or 42-pound recycled liner same thing with high performance liner. So, either ECT values or performance-based specs or what our customers are moving to and we are well positioned to meet that demand."]], ["Is it more just external shipments whether that's export pricing, et cetera, if you could just sort of bridge the old to the new, what were the buckets that really moved?

So, our current guidance range reflects potentially lower volumes to our both domestic and export containerboard and lower volumes relative to our previous expectations on the kraft side as well. We've also flowed through the impact of the $10 per ton published price decrease for the balance of the year.\nNow, we have had some benefits and lower recycled fiber. But as we talked about, we had elevated virgin fiber and energy costs in Q2. Although, we are seeing moderation in second half, it's moderating from a higher point. And then we've taken, we've highlighted the downtime that we've taken in the month of April.\nOur full-year outlook for the Consumer business is really largely unchanged. So the primary drivers have been a reflection of the supply demand conditions that we've seen in Corrugated. And beside all of that, we are still focused on all the things that are in our control. We are executing the strategic capital projects. We are focused on capturing the synergies and completing the integration of KapStone.

First, we\u2019re meeting our customers\u2019 critical challenges in the market. So, we\u2019re delivering no fill basics, which starts with perfect quality and on-time delivery. And then secondly, our value proposition is helping our customers lower their total cost, increase their sales, minimize their risk, and also helping them maximize their environmental footprint. We\u2019re delivering on those four pillars and our value proposition. We continue to differentiate with our machine sales, our enterprise sales; we can bring a lot to the table for our customers. So, we continue to execute well across the system. In our markets that we continually see that e-commerce continues to be favorable for us. our bakery snack business is favorable, distribution, our food process, pizza and everything that goes along with that across our systems have been favorable and we also have positive in our retail and consumer.\nSo, across the board, we continue to see opportunities to grow the business organically. We continue to deliver on those no fill basics, which has helped us stay strong. On the linerboard, so, it\u2019s interesting in the pricing, we\u2019ve seen some pressures pulp and paper published on medium and there was some pressure. We\u2019re seeing some spot pressure on medium in the markets, but we have not seen the same in our linerboard. So, our linerboard and box pricing, we haven\u2019t seen the same pressures.

We simply took action to respond to the lower operating cash flow from the EBITDA reduction and we have deferred CapEx. Embedded in that target this year, we will invest approximately $500 million across the strategic capital projects that amount should drop in half to about $250 million next year. So when \u2013 after we complete those projects, as we exit FY 2020, I anticipate that FY 2021 will return to our long-term ongoing CapEx investment level of $1 billion of which 50% of that $1 billion is M&R and 50% of it is discretionary return-generating capital."]], ["When I look at the guidance, it looks like in essence you\u2019re guiding to obviously down from the consensus for the next quarter on an EBITDA basis, but the second half is higher.

It was closer to 10% and then embedded in that overall $280 million to $300 million obviously includes wage, benefit, and other cost inflation."]], ["Ward, just couple of questions, one on the CapEx guidance this year of $1.5 billion, do you have a sense of how much growth CapEx you'll spend in fiscal 2020 just at least based on what will bleed over from Florence and Tres Barras?

So on the strategic projects again we are across Florence, Porto Feliz, Mahrt, Covington, and Tres Barras. That's going to contribute about $500 million of CapEx in fiscal 2019. That number should drop to approximately half of that rate in fiscal 2020 because we'll just be at the tail end of Florence. This is a high investment year for Florence.\nWe'll invest about $100 million in Tres Barras this year and almost $200 million next year. But then the Porto Feliz, Mahrt, and Covington projects will be done as we exit this fiscal year. So the strategic projects' contribution should fall from $500 million to down to closer to $250 million for next year. And then we've talked about the fact that our base CapEx is allocated almost equivalently between return generating and maintenance projects."]], ["I wondered, could you talk going forward whether you think the paperboard packaging business is going to kind of shift from being kind of what's traditionally been a regional business to being more of a global business?

And I think where we see it, and we've seen it in the MPS market and MPS customers, and I'll explain it in a second. But I think we're cognizant of that as we're going through the acquisition. I think for those customers that have a global buy, so I think that's one condition. And then the second condition is they have to have a strong feeling for consistent quality of their packaging around the globe. Those type of customers, there is a opportunity to supply packaging on a global basis to those customers. Let's say, if somebody is regional, then that won't be the case. If somebody is global and isn't -- has different brands or isn't concerned about the quality, it's not the case. But the global customers, they care about quality. It certainly is the opportunity, and we see it today with those customers that we're able to serve those customers around the world and have consistent print quality for those customers.\nBob Feeser\nMark, this is Bob. If I could just follow up on that. So where that really plays out is in the health care markets and in the beverage markets. And as you might imagine, with pharmaceutical companies, there's more of a focus on having a consistent quality packaging system around the world. So those are the end end markets, in particular, that really lend themselves to more broad-based international coverage."]], ["It's interesting, we've heard pretty much from the top 8 players, except for the one private one -- one of the private ones in terms of what their needs are going to be to supply growth going forward.

I've also mentioned on other calls that besides pulling from export, we could invest to add capacity in our current mill system. We haven't had to do that. And with the KapStone acquisition, I don't see us having to do that in the short term. But demand remains strong. There is a need for capacity based on demand for box.

So 4.1% is everything and includes sheets, Canada. But if you do just the FBA comparison, our quarter was over 6% per day and 8% overall. So that's note number one. Note number two is, no. And last July, if you look at where we were, we were up 12%. So the business continues to run full. There's no difference in any of our backlogs. July is typically a slower month. We have the 4th of July. You have customers who took downtime for maintenance. They have vacations or -- a couple of our customers have a week or two off.

So, we\u2019re constantly evaluating our timberlands to determine, you know, for the best owner of that particular tract or if we can capture a higher value by selling it through our AVO process. So, as we\u2019ve noted, we have about \u2013 you know, at the beginning of the year, we had 1.6 million acres identified in the AVO process that we would take to market over the next 10 to 15 years.

And so, I don't have anything, you know, significant to highlight of the, you know, Millport or Dierks magnitude. It\u2019s really just a lot of all are CapEx projects that are really focused on, you know, driving down cost, improving reliability, and really driving efficiencies in the mill set.

", ["Yes, absolutely. We do spend a lot of time doing analytics around that and, you know, with respect to Japan, you're absolutely right. The demographics are such that the population is declining and that is clearly going to have an impact on housing over time. You know, I think a couple things that may mitigate the impact on us however or again, you know, our focus is primarily that post and beam market and I think that is going to hold share and pick up share of overall housing starts in Japan over time. And so, I think the impact in us will be less than on kind of the stick frame.\nThe second thing I would say is, you know, just like in the United States and Europe, Japan is looking for opportunities to do more commercial and multi-story buildings out of wood. And so, I think there's an opportunity to pick up share on that front as well to mitigate some of the impacts from population decline on housing. But you're right, in a broader sense, you know, Japan's population is not growing. There are other economies across Asia where we do see growing populations. And so whether you're thinking China or India or some of the other Southeast Asian markets that are experiencing growth, we\u2019ve spent a lifetime on the ground in all of those markets.\nWe have, you know, in China in particular a pretty strong customer base.

", ["Yeah. Sure, George. And I think I would note that we have seen an uptick in the first half of the year that really sort of translated all the way into Q3 on Southern sawlog prices. So we have seen a bit of an uptick this year. Now, candidly some of that had to do with the rain that we had in the first part of the year, the tension in some of the wood baskets, but I think we have seen some improvement year-over-year.\nBut ultimately, what it comes down to is supply and demand within the region, and this has been a long story in terms of getting the Southern sawlog prices up. But ultimately what gives us confidence that ultimately we are going to see the improvement is the improved capacity that we're seeing coming into the U.S. South 5.5 billion board feet of incremental capacity coming in. When we look at the wood baskets where the new mills have come in we have seen tensioning within those wood baskets. And as that capacity continues to come in and get online you see that tensioning effect.\nAdditionally, on the pulp side, we've seen a number of pellet mills come in. In fact, Enviva just broke ground on a new pellet mill in Mississippi. And so it takes time for each of those mills to come in, get up to speed and start taking logs. But again, as we've seen these mills come in, in the specific wood baskets where we've seen incremental capacity you see a tensioning effect. And over time that brings up the demand across the system.\nThe other thing I would just note is, over time we also think there is an opportunity for an export program to really develop out of the U.S. South. Pre-tariffs, we were really working to build up that program and making some good headway in terms of exporting logs out of the U.S. South. I think ultimately when the tariff dispute ultimately comes to resolution we're going to see that opportunity open back up. And so it takes time, it's been slower than we would have expected or like, but I think we're on the right trajectory over time."]], ["Devin, I mean, relatedly and you're correct there has been a little bit of a bump this year, but certainly timber prices are nowhere where anyone would have expected a few years ago at least I don't think in the South or also where they are right now.

And so I think the biggest driver that you see in terms of Western log prices is what's going on with the Western lumber prices. And so when you have mills that see lumber prices reduce dramatically, there's a limit to how much they can pay for logs and keep those cash flow positive.\nSo I'd say that's been the biggest driver. There have been a couple of other things around the margins the trade dispute with China. We continue to ship logs to our customers in China, but I do think a number of other landowners in the Pacific Northwest have kept some of that supply in the domestic market.\nA little bit around the margins, there were some wind damage in South Oregon. And so there's been a little bit to salvage activity there that's been a little bit of headwind down in that market, but overall the big driver has really just been Western lumber prices.\nAnd so as we look forward sitting where we are today, we're moving into the rainy season here in the Pacific Northwest. In fact, last few weeks it has been pretty rainy up here, and that typically will take the non-industrial landowners out of the system. It will reduce log flow.

", ["Yeah. Anthony, this is Russell. So we did announce the 555,000 acres sale to Lyme timber for $300 million at $540 an acre. And that represents our total Michigan ownership. We have a mix of hardwood logs and pulpwood, so we service both some saw milling and then also pulp activities up there and then there is also a softwood component. We're on target to close in the fourth quarter and so we're very pleased with the overall transaction and the outcome.\nAs far as other Northern Timberlands, I won't comment on specifics, but as we demonstrated, we continue to look at the portfolio. Our goal is to optimize the portfolio over time and the Michigan sale was part of that ongoing effort. So it's a key strategic driver of ours to make sure that we have the right mix of acres that will drive the highest return to the shareholders over time. So we're constantly looking at all of our regions and it's something we're always evaluating, both on the buy side and on the sell side.\nSo as part of that process, we're going to identify certain timberlands that may not be strategic for us and we'll act on those appropriately. And on the buy side, we can be very patient. We have 12 million acres. We're in every operating region in the United States. And so we can be patient and make sure that anything that we contemplate creates shareholder value over time."]], ["And just again to kind of come back on the issue of how Northern Timberland is identified, if we look at the South and the West, you're really a plantation forestry company and much of what you got kind of across the North is just kind of natural regeneration.

When you think of the North, it's -- the West it's pretty consistent I guess growing areas primarily Doug fir, primarily the sawlog outcome; in the South, it's Southern Yellow Pine, pine plantation. When you look in the North, we really have four distinct kind of areas. We have Montana and Michigan, Maine and then West Virginia and each one of them have distinct products, distinct customers, distinct strategies. And so, I would say that you do need to look at it on an individual kind of region basis in the North or in the North it's not as comparable clearly to the West or the South."]], ["And the last one on the Northern Timberland, just we have a lot of carnage right now in the hardwood lumber business and I'm understanding some really underperforming properties on the timberland side in hardwood.

I think certainly as we think about going forward to the extent that the trade dispute can get resolved, I think that will be alleviated, but it's going to be some tough sledding in that market until that ultimately does happen. In terms of specific opportunities, I don't know that there is anything that we would highlight right now. We're watching the market across the board that's true both in the hardwood business and really the rest of our ownerships, so nothing specific to highlight on that right now."]], ["Just over on the Wood Products side of your portfolio, we've been hearing for several months more positive commentary and results from the homebuilders but it really hasn't to this point kind of flowed through to the suppliers to the homebuilders. ", ["Yes, Mark. I think part of this earlier in the summer, when we really started to see a little bit of pickup in the activity was there was a bit of destocking. I think there was probably a bit more spec home inventory in the system that had to be worked through. And so not all of that pickup in activity really translated into actual Wood Products demand pull through.\nI think you're starting to see that get more into balance. And as we see the starts activity and the new home sales activity continue to improve that should have more pull through. The other thing I think that's been really hard in terms of dialing in the supply-demand dynamic is with all of the curtailment activity that we've seen that introduces noise into the system.\nAnd so when you see some of these mills take indefinite or permanent shutdowns, there is an inventory flushing that typically occurs in the system. And I think that's part of what we saw in Q3 as some of these mills closed down and we're really eliminating the inventory.\nYou probably saw a little bit more of that flushing through that had a bit of a dampening effect on pricing. But ultimately there is no question as we continue to see housing improve and if this trend continues which we think it will that ultimately will result in more Wood Products demand. And you combine that with the curtailment activity, put the noise aside that will be I think a positive for commodity pricing across the board."]], ["And then just shifting gears, I noticed two of the businesses that six, seven years ago that seem to really be struggling had -- basically were the bright spots of the quarter from one I can tell, and that of course would be the distribution business and especially engineered wood products.

But I would say at a higher level, this is the case really across all of our manufacturing businesses. We have been doing a lot of work to improve our operating performance and to improve our cost structure, and that's true in EWP. It's true in our distribution business. And although we've seen product pricing a bit challenging this year, I would say that's equally true for lumber and OSB. These businesses are operating as well as they ever have, and that has been a really important focus for us in our overall business strategy.\nAnd so, you're seeing that now. I think as we alluded to earlier, when the businesses are operating well and we're continuing to prove -- improve every day. When we do see an uptick in the housing activity and the commodity prices, we're really well positioned to generate a lot of value from these assets."]], ["I mean I have a sense that your system is low cost, and I'm just wondering is that due to your fiber baskets in which you operate, the equipment or maybe the proximity to markets?

I mean amongst our various manufacturing assets, some are maybe a little bit better located relative to fiber than others. I wouldn't say that in and of itself is the key driver, it's really just been the continued focus on improving our operations and keeping a very tight control on cost. And that ultimately has been the big driver for us.\nSteven Chercover\nOkay. And then in honor of the World Series, I've got a curveball for you. And it does kind of center on control. So in Oregon you have an office manager who stole $4.5 million from you over 15 years. And I assume it's an isolated incident. But are you putting in safeguards to ensure that this can't happen again?\nDevin Stockfish\nYeah. Well as you can imagine, this case is currently under criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney. So there is a limited amount we can really comment on. But what I would say is, it's very disappointing.\nThe employee obviously no longer works for us. We've instituted appropriate controls to ensure that this doesn't happen again.

Thank you."]], ["I think you noted in the release you expect it to be flat sequentially assuming that price realizations are flat, but then I think in the prepared remarks, you also talked about assuming higher lumber and OSB prices.

So as we look at quarter-over-quarter, and the activity pricing has been pretty flat, but we would expect as we come into later in the summer, as activity increases, that we'll see improving pricing.\nSo that's kind of how we're looking at it. We're really in just really a good position to benefit from that improvement in pricing.\nDevin Stockfish\nJust to follow-up on that, I think directionally, we're expecting a pricing uplift. As we see construction activity continue to pick up in the back half of the year, obviously, there have been a lot of curtailments and mill closure announcements.\nI think those are still working their way through the system. So directionally, we're expecting an uplift. I think, for us, the challenge is quantifying the timing and the magnitude."]], ["Just wondering how long you think it will take for some of that to create some tension on the market?\nAnd I guess tied into that question; how would you assess the inventories in the channel and sort of your own inventories? ", ["Yes, so let me speak to channel inventory first and then I'll get back to your second question. I'd say, as a general statement across the industry, I would say that inventory levels are in the normal range. Now there may be a few geographies where it's a little high or a little low. But on balance, I think they're in a normal range.\nI do think one of the dynamics that you're seeing at present is that buyers are generally not building inventories. They feel pretty confident that they can get supply on an 'as needed' basis to meet their needs. And so I wouldn't say that inventories are in an extreme level by any means.\nThe one I guess caveat to that is on SPF as you alluded to with some of the mill closures and curtailments, some of that volume from those mills that are closing down seems to be finding its way into the market. And I think that's been a little bit of a headwind on SPF here just recently.\nThat being said, there have been a lot of capacity that's coming out of the system for the announced mill closures. There is a little noise in the system as that volume flows through, as you think about mills that are closing down. They're going to have to move their inventories out into the market and sometimes that will put a little pressure on things.\nBut after that it sort of works its way through the system. We would expect that to normalize over time, whether that's two weeks, four weeks, what have you, hard to predict. But certainly, directionally, that's what we would expect to happen."]], ["Maybe it's finally starting to work its way from the initial stages of creating an oversupply of logs that maybe now restricting supply a bit.\nI was wondering if you could talk about that market and how in general that's impacting you? ", ["Yes. So there are really two things going on in British Columbia. One, as you mentioned, is the impact of the pine beetle and forest fire, which has reduced the overall supply of timber. Now, I would say that it's differential by region.\nAnd so when you're talking about certain areas in sort of the mid-B.C. range, it's a little bit more heavily impacted. Where we own a mill is a little bit further south. The wood basket that we operate in, hasn't been impacted in a meaningful way by the pine beetle or forest fire. So our fiber supply at our mill is actually in reasonably good shape.\nThe other piece that you've been hearing about from a log cost perspective is the way that they do stumpage rates in British Columbia. And that reset on July 1st. It went up. You've probably heard that talk to you from a number of our competitors that are bigger in that region. And so that's the other impact on log cost, it's just the method that they used to calculate stumpage rates.\nFor us, given the wood basket that we operate in, where fiber is a little bit more available, we have a mill that's a low-cost mill, top quartile cost structure in that region. And so even with the increased stumpage rates, I think we're feeling pretty good about the operations that we have in British Columbia."]], ["First, some of the research and some of the commentary that we've heard and seen suggest that one of the issues that's been impacting homebuilding is a lot of issues that you had mentioned in terms of land availability, labor availability and so on.

Now the issue there is that something, typically that you have to battle out at the local level. The one thing that does give me some optimism around that, however, is there is a growing appreciation I think in the public policy space that affordable housing is a real issue that must be resolved.\nYou've heard the governor of California talk about building 2.5 million to 3 million units to just get back up to base level demand. Here in Seattle, where the markets tight. It's a topic of conversation regularly. And I think you're seeing that play out. Now, the challenge in moving local governments is going to be differential depending on where you are in the country.

And so, part of the uplift that you saw was attributable to weather. I will say, as we continue to see the manufacturing capacity come into the region and get up and running in those wood baskets. I think that's another piece that added to the uplift on pricing.\nOur view is that will be something that will continue on. Now that's local to those specific wood baskets, but I do think where we've seen that that's putting an upward pricing pressure. With respect to going into Q3, I think on balance we're expecting comparable quarter-over-quarter pricing. You're going to see maybe a little bit more pricing pressure in some of those regions that have just recently seen a whole bunch of rain, maybe a little less so in regions that have been dryer.

", ["Yes, Chip. And that really was just some maintenance downtime that extended a little bit longer than we had anticipated. At a high level, we're obviously always trying to match our supply with profitable demand, generate appropriate returns over time.\nI think with our products mix, and remember, we're predominantly a value-added OSB product. So we are not as heavy into the commodity sheeting business. And when we combine that with all the work that we've done on our cost structure, it allows us to be cash flow positive where others perhaps may not.\nAnd so in Q2, every one of our OSB mills was cash flow positive in every month, unless they had scheduled maintenance downtime. And I'd say, obviously the ultimate goal is not to just to be cash flow positive. The goal is to exceed earnings in excess of your cost-to-capital over time and that's certainly our expectation. But we're continuing to watch that and monitor it closely."]], ["I just had a couple of easy questions on the wood product side, one surprise to me was EWP and the outperformance there and it doesn't seem to be price related at all. ", ["Yes well, that's a great point I'd just say I'm incredibly proud of the work that our EWP team is doing. Really there are a couple of things there it's first and foremost, our manufacturing team is doing a great job managing costs, running our mills efficiently, and that's a great starting point. We've got terrific products in our EWP business and our sales and marketing team does an excellent job of servicing customers and that's a good recipe for success regardless of market conditions.\nAnd so, we were able to move profitable volume across our portfolio of products in the quarter and I think that's really what drove the results."]], ["And then just a quick question on Southern log obviously, there is still a 25% tariff in China and you discussed the weakness in radiata pine and some of the underlying weakness in China. ", ["With respect to China Southern Yellow Pine at a 25% tariff that's a pretty steep headwind. And so we're still shipping to China at a relatively low level really the amount that we need just to keep the supply chain open. We've got a few really good customers in China for Southern Yellow Pine and they're using that still. And so we're still getting a bit of a takeaway on the Southern Yellow Pine but certainly at a much-reduced rate than we had been on a trajectory even a year ago.\nWith respect to India, we have been shipping into that market sort of off and on over the last 18 months. One of the things that we saw when they put the tariffs on Southern Yellow Pine that caused some market disruptions. Some of the volume that was headed for China ended up in India. And so it was a little choppy, but I think that's normalized a bit and so I think that will be an interesting market for us, still very small, but an opportunity to grow over time."]], ["I guess my first question, Devin, if you could comment -- what's your current estimate of operating rates this year, if you could provide one, for -- across your Wood Products businesses? ", ["Yes, sure. So on your first question, in lumber, we're -- our operating rates for Q1 were in the low 90s. In OSB, they're in the mid-90s and EOP, they were in the kind of low 80s for operating rates. With respect to OSB, my sense is that it's going to take a little time for us to have the demand catch up with the supply with the new mills coming online and really getting up full.\nThere's probably going to be a little bit more inventory in the system this year until we catch up from a demand perspective. Now that being said, I do think if we see the continued housing construction activity build into the spring and summer season and demand gets back up to where we think it ultimately will be, that should come back into balance over the course of the year and into 2020."]], ["I took from your guidance on Timberlands again that you're not seeing anything other than normal seasonal increases in harvest costs and that's part of what is driving the sequential decline 2Q versus 1Q, but I want a confirmation on that. ", ["Yes. Maybe I'll take the first one and then Russell can take the second one. Just in terms of the quarter-over-quarter, really, on the Timberlands segment basis, it's really a couple of things. It's about half of that relates to the ordinary cost increases that you see in Q2. So we build more roads, we have higher forestry expenses, we did defer a little bit of silviculture in Q1 that's going to get pushed to Q2. So that's about half of it.\nThe other half is really just around timing of vessel shipments. And so we had a couple of ships that ordinarily, we are -- going into the quarter, we thought would ship out in Q2. They moved up a little bit into Q1. So that's the other piece. And then the last piece, which is a smaller piece of the puzzle is just, as you know, in the northern business, we go through spring breakup and so you see the volumes come down. And so that's really the driver of Q2 versus Q1.\nRussell Hagen\nAnd George, on the $15 million after-tax legal charge, that's just for potential settlement of various legal matters."]], ["And then it was good to see the Southern log price realizations tick up a little bit in the quarter, and I guess the outlook for 2Q implies that we stay at similar levels. ", ["Yes. And so we absolutely saw a healthy increase in pricing. And I'll tell you, I think the majority of that is due to weather. We had a really, really wet Q1 and that kept inventory levels low. It kept supply levels moderated, and so that was really reflected in the pricing that you saw. That being said, I do think we are starting to see some of those pockets that we've been talking about for years really start the tension where we have the new capacity coming online and running full. And certainly, we've seen that in areas of Central Mississippi, some areas in Arkansas, a few geographies in Alabama and most recently in Northern Louisiana.\nAnd so as we said, when that new mill capacity comes online and gets up and running full in that geography, that micro region, we are seeing some pricing tension. So on balance, I think the price increase was largely driven by weather, but we are starting to see the early signs of some tensioning in some of those micro markets."]], ["And then a second thing that sort of caught my attention was you has mentioned that you had run in the low 90s in Lumber and the mid-90s and OSB during the first quarter, which are pretty good operating rates. ", ["Yes, Mark. So I would just comment, with respect to OSB, we did say that we're expecting to be higher in Q2. That's really a pretty small percentage relative to Q1. We were operating well in OSB, in the mid-90s already in OSB, so not a lot of uptick. The bigger uptick really is around EWP and a little bit Lumber as well. And I guess just with respect to your question around philosophy, a big part of how we look at our strategy is making sure that we have a really low cost structure so that we can continue to make money and drive cash flow regardless of pricing. And so it may make sense for us to run where it may not make sense for others to run. But again, it's a big part of our OpEx program being black at the bottom and are focused on having the right cost structure."]], ["And if prices are now $10 lower than they were on average during the first quarter, you're presumably not making much money in OSB at all, and yet you're running potentially higher than in the mid-90s in that business.

", ["Yes. I think one of the things that may be mitigated to some of that during Q1 was just because it was so rainy across the system. Anybody that could move wood have the opportunity. And so I just -- I think the overall weather dynamics probably mitigated some of that impact. But even now across the system in the South, I would say inventory levels are moderate to low. And so from a pricing perspective, we would expect pricing to be comparable to Q1 as we think about Q2.\nWith respect to the salvage, we don't have a whole out of ownership in that area so really didn't impact us meaningfully anyhow nor do we expect it to. But I think the fact that just because the mill inventories are low, that probably mitigated some of the downward pricing pressure in those areas."]], ["First question I had is on Wood Products, and I recognize it's real hard, especially, in an environment like the current one and the one we've been in the last few months to put a finer point on significantly increased EBIT or EBITDA for this segment, and 1Q versus 4Q, but if you could give us some parameters on it, it would be great. ", ["Yes, George, and as you know it's really hard to quantify overall EBITDA at this point just because of the volatility that we've seen in pricing primarily on lumber and OSB. So hard to quantify there, but as we think about rolling into Q1, there are a few things that I think are really going to be tailwinds for us. So first of all, when you think about what happened in Q4 on the lumber side, you know, we saw lumber prices come down a lot faster than log prices. And so for the majority of the quarter, we were really working through higher cost inventory from logs that we purchased in Q3 and early Q4 and so it takes time for you to work those through the system.\nSo heading into Q1, we'll be operating off of a lower log cost. So that's one thing. Second thing is just around operating rates. You know, those did come down a bit in Q4 and so we would expect those to be better in Q1. We'll have the full Grayling for full Q1. So that will be a benefit as well. And so overall -- and we do think we have some good tailwinds just on those things that are within our control. Additionally, although it's hard to quantify on the pricing side as you're probably aware, we have seen a pickup in lumber prices here just over the last several weeks and so feel like we're getting some momentum on that front as well."]], ["In the South, there's a fair amount of storm wood, obviously from the third quarter storms, a lot of that is in Florida, does that have any kind of effect on when you expect Southern prices to lift or is it immaterial at this juncture? ", ["Yes, thanks George. So with respect to the EWP question, you have customers move around from time to time in the overall mix, that's not really material for Q4 for us. We have a strong customer base so not terribly impactful for us. With respect to the storm damaged wood, I think when you talk about the local geographies where you had some of the damage, there may be some downward pressure here over the spring time period as they salvage some that wood. Those are geographies that we don't have a significant amount of ownership in those areas, so I don't think it'll impact us terribly. But you will see some increase in volume coming into those local markets as they salvage that damaged wood."]], ["And then, is it possible going forward, that we could maybe get a little more color on where the real estate land sales take place and sort of value that you achieve there? ", ["Hey, Mark, this is Russell. I think as you're well aware there's not a lot of real estate sales happening up in the north right now, and so those markets tend to be very quiet until things thawed out and we really get into the late spring and summer season. So as you noted in the third quarter we had a large transaction coming out of Montana, and that's usually when we see transactions coming out of those northern properties in that third and fourth quarter.\nComing into the first quarter, we're going to see more transactions out of the South, and then the west. And those markets are actually still -- you know, have been pretty active. They were really strong coming out of the fourth quarter, and we'll pick up some additional transactions in the first quarter."]], ["Just following up on George's question about the sequential earnings improvement from 4Q to 1Q in Wood Products you know, understanding your OpEx performance in this segment was below expectations last year, is there any reason to think that that $40 million to $50 million in OpEx in Wood Products might be a little front-end loaded or is that just kind of redistributed throughout the course of the year. ", ["Yes, with respect to OpEx, I wouldn't say that that's going to be frontloaded to the first-half of the year. Really, we look at that 40 to 50 over the course of the full-year and are very optimistic that that's achievable, and we'll get that value.\nWith respect to downtime, you know, as you know our primary strategy in Wood Products is to have low-cost operations. And that positions us to run when it may not make sense for others. And if you think about Q4 in particular, when you see the lumber prices coming down much faster than log prices, that does create some noise while you're working through some of that higher cost inventory, but I think as we have got that log price down to a more normalized level coming out at Q4, I think, we're well-positioned. We did take a little bit of downtime primarily just for capital projects in Q4 and adjusted shift postures in a few locations around the holiday time. But generally speaking, we were running in Q4."]], ["And then just on Timberlands, I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of transactions, both in terms of just kind of land available, demand, evaluations.

As far as the transactions, you know, 2018, we saw about $4.5 billion of transactions, and there were two large transactions, the southern transaction you talked about, that's Cato [ph] transaction, then we had the PotlatchDeltic deal. And so if you removed those we had about $2 billion of transactions kind of coming through the system. And that's probably kind of an average year anywhere from $2 billion to 3 billion, and then once in a while you get a larger transaction to skew that a little bit.\nSo the overall transaction flow is still pretty strong. As far as valuations are concerned, again, it's difficult to do a comparable analysis, unless you really understand kind of what are some of the constraints on the lands you know, fiber supply agreements can cause some constraints and then also stocking levels, location to markets, et cetera. And so, looking at the values, it really is important to understand what are those impediments to value relative to what we'd consider a prime plantation or a strong industrial Timberland value."]], ["It seemed like last year, we saw one kind of big transaction in the South it came in a little bit of a lower dollar per acre, maybe skewed kind of the average prices a little bit lower.

", ["Yes, so let me have -- I'll answer the capital question first as we've said, our plan has been, we've been spinning $300 million a year, the last several years, we're dropping that down to $270 million this year in Wood Products, it'll probably be comfortable next year. And as we work our way down to a more normalized call it $250 million level, so that sort of what we think is kind of a long-term run rate for capital spend in the Wood Products business.\nWith respect to OpEx, we're certainly going to go after the 80 to 100 this year. It's a little early for me to try to quantify the exact amount beyond that but I am very confident that we'll get through 2019, we will get these OpEx numbers and there's still plenty to get as we continue to focus on cost and reliability throughout the system. So\nI wouldn't want anyone to take the belief that after 2019, we're done with OpEx. It's really become cultural on the organization. So I would anticipate us continuing to drive OpEx improvement well into the future."]], ["And then, just sticking kind of with Timberland on that front, on the west coast, it sounds like on balance, you believe kind of log pricing in the region is bottoming, Is that fair? ", ["Yes. So with respect to your first question, yes, I think that is fair, we've seen that bottom out, would expect to see some upward momentum as we get into the spring building season. With respect to Japan, that trades at some premium to domestic prices. And so, those two are correlated and, not necessarily always one-to-one, but there is a correlation. So when you see domestic pricing come down in the West, you'll typically see that the realizations for the Japan logs comedown as well. So it's really just more tied to the domestic market pricing than it is to demand in Japan."]], ["But I think you referenced that you thought that Chinese construction and infrastructure activity was still strong which I thought was interesting because there certainly been other commentary maybe not quite as bullish on that. ", ["Yes. So couple of things, so on the Japan side, the demand has been solid. We are still seeing solid demand from the Japanese market for a higher quality Japan logs. The pricing and that was the comment earlier -- the pricing came down just a little bit. But that was really more driven by there is a correlation to domestic pricing. In China, what I would say is that we are seeing solid construction activity and good demand pull.\nWhen you think about over the last half of 2018, we did see a bit of a dip when the tariffs were originally put in place. That had largely normalized at least from a demand and volume perspective off of the West Coast for us as we got into the fourth quarter. And so, we are still expecting the overall volume to China to be comparable to prior quarters in that business at this tariff level still seems to be solid."]], ["I think your outlook indicates Western log prices will fall sequentially in 4Q, but even with that, it seems like Western prices are still going to be significantly above where they were say at the end of '16, but I think the segment EBITDA guidance is expected to be down maybe 10%, 15% versus where you were at the end of '16.\nI guess this is cost-driven.

I would say on a year-over-year basis, if you think about the logging side as probably around 3%ish cost inflation year-over-year.\nOn the trucking side and this is more across the business as a whole, it's closer to 7% or 8% and that's largely driven just by contractor and trucking availability and some fuel price inflation as well and I would say, we're doing everything we can to do battle that inflationary headwind with our OpEx and certainly that's a big part of how we are operating really business wide, not just in the West."]], ["Thanks for the details and Doyle, congratulations to you and Devon and Adrian and Keith on the transition and the best of luck to everyone.\nI guess my first question on wood products, can you comment at all in terms of how production might run relative to shipments in the fourth quarter?

What I would tell you George, in the fourth quarter versus the third, I would actually anticipate our volumes would improve.\nIn lumber for example, our operating rates in the third quarter were in the high 80s versus where they were in the second quarter, which was the mid-90s that was a result of all the disruptions we saw from weather and primarily in the South in the third quarter.\nSo as we move into the fourth quarter George, we would anticipate operating rates returning to more normalized levels. So that's how we're currently thinking about it."]], ["I know you guys have set the dividend at a level where you think it's supported regardless of environment and do you think that's probably one of those components that would factor in there.\nJust last one for me, if lumber price is down, just wondering how you think that might impact either it be it prices, I know there is not a direct correlation per se there, but they did sort of compete with each other in some applications. ", ["Yeah, so EWP prices as we mentioned were actually up a little bit in the quarter that's a result of the price increase that we went -- that we put in earlier this year. So as you said, there is no direct tie between EWP prices. Those are done -- those price increases are set and implement over an annual basis, whereas lumber as we know it's price is determined every day.\nSo at some point if you said there was a significant change in overall demand for lumber and/or EWP that could have an impact on pricing, but right now we anticipate prices will be steady for the balance of this year and into next year for EWP."]], ["And then just follow-up, going a little bit back to Anthony's question earlier, just as part -- a bit surprised by the Timberland guidance for 4Q just given that I would be a really multiyear low contribution from that segment, I get in the response some of the questions that you have this optimism as far as pricing recovering on the log front as we kind of move through 4Q, but just in terms of what you're seeing real time if you will, is pricing stabilizing? ", ["Yeah so what I would say is that we still have reasonably high levels of inventory across the mill set in the West and so we're really just at the point now where we're starting to move into the rainy season here in the West and so that's going to take a little time for that to work its way through.\nI would expect you're going to continue to see the inventories at high level for the next several weeks and then as we get into the back half of Q4, I think you'll start to see that normalize and so I think we're still at a point where that's working its way through the supply demand dynamic getting back into balance, that will improve I think over the back half of the quarter.\nAnd that domestic pricing that certainly is correlated to the export pricing as well. So those things typically move more or less in tandem."]], ["No, I was just to say Doyle, I think a lot of us have kind of been assuming would at least get the 15 or 16, but if you look at the data over the last three or four months, it's not what it's showing us.

Again I think that's a confluence of events that just happen to fall in the same part and push prices down in the third quarter into the fourth quarter, but under your assumption of 1.3 million housing starts, I think this company in the way we're positioned and are focused on cost can generate a significant amount of cash flow and would be very comfortable with the dividend level on a go-forward basis."]], ["I was wondering if you could talk about capital allocation, are there properties out there in the market that are potentially good value, are there parts of our portfolio that could be augmented through acquisition or Russell talked about your share repurchases in July.

We will also look for growth opportunities.\nAnthony and as we said, those would be primarily in Timberland where we will be very disciplined in finding opportunities that we think create incremental shareholder value on a go forward basis.

So that\u2019s kind of how we think about Japan."]], ["How do you think about the cyclicality of the real estate business these days and how these obviously strong, but I\u2019m trying to get a handle on how much of a secular tailwind, do you think you have in that business.

We do have some tie-in but it\u2019s just a cyclical nature of the housing market as we see some of our properties go into more - sold to developers, but a lot of our real estate activity is driven by higher and better uses of recreational uses, conservation uses, alternatives to commercial type timber operations.\nSo while we do see a little bit of that. I think the overall trend really sits with the availability of discretionary spending from the buy side, we are seeing strong markets in the South and in the West for the for our real estate program."]], ["I wanted to start out just a couple of questions around North American volumes and maybe a follow-up about your last comment on, Jim around units, but just in the quarter, with volumes a bit weak it seems like on the major appliance side a little below what [indiscernible] said, and then I think we all were expecting some rebound in small appliance shipments, just given the timing shifts you had indicated last quarter. ", ["So Mike, it's Marc Bitzer. So let me comment on the NA -- volume in Q4, which as you know, in total, we reported a 3.8% unit decline for North America. Now, keep in mind, first of all pure majors business and if you want to take one indication, the AM numbers were minus 1.8 for the quarter, which just remind everybody does not encompass the entire spectrum of what we sell, but that's of course one part of that. If you look at the pure majors business we approximately held market share in Q4, so we feel pretty good about where we offer market share and then particularly during promotional period.\nOn the other parts of the business, keep in mind, Canada is in there. Canada continues to have a market decline and Canadian market itself that might has an impact. On the SDA volume, frankly, coming into the quarter, we did expect that the trade brings inventories back to normal levels around the end of the year and they did, so the trade inventories on the SDA are lower than the year before, but we feel very good about the sell proof KitchenAid SDA, which is pretty solid and pretty stable. So these are pretty much of a major components, and maybe Jim you want to comment again on the units reporting.\nJim Peters\nYes, Mike. And then on the units reporting, as I mentioned, as we look at our business globally, there are a lot of parts of the world where services and other consumables products that aren't normally included in our unit count or increase -- an increasing part of our sales. So we've typically looked at a unit is something that has a power cord attached to it and a lot more of the stuff that we sell now today, whether it'd be stand mix or attachments it be, licensed products it be, as I mentioned consumables or services just don't fall into there and so we felt that it was a much less relevant indicator while revenues is a better indicator of how we're doing on a global basis."]], ["There's been a lot of chatter and concern as there always is perpetually but given the past year with the ramp of the LG and Samsung lines, we've gotten a lot of questions around how that may or may not have affected the competitive dynamics.

There are almost the perennial question, so i.e., there has been around for last 10 years and in the last 10 years we expanded our margin on consistent based in North America. So we of course it's an intense competitive environment, but I think we've also impressively demonstrated that we can expand margins despite a highly competitive environment. In particular, when it comes to be onshoring of the two Washing Machine factories as we always said, we welcome that because it's managed a level playing field and we feel very confident that we can compete embedded environment. So as such no with a negative impact on the broader competitive environment from the onshoring of that production. I would say pretty much the same intense environment.\nParticularly related to your question on the promotional environment. Yes, in Q4, we saw a slight uptick on the promotion intensity particularly from two competitors, but not the entire marketplace. And that doesn't entirely surprise us, but you've also seen that despite a broader market contraction. We delivered 13.3% EBIT margin in North America which demonstrate that even in a promotional environment, even in a declining markets we are able to deliver very, very strong margins."]], ["If you could give us any sense of perhaps just being a lot more granular around the drivers of that 150 basis point year-over-year improvement in particular, obviously you have the price mix component, and I'm also curious about cost productivity, what's driving that bucket and what was the contributor there particularly as obviously you don't have any additional volume leverage to take advantage of. ", ["Yes Michael, this is Jim, let me maybe start a little bit with that. I'd say for North America, the margin expansion was driven by similar levers to what we said globally. And so there's not a significant difference there. We did obviously have positive price and mix within North America within this quarter. From a net cost perspective, we also began to see some cost progression there and what we're seeing is one and as we talked about going into 2020, a reduction in headwinds in terms of what we're seeing on materials, tariffs were very stable within the quarter. So that was positive for us and then we did make some investments similar to what you see on our walk for the whole quarter. So there's nothing unusual within North America outside of what we demonstrated globally that it was really pricing and mix and then a positive cost environment that offset some of the cost headwinds we had to deal with."]], ["And then my second question, the net cost benefit of 50 basis points in 2020 that's obviously constructive but I think it's still below where you'd like to be ideally at least from a productivity standpoint. ", ["I can take that Sam. First of all on full year base, as you point out, we're certainly not planning and we're not net cost takeout to have benefit from volume leverage or put it differently, we're not going to increase production beyond the sales forecast. We actually contrary -- we're planning to take out further inventory we have some opportunity. However, I would say that is not a huge item in there, I mean it's a small negative in the cost takeout efforts, but the other element is, we still have -- we still have logistic cost which are elevated throughout the world and that is still a factor. The good news is, we're making good progress on the fixed cost takeout in Europe and some other parts. We see some benefit from our global product architecture. So it's all coming to materialize. And yes, internally our job over time is to tackle even more, particularly the supply chain and logistic costs."]], ["So the first one would be just trying to understand what is driving the view that North America demand or unit demand will be higher this year versus last, given things like a replacement cycle and housing obviously being late stage, and I think your commentary that we haven't seen much of a push up from that. ", ["So Curtis, let me -- again North America, first of all, to repeat the numbers, we expect North America industry to be somewhere between minus 1% and plus 1%. So pretty much flat year-over-year. As you know, they are basically simplified by two major components in the industry demand. One is the replacement demand we have which is somewhat related to housing or remodeling. On the replacements, and that's a little bit the same like last year, we're now comping against the low years post-recession and that has been around for the last one or two years and probably will be around us for another year or so. And that's just because you're comping against these low years. And [indiscernible] already effect in 2019.\nComing into 2019, frankly, we expected more momentum coming out of housing and of course the -- and then again we're not going back in time Q4 '18 weak housing impacted what we sold in the housing rate of the market in 2019. From a housing model, I would say, a little bit of a softer side compared to what we originally expected coming into 2019. As you turn the page, in 2020, I would say, we're reasonably optimistic on housing, but we still want to wait and see. What I mean with that is the initial data points which we got in December from housing were in fact very encouraging. But it's the first positive data points and we want to see that stabilizing.\nI would also add when you look at the news from homebuilders, these were in fact very strong, very encouraging signs. But I also want to remind everybody is between an order of our new house and the actual client shipments, you typically have nine to 12 months. So good signs which we see now on the order side, it takes a while until it shows up in our revenue line. So but I would say if housing stabilizes and seize more positive trends that we've seen in December. I would say that spells with news for our industry and for us."]], ["Regarding you've got negative North American units, the working capital certainly was below the guide that you discussed on the October call yet revenues were generally flat and you put up some pretty impressive margins.

Certainly on the two products which we've just shown on top-load and dishwasher. Dishwasher platform architect which we have almost 10 years old. So I mean bringing in such an architecture with such great features next should open opportunities for some share growth, and I'm not talking about promotional share growth, I'm talking about structural share growth in a healthy business.\nSo yes, we have certain ambition for share growth in North America. Related to your question about retailers, yes, it's obvious that the kind of windfall which came out of Sears decline for many other retailers that has diminished. I mean, that's based on existing. But right now, I would say, it's a reasonably stable retail environment of home improvement having a strong growth in home appliances best by being very well established, but also some other good regional players. So I think it's -- right now, we don't see the dramatic moves across the retail landscape. We've seen some ins and outs when it comes to inventory management of retailers. And I think you all have seen that in the AM shipment data in October and then subsequent in December, so there has been some moves which of course impacts us and our entire supply chain, but beyond this one, we don't see dramatic moves across the different retailers."]], ["I'm wondering if you might be able to anticipate, I mean if the result -- If the revenue is down, I mean how are you guys going to go about kind of explaining this -- what type of communication could we expect to hear from you absent that those data points just so none of us get caught by surprise you all or us in terms of if results are better worse just so we can properly interpret it.

First thing is there'll still be obviously industry data out there that will give an indication of which direction the industry is going from a North America perspective now that it's really two key markets and the biggest one being the U.S. Currency also doesn't play a big difference within there. So as I said, I don't think that whether we disclose units or not within the North America business will make a significant difference because the couple big variables that are ready drive that are out there. Obviously, we will talk about how we believe we're doing from a share perspective and then what the benefits of price and mix and we'll continue to talk about that on a go-forward basis which also is an indicator of revenues versus what unit performance is doing."]], ["And I was curious if you could kind of drill down a little bit in terms of the drivers of that improvement, if it was all effectively price/mix or if there were some other drivers there? ", ["Yes. Michael, this is Jim. And let me kind of start off here, and then Marc will add some more commentary to this, too. But as we look at North America, again it was a very strong quarter. We are seeing continuing benefits of many of the price increases that we have taken, as well as mix coming from recent product launches and all that. So that\u2019s one of the bigger drivers that we see. Obviously, cost has been a headwind within North America, whether it was material costs that have started to moderate some, but tariffs continue to be a year-over-year cost increase, as well as we\u2019ve talked about freight costs. So we have been able to offset that, obviously, with the price increases we took. But also, as we said, the mix of our business is very healthy. In terms of the competitive environment, what I would say is through Labor Day, we did see some increased levels of competition, again not outside our level of normal and not outside of what we expected. As we look toward the Black Friday holiday period, that will obviously be an indicator of where things are and all that. But as we have said in the past, we do participate in promotions when we see that they create value. And right now, I think we have had a very good track record within the North America business of continuing to balance margins versus the promotional periods.\nMarc Bitzer\nYes. Michael, it\u2019s Marc. Maybe a bit additional color I want to give on North America. At the end of the day, not just Q3 but the entire year, this is an environment where frankly we do not get a lot of help from the outside. I mean the industry demand has been pretty much moving sideways entire year. We have cost inflation and tariffs and logistic costs. To your point, the LG and Samsung, we are fully in production, and yet we delivered 12.8% EBIT margin, which basically tells me no matter how you look at the North America business, this business is in a really, really good shape and we have very strong momentum, and we have a lot of confidence for that business."]], ["Right now, as you kind of look at the business plus or minus breakeven, I was hoping you \u2013 given you\u2019re another quarter or two into the turnaround and you laid out some of the plans at your analyst day, if you could kind of just remind us of how we should think about the next year or two in terms of the next two or three steps that are right in front of you in terms of driving improved profitability for the region. ", ["Yes. Michael, this is Jim. I\u2019ll start off with that. And I think the way you need to look at it is we talked about the actions earlier, and Marc talked about these and we talked about them on investor day. Remember, those were implemented this yes. So you have carryover going into next year of benefits of that, of us being out of Turkey, of us having disposed of the South Africa business and of the cost takeout. You\u2019ll see a continued level of cost takeout within the EMEA business. Again, just because we\u2019ve done a lot of the big actions, it doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have a lot of other things we\u2019re focusing on there to continue to adjust our costs. But also then, we talk about the 5% core growth within that business, and we do expect that to continue into next year as we gain back share in some of the countries where we lost it. So again, we \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a balance next year of cost takeout with an incremental volume coming in due to a stability of that business."]], ["There is a fair amount of confusion though as to why that tailwind is only moderate based on what we can see obviously with the steel markets and copper and aluminum and what have you. ", ["Sam, it\u2019s Marc. Let me maybe try to take this one. First of all, as a reminder, on both steel and in particular base metals, as you know, we try to either buy very long or hedge as much as we can within our policies and guidelines. So by definition, the flip side means we never buy at spots. The spot barely impacts us. And in particular, during times of elevated raw material prices, usually we have quite a bit of a discount in our books versus the spot rate. So as such, yes, what you\u2019re probably referring to are the spots are coming down, and we see that. But again, it\u2019s \u2013 we bought below the spot, and our full-year costs are below spot prices. Having said that, we are certainly encouraged by the trends \u2013 certainly encouraged by momentum in raw materials, you may also know that the big steel contracts, they should really get negotiated toward the end of the year, early next year. And I think the current momentum puts us in a good shape, a good position toward these contract negotiations. But we will not know until end of January. We have a big, and that typically moves a little bit faster, element in raw materials. It\u2019s plastics. With plastics, you can\u2019t go out long. We will typically buy quarterly or even shorter term because you simply cannot go long. So any volatility you may have on oil prices ultimately, in most cases, reflects back on volatility on the plastics. And that is still a little bit in uncertainty even though that was certainly good guide for us in 2019."]], ["And on the website, you have posted what List 4 and a step-up if it happens, in Lists 1, 2 and 3 could mean on a monthly basis, but given your earlier commentary around just the carryover effect into 2020, can you just quantify how much is truly incremental to 2020 if we consider all current implemented tariffs and then the proposed increases and/or List 4? ", ["Yes. Mike, it\u2019s Marc. So again, to your point, there is the element of already implemented tariffs where we have a certain carryover. As you may recall, at the beginning of the year, we talked roughly about $10 million every month, and now we talk about in the range of $12 million to $14 million, also depending on how much volume we have and how much you import. So put a number behind the carryover, it\u2019s probably around $20 million, but we can provide more details. Maybe a little bit more. But then you have the additional element of tariffs announced but not implemented. And right now, as it is prudent, we have to take that into account, and that is an additional element of a small headwind. But we, of course, all recognize there is uncertainty around the actual implementation and of course, at the end of January, we will know more."]], ["The -- I recognize and see that your confidence in getting it not only stabilized but rightsized remains we're looking though at a little bit of a lower margin guide for the year. ", ["So Sam, it\u2019s Marc. First of all I would not make it reliant on the marketplace. The marketplace in Europe is reasonably solid but we're not counting on a massive market increase. The reason why we're confident is ultimately coming back to be actions which we took. As you know, we took significant fixed cost out. We exited South Africa or sold South Africa, exited Turkey, small domestic Hotpoint business and we put a strong focus on driving core volume growth.\nAs a result of that now in Q2, we saw some improvement year-over-year in sequential but frankly not yet to the level where we want to be. So it's largely dependent now on solidifying the core volume growth. As you may recall in the investor meeting, we said you should expect 5% to 6% core volume growth on the remaining business and we keep 3% which there is a small detail is largely driven by our Middle East business was a bit soft in Q2, which should recover end of Q3. So it ultimately comes back to, Sam, our organic core volume growth needs to be 5% on top of all of the actions which I described. And then we will see both sequential and year-over-year improvement in our European business."]], ["I guess I wanted to ask a little bit about you mentioned some issues in North America outside the U.S., if you could give a little bit of further thoughts on your share position in the U.S. ", ["Megan, its, Marc. First of all, good morning. First of all, from the scope, as you know, this change reporting last year in North America, it's U.S. and Canada two years ago it still included Mexico, it\u2019s really U.S. and Canada. First of all for me overall I mean obviously with Q2, a 12.4% margin we feel very good about North America business, very strong traction, and the impacts from our pricing actions.\nWe feel good about our share position. If you just do the math and as you always know, it's a little bit tricky between the T6 AM or T7 and our overall business but we feel very good of our share position both year-over-year. So we feel good.\nThe weakness right now is more industry related in Canada. Canada year-to-date is a fairly soft market environment. And we are overall market leader in Canada. So of course you feel it to some extent. So if you want to point to any remote weakness in our North America business probably more industry-related Canada but the U.S. business is in very solid shape."]], ["And obviously you can't comment on what your pricing actions are going to be in the future but typically in an environment where commodity pressures are easing, would you expect to see pricing come down. ", ["Yes, so Megan, so first of all as we mentioned in our statements before, we feel very good about our pricing actions in North America not just about the fact that we took them but how they were executed, so we didn't lose mix, we feel really good about how the team overall executed them.\nWith that in mind to your question of course it's pure speculation about what happens going forward and we don't comment on this one but I would like to remind that our pricing actions were cost based pricing actions. The cumulative effects just for the last two years was $600 million to $700 million raw material increase. But just because we now see a small moderation of raw materials and maybe scenario where it gets more to a zero increase, doesn't change the fact that we had $600 million or $700 million cost increase cumulative. So for us, the need for change, that doesn't change anything about, we had to do pricing and we would hold on."]], ["First I was just wondering if you could help us think about margin expansion potential for 3Q and if there is some potential impact from any further need to reduce production volume in the remainder of the year and how much of that you're able to work through in 2Q? ", ["Yes. So this is Jim and I'd say if you look at 3Q, we expect our EBIT margin expansion and our cost takeout to be similar to what we've seen year-to-date and then kind of what we've guided to for the full-year. So it's not going to be dissimilar from any of the previous quarters here.\nI think the one piece you asked on the inventory reduction, what I will say is that that it'll have a slight impact on the third quarter but we also had some of that in the third quarter last year. And additionally as you look at when we talked about our net cost and you look at what we forecasted last quarter for the full-year versus this quarter for the full-year that does reflect the impact of some of the -- it reflects the impact of needing to reduce production volumes in the third quarter. In addition, it just increased levels of logistics costs and other costs we're seeing outside of materials.\nMarc Bitzer\nLet me maybe just make the additional comment. So, as you know, we don't give quarterly margin guidance. We guide the year now 6.8% which again was at the very high-end of a previous range. We just finished Q2 with 7.0%. So I would say in the 6.8% always moving parts being inventory and marketing investments that fully factored in and given the run rate where we are, we feel very confident about the 6.8% on a full-year basis."]], ["I think what might have been asked is in terms of how you think about forward assumptions for restructuring costs next year and the year after which I think were somewhere around about $75 million to $100 million ballpark.

We did add the Naples facility to this which brought it from the $100 million to the $200 million. And as we get past that now it'll just be looking at specific opportunities as they come up. But there's nothing that we've identified. But we do expect to identify some opportunities on a go-forward basis but they will be in that $75 million to $100 million range and then below the $200 million that we're seeing this year and we've seen in the prior years."]], ["And then, if you can comment on the year-on-year margin expansion for the second half if you can maybe make some comments around price mix and cost productivity given that you're going to be anniversarying, I think your pricing in laundry, although you'll still be benefiting from other price increases. ", ["Alvaro let me maybe first take the first one in North America industry. Again we revised the industry guidance at the last earnings call from minus 2 to zero. And right now what we've seen in Q2 is kind of April started very soft from selling perspective and May started recovery and June was we finally saw some growth. Our expectation is that scenario pretty much will continue to Q3 and Q4 i.e. we will see a small, not very significant but we will see small growth in both sell-in and sell-through. And while we all saw our sell through data which, as you know, is non-public data and we get it from some of our retailers points to reasonably solid end of Q2 and that gives us the overall confidence that the industry will stabilize the back half and we're right now in fact towards that full-year guidance.\nJimPeters\nAnd then talking about your question on the EBIT margin improvement, and you are correct, because if you look at we saw within the second quarter 2.5% margin improvement from pricing and mix and obviously now that all the price increases that we've taken in the prior year have been run in. If you look at the full-year and what we're forecasting and while it's better than we would have said last quarter for the full-year we're still at 1.75% margin improvement for the full-year. So it does imply that in the back half of the year, it's not as big of a benefit. But however for the full-year it is a very strong benefit from a pricing perspective pricing and mix perspective.

", ["Yes, Mike there's a couple of things in there. One EMEA will be a big part of it. And as we talked about we expect the EMEA margins to begin to improve significantly throughout the back half of the year. And a big part of that is the cost reduction efforts that we've done within EMEA and so we'll start to see the benefits of those. Additionally, when we look year-over-year, we really saw the logistics costs within the U.S. become elevated especially in the back half of last year. And so it's -- while it's a headwind in aggregate on a year-over-year basis in the back half of the year, it's not as big of a headwind as it was before.\nAnd then additionally, there are other cost reduction efforts that we've put in place across the globe just in light of some of the recent inflation that we've seen and that will take effect. So it's a basket of different things but those are the big drivers."]], ["Is there anything we should read into as raw materials deflate, I understand not wanting to get forward-looking commentary around pricing and great pricing performance so far, but is there going to be some reinvestment of cost tailwinds into the marketing side. ", ["Michael, it's Marc. So first of all I would not create a linkage between raw material and marketing investments. We have over the last couple of years steadily increased our marketing investment to support the new product launches. We have regional specific initiatives like for example, in China, where we invest in brands and brand building but that is -- these are long-term investments against the multiyear strategic plan. So they are not driven by what happens every driven quarter by raw material.\nOn the raw materials itself and I can read through it what I commented before, yes, we see a moderation. But keep in mind even the first half was up. So we see a little moderation going forward but that's against a backdrop that we had $600 million to $7000 million increase over the last two years. So the fundamentals about being significantly elevated compared to 2015 has not changed and therefore we don't take any dramatic action in our direction because the fact is still the same.\nNow and again as I mentioned before forward-looking statements about pricing, we don't do it and it's pure speculation. The promotional environment in Q2 in retrospect I wouldn't describe as fundamentally different than Q1. So this is a highly competitive environment. Our promotional strategy has not changed. We participate when we think we can create value and if not we don't. So that has not dramatically changed and we don't see it right now."]], ["If you're getting that and you're neutral to that or your higher margins would suggest actually you're doing better; is that -- when you talk about price recovery, price relative to the cost inflation. ", ["So Ken, this is Marc. Let me try to answer your question. First of all what I want to re-emphasize of course our overall results are very dependent on the North America performance.\nBut one aspect which I also want to highlight for Q2 is we had margin expansion in three out of four regions. So of course in absolute terms North America was the star. But we had margin expansion in three out of four regions which gives us a good sense.\nOn your point about pricing again right now we have pricing which is above the total cost increases which we have and we feel very good about the execution to your point, it's not just the like-for-like increase which we did based on the raw material cost increases. The new product launches not only in North America but throughout the world really helped us manage mix very well. And what you see right now is very much to your point, it's a combination of the carryover benefit of like-for-like increases and very good mix management across all regions. And that's also opportunity going forward. We have good products, new innovative product launches which justify the price in the marketplace."]], ["This is not a setup question, Marc, but I think what continues to be a drag obviously I mean the movie Jerry Maguire Show Me The Money, to the extent Europe is having this $100 million headwind and your free cash flow. ", ["Yes, Ken, and this is Jim and I'll kind of start-off and take that and then let Marc add any commentary. I think as we look at -- I think the additional $100 million you're talking about is the additional restructuring that we've added and obviously those are projects within EMEA. Now what we do expect is at once we complete all that and we've begun to improve the margins within EMEA, now we'll begin to see significant cash generation coming from increased earnings within EMEA.\nAdditionally, as I mentioned earlier from an inventory perspective within EMEA, we are beginning to see benefits as we begin to get our inventories in line with our sales levels and normalize our production levels there. So from -- well, we don't give regional cash performance perspective. What I will say is that once we get past this restructuring, EMEA is moving to become part of a positive cash generator.\nNow for the full-year again as you said we've got a big turn in the back half of the year here. If we look at last year or we look at this year within the first half of this year, we've had some significant one-off type items such as the French anti-Competition Authority payment that we had to make and some large tax payments we had to make on some of the gains that we carved out of our ongoing earnings. And we don't have those in the back half of the year and so we'll see a significant generation of cash within the back half of the year. And if you think about last year in the back half of the year, we made a $350 million pension contribution. So when you're looking at it year-over-year, there's a big -- our back half of this year was significantly better than last year's second half.\nMarc Bitzer\nYes, Ken, maybe just close that and add to Jim's comments that, as you know we don't give recent cash numbers or guidance. But to echo what Jim was referring to. If you look at the European cash flow the ins-on numbers, you would see more confidence and improvement than you right now see in earning. So take that as an early and a positive leading indicator. But we see it in the cash flow and we'll continue to focus on this one.\nMarc Bitzer\nSo let me maybe just wrap up here. And I'm now referring to Page 18 and I'm not going to go through all of the bullet points on Page 18 but just to re-emphasize what we said in our prepared remarks and also in Q&A. Obviously we feel very good about our ongoing momentum in the business. What we have achieved in the first half, our perspective in full-year and that allowed us to raise the guidance fairly significantly by $0.75 on the bottom and $0.50 on the high-end. So we feel very good about the business not only in North America but in many parts of the world.\nNorth America stands out in a what I would describe still a fairly soft environment in North America. We achieved a very, very strong performance on the margin but even on the top-line level.\nWe feel confident about Europe slowly coming around. We always have certain amount of impatience about how quickly can come around. But I think we start seeing the traction of the actions which we put in place and that should set us up much better for the back half and for next year.\nAnd finally, we completed the sale of Embraco which as you know was long works but it had significant helps us now addressing our debt level and we feel confident towards reaching that famous gross debt to EBITDA target of 2.0 by the year-end. So overall, we feel very good about our business. We remain focused on delivering Q3 and Q4 in line with what you all have in mind and as a continuation of a very strong first half.

", ["David, it\u2019s Marc. Let me just take this question. So I'm not exactly sure, which 800 basis points you\u2019re referring to. First of all, again a) is the average sales value is not necessarily what we would refer to what margin impact coming from price/mix.\nSo our price/mix overall in terms of margin impact was significantly positive. It's been one of the strongest we ever record as company. It's deemed as a title, not only North America, but also \u2013 regions and across most categories. That is ultimately still reflection of \u2013 as you know, we have cumulative significant material cost increases over two years in the tune of $650 million and we had several rounds of cost-based price increases. As you know, I can't give a forward-looking statement of pricing, but the need for us in terms of mitigating this cumulative material costs impact is still there.\nYes, we've got a little bit of relief, small relief on the increase in material cost, but the fundamental cost inflation is still in place. And we executed what we had to do from a price increase. And I would say our team has done a very good job in managing these price increases.\nI would also like to emphasize with all the new product introductions, we have opportunities for price/mix. We've done that so far. And I think there is more price/mix opportunity, particularly with the new products coming out there, which should help us on a full-year basis."]], ["First question, I just want to make sure because there \u2013 we\u2019ve got some questions last night, this morning around the inventory levels and appreciate the guidance and the thoughts around there.

Having said that, we guided the full-year North America was 12% plus EBIT margin, and starting the year with Q1 was 12.3%. I would probably say we're somewhere between confident and very confident on the 12% plus.\nOkay, that's a reality, and I don't think you should expect any irregular or abnormal move than any of the quarter for the year. So we see that right now and we've demonstrated that over last year, a very steady, very strong performance. So any kind of inventory moves are baked in, in this one, and we have a comment I want to make on the inventories. Let's not take without a proportion.\nSo year-over-year, our Company inventories are down. That\u2019s a good starting point. But I think you've seen it also over the last two years, we've been very disciplined in managing our working capital. That was a big part of our cash flow story.\nAnd we want \u2013 at the moment, we see even a slight increase of inventory versus where we want to have, we will adjust it. So it is not a big, a massive move, but it's something which we will do in Q2. And as such, you should not see a big impact on the margin, but more steady margin also on a sequential basis.\nJames Peters\nYes, I mean Michael, this is Jim. I think as Marc pointed out, if you look at our overall working capital, last year we were close to as a percentage of sales on net working capital at 7% in Q1 and now we're closer to 4.5%. If you look at our cash flow statement, you see we built an incremental $100 million of inventory this year versus last year. And that's really indicative of the amount that we look to get out sooner in the second quarter here. So not a massive amount, but an amount that we're very focused on, reducing in the near-term."]], ["So just want to get a sense then when you say that to clarify, I guess that first quarter \u2013 I'm sorry, second quarter North American margins to be similar to a year-ago that's about 40 basis points of a sequential decline.\nAre we to take it that that is the full impact of the inventory drawdown or the reduction in inventory, the reduced production levels, and perhaps you can just give a sense of what are some of the pluses and minuses there, because obviously you had a strong 90 bps year-over-year improvement?

", ["Yes, Michael, it's Marc. So again, let me maybe also put that in context. Obviously, we haven't made a loss in Europe for last several quarters. Our key are \u2013 80% or 70% of our focus is on the operational levers to turnaround the business.\nAnd that has been largely around recovering volume, doing additional restructuring actions, exiting Turkey, domestic markets and the small domestic appliance on the Hotpoint-brand and potentially selling the South Africa business.\nAll of these actions on track, but not completed. I would say probably with the exception of South Africa, most of these ones will be completed for our Q2. So I feel good about where we are from an operational turnaround.\nAnd as Jim indicated and as we repeatedly said, we expect the full-year in Europe to breakeven are 0% to 1% operating margin and we expect to exit Q2 with a number which is close to breakeven. So I would say from an operation perspective on track.\nWe've also \u2013 why we're doing these operational priorities, we have redefined our strategy for Europe last year, and that is starting to take place. We would put several actions in place and that is largely around \u2013 focused around how we regain lost market share in particular from a kitchen business, which is a very profitable business and how we can further mix up the business. Now we always said these strategies take longer to implement, but I feel good about where we are from first step.\nNow with all of that in mind, we lost time against this famous 8% targets. We lost probably two years. And that's just what we lost. So we still believe the business is structured capable of delivering 8% EBIT margin, but we as evidenced by some competitors. So this industry in Europe can deliver 8% EBIT margin. But we lost time.\nOn the exact time line about what we expect the mid-term and long-term, I would actually ask Mike, we will give an update at our Investor Day in New York, so we will show you both the mid-term targets and the long-term targets, but long-term target will be 8%, but we'll give you more specific timeline about what we expect over the next two or three years."]], ["I guess first how much we're volumes down and look I mean, I guess if things don't progress, I know you are going through a transition in terms of brands, if you don't stretch us in progress, what would you consider exiting the market? ", ["So Curtis, this is Marc. So first of all, as you indicated China was a soft Q1 and obviously in our overall Asia numbers, but shows unit down 10%. That is a reflection of India, Southeast Asia, but including Hong Kong, there's a very strong performance in Q1, strong market share, strong EBIT performance, but China was soft. But China soft you really alluded to a branch transfer. I would first start with the market environment.\nAs you know the market data in China and not a 100% accurate always and become a certain delay, but right now it's fair to assume it, but China market in total was high single-digit down or low double-digit down. So we saw a significant market softness, which doesn't make it easier. We are in the mist of the branch transfer and that will be with us for a number of years, and we saw very strong growth of Whirlpool brand, but we of course tend the opposite effect on the Sanyo brand, which is coming down.\nSo the net effect between industry brand transfer. We had significant volumes down in China. We are committed to do a brand transfer. That's why you've also seen in significant more investments in brand advertising in China in Q1 and you will see that going forward. So we are committed to make this brand transfer successful.\nAnd keep all this in mind when we talk about China, China as far as a very important production base. We've produced microwave pretty much throughout the world. We have a very sophisticated and strong four-door refrigerator coming out of China. We have more and more exports. So China is for us beyond the domestic market, which of course it's challenging, I agree. It's a very important and also long-term important production base for us."]], ["And my second question, I think you guys adopted new lease accounting this year, and I was hoping you could give us a little more detail on what, if any impact it had on the P&L? ", ["Yes. So if you step back, Mike and listen and look, lease accounting was a U.S. wide change that was made to the accounting rules that you had to adopt by now. And effectively, you put all your leases now on your balance sheet rather than having in this off balance sheets. So we put over $800 million on our balance sheet that that offsets \u2013 that there's an offset for a future payable on that.\nThe impact of the P&L is nothing, because you were currently flowing that through as a lease expense. You still follow that through in a similar way, still have similar cash payments. It's just the way that you now have to put these on your balance sheet versus you had them off your balance sheet before.\nIn terms of the sundry, what we had within that line is we had a \u2013 we carved this out of ongoing, so it's only in our GAAP results. We had a significant gain in Latin America. On a legal case, we won regarding some operational taxes. So we recognized about an $85 million gain and that's net of income taxes on it and success fees, legal success fees. And again that's carved out, but that sits down in that that interest in sundry line. So again we \u2013 it's nothing that's \u2013 that affects our ongoing results within there."]], ["And I think it just goes to kind of the operating flexibility that the platform might have and no way am I taking obviously anything away from the price strength you've had. ", ["Yes. So Ken, let me maybe try to take that one. And again, we will give a more strategic perspective on North America in Investor Meeting. But just operationally, first of all, I want to emphasize, if you look at North America margins, this has not been a one quarter wonder. We had now very strong margin for an extended period and particularly if you look at the last \u2013 the trailing four quarters, the industry was down. And in North America also even though we don't show regional inventory, over the last four quarter, we took even inventories down in a broader negative industry.\nSo I would say the team has successfully and impressively demonstrated we can expand margins despite these tough environments. So in any given quarter, you have some pluses and minuses of industry, et cetera, but over last four quarters, we have a sustained margin run rate and we're now kind of on 12% or 12% plus. So I feel very good about it. It will be a little bit too easy to just [say that] in Thailand [indiscernible] pricing.\nYes, I feel very, very good about the pricing. The team has done an excellent job in executing price, remaining disciplined, staying focused on value creation for any kind of promotions, so we've done that very well. But we also had our fixed cost base very well intact.\nIn such an environment or particularly two or three years ago, you would have been tempted to expand fixed costs and particularly with strong margin. We were very disciplined in managing the fixed costs, and we will remain so ultimately in the future.\nThe other elements and that in particularly going forward, we are getting better in finding more traction and managing down this massive cost inflation, which again is not just raw materials and tariffs, it is logistic cost and everything else. It's been very painful. We start seeing now, I would say progress in managing these costs down, and of course going forward, we have to turn around the negative cost environment and find actions, which are now controlled to mitigate whatever inflationary pressure we have around us.\nSo in short, I would really emphasize that the cost take out opportunities despite a still broad inflationary environment, which we will add to the equation beyond managing price/mix in a disciplined manner."]], ["When thinking about the overall guidance and the different moving pieces in there from the segment region, I think if you look at it from a segment standpoint there is upside to the numbers. ", ["Yes. And Michael, this is Jim. I think if you step back from it to begin with, as we give the different range on the regions, obviously there is some rounding that comes in there and all that. So, if you take it perfectly, you may get a little bit higher and lower than our overall range. Second is, we believe overall that guidance is set at the appropriate level. And again, as you look at the different regions, I think that is pretty close to where we expect to be. Outside of that, I think it's just rounding and nothing else in there.\nMarc Bitzer\nMichael it's Marc, maybe just elaborate a little bit further. First of all, stepping back on the guidance, and I think that is an important thing to note and recognize. As we said in our prepared remarks, the 2019 guidance for EPS is not fully compatible with 2018, because there is a big element which just comes from what I call a more normalized tax rate of 15% to 20% and the absence of Embraco.\nSo you take these two elements out, that is basic $2.25. So that is, particularly when you look at the broader guidance, is a big element. Underneath that, we are still planning margin expansion, margin expansion on the back of pricing but also recognizing some cost elements.\nSo to Jim's point, I would call our guidance realistic but I think as we have evidenced in Q4 and hopefully what you hear, we are very confident. We are very confident and we are control of all the actions. We delivered good margin and good performance, also from cash flows side in Q4, despite the soft industry.\nSo we are highly confident but I also recognize there is uncertainty, as we experienced in 2018 there are probably going to be volatility in 2019. Right now I think volatility points more toward, call it upside risk i.e. raw material is going in right direction but we all recognize on the currency side on the raw materials, there is still a lot of uncertainty out there and that is what we have appropriately reflected in our guidance. But again, I want to reiterate, we are highly confident in our actions."]], ["I was hoping if you could just talk a little bit about the industry backdrop in North America right now from a mix standpoint, how it's trending?\nOne of the things that we have observed across different building product companies is somewhat of a negative mix shift or strength in lower price points across different building product sectors in 2018. ", ["Michael, it's Marc and let me try to answer that. To your point about the building products and kind of more of the lower end growing, I would say in the pure new housing side I would see yes, there is some trends or some signs, but in particular, the first time buyers are coming more into the market which overall I would see as a good news and its demand which comes with a slightly lower mix.\nBut keep in mind, that it's only a fraction of our total markets, the new housing. On the broader base, we don't see that massive shift down. I actually would say, the broader mix is pretty stable. But then, I would also again point back to what we are doing on product launches and innovation.\nI mentioned in one of my earlier calls, we have, this year, for Whirlpool brand, an entire new global brand language for the kitchen products. We just launched a new front load washer - an entire new front load washer platform in North America. And we will, in Q2, launch an entire new top loader line.\nSo I think we are bringing out a lot of new products with a lot of innovation, which ultimately I think - and that is our job to kind of bring the consumer to buy it and to mix up, and I think we feel very good about what we have in our pipeline."]], ["I guess, having covered you guys for a long time now, this is a pretty strong pricing environment and probably the strongest pricing environment I ever remember seeing with you in 20 years. ", ["David, it's Marc. So, I mean - so yes, you are correct. In 2018, we had a very significant positive price mix for the entire company. I also want to remind everybody; we had also very significant cost inflation out there. So it was a cost-based need and I think that explains a big part. The other part which, and I can't speak for the industry, I can speak for ourselves, we shifted, I would say, several years ago, where we said we will participate in promotion then we believe it creates value for us as company.\nThat policy hasn't changed even under pressure. I think that there is a strong commitment on our side to expand margins. We saw our cost increases reflected appropriately in the product pricing. And on top of that, and again I can't be - stress that enough; we launched a lot of new products.\nWe invest every year $600 million in capital and almost the same amount in engineering and that ultimately pays off. I mean, we feel very good about our product pipeline. There is not a single platform in North America which I, right now would see as behind. We feel very good and that helps us often having these prices stick."]], ["And I'm just wondering if something has changed here with regard to the tariffs, you have got foreign manufacturers adjusting to US cost structures; you truly have an acceleration in new product introductions and innovation going on as well.\nBut the big risk to the 2019 guide seems to be your ability to hold on to pricing in the North American market.

", ["Yes. Sam, this Jim and let me start off, and then Marc can add some color commentary here. I mean the first thing is, we had some of it that was just a shift from marketing and technology to net cost. But again, as I said, these are always approximate buckets and we had some movement within the different cost lines, but being close to where we expect it to be.\nThe other thing you have got to remember, if you look at our strong cash flow that we generated, a lot of that came through inventory reduction and that continued to put pressure on our net cost takeout throughout the fourth quarter and so it was slightly below where we would expect it to be from a conversion perspective, but we had a significant benefit within working capital and inventory that we really felt was appropriate.\nAnd the other thing that you highlighted is that we saw continued trends in inflation outside of raw materials, especially in logistics costs that continue to put pressure on those areas. So those are three of the big items that really caused that to move from where we thought it would be at the end of Q3 to where it was at the end of the year.\nMarc Bitzer\nAnd Sam, the only thing which I want to add is - one is on the tariff, and particularly if you compare the first half with second half, the tariffs largely sit in the second half. So that is - what we saw in Q4 that is pretty much reflective of what we expect to see in Q1. The good news is we delivered North American margins with all the tariffs already being in effect.\nNow the other point and again that is echoing what Jim was saying on the inventory, we drove, year-over-year, a very significant inventory reduction in a pretty much flat demand environment. So, depending on [indiscernible] we have more than $400 million, actually close to $500 million inventory reduction.\nYou also know versus certain fixed cost leverage which is fairly significant, so kind of a negative impact of not having that production volume is fully sitting in these net cost elements. The good news is, we are starting the year with, I would say, very balanced inventory levels and we don't have to reduce that as we go into 2019."]], ["But for 2019 guiding to a 25 basis point headwind, that seems like you are taking your discretionary expenses lower, especially in an area where one could argue it's designed for long-term growth and brand support. ", ["No. And Sam, I would say you kind of hit the nail on the head on part of it there. We are becoming a lot more efficient in what I'll say is our R&D or engineering spending and we have talked about that. Over the last few years the reorganization we have done in that group and how we have aligned to get more projects done with less spending and make ourselves much more efficient in that area.\nWe continue to invest significantly in our products. Additionally, in that space, there are some technology investments that we have had that can ebb and flow throughout periods of time especially with some of the integrations that we have done. And so we are seeing a slight reduction or a reduction in some of those as we wrap up some of the integration within EMEA. So those are the big drivers that we have there. But we do continue to invest in our products, significantly."]], ["Very solid North America margins, could you talk a little bit, Jim, maybe just to start, is there a first quarter or first half weighting ratio that we should be focused on? ", ["Yes. And Ken, we really haven't said anything about weighting. I think you should expect it to be similar to our normal pattern of seasonality within the year and especially as you look at Q1, just I would say it's going to be very similar to prior years.\nThere is no distinct items. Obviously, Marc did mention earlier, the tariffs do weigh a little bit heavier in the first half of the year on us because they accelerated throughout the year. And we do have some additional interest costs within the first quarter due to the term loan we took out in the second quarter of last year, and we will have that until we get the Embraco proceeds in. But outside of that, it's going to be relatively similar from an operational perspective."]], ["You said the 25%, I assume tariff increase, was fully priced in, could you go over that again in terms of - clarify that as well as quantify that in case the 25% does not go through. ", ["Yes. So ken, I mean as you know and given that you cover it quite extensively versus a lot of tariff components, there is the 232, there is 301 which had three different lists. And what we have factored in everything which has been communicated or announced at this point, which means basically everything on the 301, all three lists, including the increase to 25% off of famous List 3 of - part of the 301 section. That is all factored in.\nWe typically don't split kind of different components between List 1, List 2 and List 3. But it's needless to say that if List 3 stays at 10 % yes, that would be positive impact. But in total it's - there is will be a headwinds, but it will be positive impact."]], ["Can you split it up a little more in terms of the suites that you are selling, so steps that little more R&R versus replacement demand and just quantificate on that a little.

Having said that right now, again, we guide North America to a very modest growth of 0% to 1%; and that is against a housing market which is right now steadily moving sideways. However we expect the fundamental demand drivers to be intact and still are reasonably good; actually if we look at the numbers, actually very good consumer confidence.\nWith that in mind, on a - in the traditions between replacements and discretionary, right now we see slightly more than half of our market around replacement and discretionary being less than half as a comparison but discretionary volume is still way below what we saw, for example, in 2005 or 2006 at the peak of appliance demands.\nSo if you want to say so, I mean replacement is a pretty predictable number because that is just typically comes with a - for life of appliances. So the discretionary - yet in the long-term, you could argue still has some upside potential but we did not factor that in, in our 2019 guidance."]], ["Just two quick questions; on North American, the expectations you see for that 0% to 1% growth, if you can maybe just talk to us about your assumptions and what do you think repair and remodel spend growth will be and what your expectations are on new construction?\nAnd then secondly, with regards to the tariffs, particularly the piece that would step up to 25% in March. ", ["I think Alvaro, let me start with your second question. As I just mentioned previously, there is a lot of different moving parts within our cost structure today in terms of raw material increases, tariffs, logistics cost increases. And so the 301 tariffs and that last piece is only a small part of all those increases that you see.\nSo I think there is a lot of other moving pieces and cost pressures that we are seeing right now on top of that. And I think, as Marc mentioned, that - well, it could be a benefit to us, it's not going to be a significant benefit against that total bucket of cost increase that we are seeing right now.\nThe second thing, and then I'll kind of let Marc talk a little bit about the demand. As we have looked over time in terms of how much of the demand is replacement versus discretionary? It typically treads around the 50% range plus or minus 5% from there. And as we look forward to 2019, we don't see a significant deviation in that in terms of what we expect to be just versus the last three or four years what we expect to be discretionary versus replacement.\nMarc Bitzer\nYes. And Alvaro, It's Marc. Let me maybe just add a few additional comments on, particular about housing. And obviously, we all follow the present analyst reports on housing and it almost feels like there was a first a period of overconfidence and now over pessimism, and I think both extremes are wrong I think about fundamental housing, yes we saw some moderation, but fundamentals are solid.\nNow to give a little bit more color, and I think I made some comments on this one on previous earnings call. The U.S. housing market ever since recession has been supply constraints. That supply constraint led to probably an acceleration of home prices ahead of where you would expect in the demand cycle, and kind of that started to stifle down demand a little bit. Come on top of that the mortgage increase which were particular in, I think, August-September of last year. That together led to a small moderation.\nNow, having said that, if you look at the fundamentals of household formation, entry buyers, age of housing stock, rental occupancy, et cetera, et cetera, the fundamentals actually leave a lot of upside opportunity. So, with that in mind, whenever people talk about the housing market, it's not even remotely comparable to what we saw like a decade ago.\nWe are still on the new housing way below 25 year average of new housing and even existing home sales are far away from high numbers. To be more specifically, yes on existing home sales, we would expect the number of clearly north of 5%, probably somewhere around 5.3% to 5.6% in that ballpark.\nAnd of new housing, we would expect the number getting close to $1.3 million, which again is way below kind of what you have seen in previous cycles and way below long-term average. At the same time, we don't expect kind of a double-digit to high single-digit growth of that market. It will be a solid, probably low single-digit growth in the housing market."]], ["So just because Europe was such a big adjustment, I would say, this year, and I think it's important what you're doing in your small business appliance, so you're walking away from $230 million of revenue, which is a $60 million loss.

First of all, beyond exiting certain loss-making business, keep also in mind we announced a fixed cost reduction which structurally lower our infrastructure cost base, so that's a sustained benefit. But you have to do right, I mean we have to stabilize the volume, that's what we always said. And frankly even where we've seen improvement, the improvement has been slow. In the first half, as you saw in the presentation, we lost 18% volume, which obviously given the fixed cost intensity of a business has a massive impact on how you deleverage and the cost you carry.\nIn Q3 we have been able to slightly improve it to minus 12%, I mean from minus 18% to minus 12%, yes, that's an improvement, but it's slow, very simply because it's very difficult midyear to regain floor spots, to re-motivate trade customers given certain annual agreements. Q4 starts better as you saw in the presentation. We expect roughly minus 8%, so it's a further improvement.

", ["So David, it's Marc. Obviously a lot has been written about Sears and Kenmore, and I don't need to add a whole lot to it. First of all, as we already in our announcement last week, the impact on our business is very limited. You saw in our, kind of, announcement, we had \u2013 at the end of the day we had a receivable exposure of roughly around $30 million, which is very low if you could have looked at historical standards. So we managed that down in a very proactive manner. You will also see in our details we accrued for more than half, or about half of it and there is uncertainty around it.\nNow obviously, Sears is in the Chapter 11 process, there's a lot of moving pieces right now. I would expect that Sears will be active in the market with a certain store footprint in Q4, and we're right now \u2013 while we protect our own interest, we're at the same time in a very constructive dialogue with Sears about what it all means for Q4 and going forward. And I would see some Sears activity also happening in Q4 and we will be part of that. But again, there's a lot of moving pieces, but I think we're very well engaged in the process, we have the right support and we will manage it appropriately and accordingly as you would expect it from us.\nParticularly on the questions of the inventory and the inventory liquidation, you should assume that the Sears inventory position was not very high. Sears, first of all, historically always had a very efficient and effective supply chain. So Sears would have historically even been not the big inventory holder, and that inventory came further down over last year. So in any model you have, I would remind, don't overestimate the Sears inventory which is out there because it's very limited."]], ["I mean had a pretty big deficit, I understand that 4Q is a quarter where you generate cash flow, but at least historically it looks like the gap is pretty big. ", ["Yes, Curtis, so the biggest driver of it overall right now year-over-year is working capital. And as I mentioned earlier, our inventory levels are significantly below where they were last year but we reduced those inventory levels in Q3 of this year versus Q4 of last year. And when we reduce them in Q3, you will also see a lower level of accounts payable, which means we have significantly less that we pay out within the fourth quarter this year versus last year. That's the first biggest driver that we see.\nThe next thing that we see on that, while we've said CapEx will be slightly lower this year than we originally expected, most of that is coming the fourth quarter, and that's just due to the timing of some of the investments that we are making as we expect those to flow through. And then the other thing that I mentioned in the prepared remarks earlier was the real estate portfolio optimization opportunities that we have that are partially offsetting the pension contribution. And those are about $125 million, which is coming in Q4 this year, which would be different from Q4 last year."]], ["And so I wanted to understand, kind of, you're pointing out the $800 million of, excluding voluntary items, but it seems like tax rate would've been higher if not for the pension funding. ", ["Yes. So again, you are correct that this has an impact on our overall tax rate of about 3% for the year. So as you look at that go forward, and that's why we've said we are at 10.5% this year, we expect to be below 20% in the future years, but that 3% right now would obviously not repeat itself next year. In terms of impact to cash earnings, it's relatively small this year. If you can just think about the benefit overall on $350 million is around $40-some-million. And so again, not all of that comes as cash within this year also, so that has a very small impact on our free cash flow for this year.\nAlso, looking at the tax rate go forward and the change we made throughout the year, what's happened is the tax regulations have evolved a lot, and it's allowed us to \u2013 at the beginning of the year, most of our tax planning strategies we had in past were no longer available, but it's allowed us to identify new opportunities. And so, we've continued to refine that as we've understood it better."]], ["Maybe just to segue and I guess my next question on EMEA, so just from an EBIT perspective another disappointing quarter, it sounds like a lot of the same issues that dragged earnings in 2Q, we are still there. ", ["So Curtis obviously in Europe and we have said that before, we are disappointed by Q2 what\u2019s not yet any better. First of all putting global context the same inflationary challenges that we have throughout the rest of the world also impacted our European numbers as you have seen in some of the numbers, so that\u2019s an additional burden which we have had in this one. On the volumes side frankly it took us a very long time to resolve some of these trade contracts which are not by and large results, but as you also know in a competitive environment, it\u2019s not that easy to just regain the floor spots which we lost over last 6 months quickly overnight. We are making progress and right now even in a disappointed Q2 we got better month over month over month, but again that\u2019s the number one priority for the second half as we have regained the floor spots, rebalanced without giving up our price increases and in the same time re-focused our strategy particularly on the what is in Europe very profitable in the kitchen business."]], ["Just start off with a question on raw materials I guess the guidance has been 250 to 300, it was supposed to reflect not where raw material inflation was at the time that you posted that guidance, but rather where you thought it might eventually get to. ", ["Yes, David. So this is Jim and I think if we go back to our previous guidance what we have seen since then is we have seen continued pressure on field costs, primarily in the U.S. but also some globally. Resin cost, especially as oil has risen and the last \u2013 in recent times we have seen an increase in oil prices that have pushed that up on a global basis, but some of it concentrated more within the U.S. market right now. Additionally, even as we look across many of the base metals, those have all gone up from our assumptions earlier in the year. So, it\u2019s been rather broad-based with the significant concentration in steel and a disproportionate amount hitting us in the U.S. at this point in time.\nMarc Bitzer\nSo maybe David, I will also add on this one. First of all, you are correct when we give a raw material guidance, it\u2019s a forward-looking assumption and so this is not reflecting spot market of the past, which also tells you our forward-looking assumptions for the year have changed and it\u2019s coming back to what Jim said before, if I basically put it in call it four different buckets, we almost follow the size of our respective raw material purchase. The biggest concern structurally is steel, steel across the world, but particularly in U.S. have increased. Now, we have some protection due to our annual contracts. But as I said before, we are not completely insulated. Two, it\u2019s the resins, which have risen substantially and as you know and we indicated that before we cannot hedge for resins, so we basically are exposed to quarterly inflation and the resins have not come down. And then 3 and 4 almost the same order is kind of the freights, not just impacted by few, but by freight shortage that has risen substantially in kind of a second quarter not technically, but it\u2019s not sitting in our raw materials, but sits in our ongoing cost productivity, but it\u2019s also an element. And lastly \u2013 and again that has only limited impact Q2, but on the forward basis, it has some impact, is we are impacted by the tariffs, either when we are import of records or via our suppliers who have to basically pay the tariffs. So that is an impact going forward, but to a lesser extent in the second quarter."]], ["And then my question, here my real question would be twofold, first off, when do you expect laundry margins, specifically wash machine margins to approach or approximate fleet average for North America? ", ["Sam, these are two questions. So let me first talk about raw material, obviously we are not giving 2019 guidance on raw materials at this point and also to be \u2013 because I think it\u2019s important to be clear in my earlier remarks. On steel, we have annual contracts, they protect us to some extent, but given that there is some element of indexing, they don\u2019t completely insulate us. There is still some steel elements. Second of all, not all parts of what we have annual steel contracts and some of them you buy short. Certainly, there are certain steel parts, not necessarily the cold-rolled steel, but specialty steels like duct stainless steel, where we don\u2019t have annual contracts. So we are impacted by steel prices on our current base. The ever big ticket item are resins, we are not on the annual contract in resins, because you simply can\u2019t get annual resins contract. So, we are fully exposed to the quarterly inflation what we see in this market. And on the all the ever base metals which as Jim mentioned earlier, where we have also inflation, we have hedges in place, but of course at one point you run out of hedges and you are not 100% hedged at any given time. So there are certain exposures and we have got to see also how the future price trends evolve. Having said that, we also convinced that certain spot prices which we see right now in particular on steel we do not believe are sustainable in the external markets, because they are simply disconnected from the input costs and they are also disconnected from rest of the world. Now coming back to the washer margins and again we \u2013 as you know we don\u2019t reveal margins by region or by product platform. Having said that, the washer business as such in Q2 was impacted by very slow market demand in Q2, which you probably can relate back to strong demand in Q1, so probably first half was more balanced, but the Q2 demand in washers were very soft and we have a benefit from a cost-based price increases. So, I would say our EBIT margins on loan we have improved, but they have not yet reached fleet average."]], ["My second question is regarding you are considering the 4% margin in 2020, if we think back to the Indesit acquisition, how much is kind of \u2013 could you isolate some of that shortfall just to the UK in competitive situations there or is there something I heard you say the 8% long-term margin as well, but it seems like it\u2019s getting farther away, so is there something structural that changed within the different countries your \u2013 obviously you lost watch floor space, so your relationships, the retailers was weakened within country which I think is very important, but could you talk about why that seems \u2013 that 8% seems so far away now, so what\u2019s the structural change as it was UK or really IT transition that led to the market share that\u2019s not as quickly recoverable? ", ["And Ken let me try to address it even more obviously [ph] but it\u2019s probably \u2013 at one point analyst conference we got to give you the full story, but the short one is first of all when we talk about the 4% let\u2019s not also not lose sight we have in the business already 4% posted in this acquisition. Actually in \u201814, \u201815 we had 4%, 4.5%, so it\u2019s not kind of \u2013 it\u2019s not a new number, we had it we are also looking at our competitive sets, you would easily come to 6% to 7% margins in this environment are achievable. Now to your question about the sources of the losses, I am not trying to blame at all on UK and Russia, I would say that is approximately half of the losses which we have and that\u2019s just the currency which we don\u2019t think that will recover in the short-term. The other half is also what I would call broader internal execution issues which are related to supply chain and some other elements. So now to your question why does it take us longer to get to 8%, A. Yes, because we don\u2019t expect the UK and Russia to recover in a 1 year or 2 year period. I think ultimately it will come back, but it will take a little bit longer. The other element and this is just a reflection of a long integration with some called internal focus as opposed to external focus. We lost a little bit aside of our profitable kitchen business, that is structurally the most profitable business in Europe, but that takes longer to regain because of typically annual contracts and it\u2019s more than just a floor spot. These are annual contracts which you have to regain and that will take us a little bit longer. But that\u2019s the key element to get this business to 8%."]], ["And just in terms of the leadership changes, could you give us any color there how much is in place, how much will be in place over the next few months?

So we have worked that higher inventory level out and then throughout the back half of the year, we expect to continue to reduce inventories, but it will be on what we expect to be a slightly higher level of demand than we saw in certain markets within the first half of the year. So, we don\u2019t expect significant impacts within the back half of the year due to reducing inventories.\nMarc Bitzer\nSo Mike, the short answer to you, these are changes we announced, but internally last week, we have a change of President in Europe until we name the successor, I will at interim run it. I have run year before, so I know the market very well, but of course that\u2019s not a permanent and long-term solution, but expect us to announce the former successor in the next one or two quarters."]], ["First off, with respect to the guidance and recognizing it\u2019s excluding the accretive effects of the Dutch auction, if I look at your individual line items it would seem as though you should be raising guidance, so it looks like your tax rate incrementally might be a $1 benefit, pricing might be an incremental $0.50 benefit, then this is offset by raw material inflation of $0.50 and offset by global volumes of $0.30, that comes to $0.70 all-in unless I am missing something material. ", ["Sam, let me maybe take that and Jim can add to this one. So, first of all, stepping back also in Q1 we would say our business is on track and we told you in January we talked about the pricing actions, we talked about fixed cost actions. We delivered on both these big parameters and we delivered an all-time record Q1, which \u2013 but gives us the confidence our business is on track. I do agree with you, but if you take the individual components you come to the high-end or even above our margin guidance, at the same time and we alluded to this one in the script, there are still some aggregate risks out there in the form of \u2013 there is still uncertainty about what happens this tariffs so-called Section 301. There is still a little bit uncertainty out there on tax rates. So there are still some aggregate risks and that\u2019s why we kind of at this point we wouldn\u2019t raise the guide, but having said that, we are highly confident in the business, but actions are on track and in a certain way, you also got to look at the tender auction as we feel very confident of our business. That\u2019s why we grow up with a very significant buyback of our shares."]], ["First question just to talk a little bit about margins and margin guidance for the year, I guess another way some people might be looking at the guidance with some of the math in terms of the share repurchase in that let\u2019s say $0.70 movement when you exclude the reduction from lower sales. ", ["Yes, Michael, it\u2019s Marc. First of all, as I have said earlier, I would rob a point to broader global aggregate risk again as the biggest one still buries the uncertainty about raw material even though I mentioned the Section 301 which is more North America topic, but in reality, raw material weighs pretty heavily in all parts of our regional business \u2013 our global businesses. So, I think that\u2019s the prime reason why we still on see certain factors out there, certain risk element. At the same time are also very transparent there is also some upside opportunities, which we want to see how that plays out throughout the year. So, yes \u2013 and again I can only repeat to what I said with them, you take the components of which we are pretty highly confident you probably come to a higher part of the range, but at this point and early in the year, there is uncertainties out there, we don\u2019t want to raise the guidance."]], ["Some people are focusing on the fact that your margins by region are approximately and to the extent that you are truly still looking at the midpoint and working off of that math that the approximately of the different regional margin guidance could now be kind of at the lower end of a range to the extent that when you say roughly 7% or roughly 2% for Europe, that implies somewhat of a little bit of movement or cushion within that number?

", ["Yes. I mean, Michael and obviously we don\u2019t give specific quarterly guidance, but you as I said on the last call is we do believe the first half of the year to be in line with prior years. And even if you look at the last 2 years or you look over a larger window over the last 5 to 6 years, you are in the low to mid 40s range there so in the percentage that you are talking about. And as we said, we expect to be around that percentage in terms of seasonality of earnings for this year very similar to the last 5 years.\nMarc Bitzer\nAnd just to clarify, but it\u2019s not misunderstood and Jim referred to similar to last year, we of course talk about the dispersion of profits we delivered in Q1 $0.30 above last year and you know what our full year guidance is and I would say Q2 is directionally along the same trends."]], ["I just have a question on unit productivity both in North America and in Europe and in \u2013 with North America, the question is what kind of an impact that the washer load-ins from competitors have on Q1 and is it over? ", ["Let me try to address both questions. First of all, on North America, on the washers and first of all, I would say as we indicated several times, there was a lot of odd movement when you look at the AHAM industry statistics, because it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s a sell-in, i.e., included, it\u2019s not necessarily a sell-through. The sell-through over time will follow, but the AHAM is very much a sell-in and it\u2019s as such impacted by shipments of us and certain competitors and certain trade moves in there in terms of how much trade inventory is being carried. With that in mind and we hinted towards this one already in January, but we didn\u2019t yet have the data. The stockpiling by LG and Samsung was massive on unprecedented levels even higher than any prior case and has dramatically dropped off in February. So, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s probably the extreme case of stockpiling which we have seen. So as such confirmed what we had \u2013 what we predicted, but once you see the data, it\u2019s been very significant. And of course, that has certain impact on AHAM market shares kind of December January on how it all shows up. We expect it will, but we don\u2019t know, but it will take some time until that is kind of being fully sold through in the market, but that is to your point, that has an impact on laundry volumes, laundry market share and has a couple of other movements in there. Having said that, our laundry business has still been sold in Q1, we have a set of good innovations in the markets. We implemented a price increase and we feel confident about it.\nNow to your second question about Europe, as Jim alluded to there are certain private label volumes which we knew we didn\u2019t want to continue. So, a certain amount of a drop is expected and was actually productive in a certain way, but having said that, there was also something on top and that is just we lost floor spot over the last 1.5 years and it\u2019s just hard to get that back. In addition, we had following the European calendar of trade negotiations, we had a whole set of trade negotiations in particular in Russia, UK and also in other markets where we had to renegotiate certain trade terms which we were not \u2013 we felt were not favorable and that dragged on pretty much until March, but we have it resolved now."]], ["And I was wondering if you could comment, I guess, on the ability to kind of capture those type of opportunities going forward here and what that could mean for hitting kind of the 4.2 leverage ratio that you guys are targeting there? ", ["Yes. Jeremy, good morning, and thank you for the question. I would just say, first of all, we\u2019re encouraged by the attraction to the kind of assets that we have, which have long histories of cash flow. And so that\u2019s very different than some of the other assets out there that aren\u2019t as well-positioned or more speculative in nature of cash flow.\nSo we think, assets that are stable and have a long history of cash flow are pretty important in this market today. And so we\u2019re very encouraged by that. I would just say, the growth that we have and the continued cash retention that we have in the business, right now, we certainly have our eyes on that 4.2 even without that. But we look at the further transaction as a way to accelerate ourselves towards that, and likely well under that with some \u2013 with any significance to the size of those transactions."]], ["And just want to see, I guess, with regards to producer activity and kind of conversations with producers today versus where they stood at the Analyst Day, just wondering if you could help us think through a little bit more on how that has changed? ", ["Yes. Great question, Jeremy, and thanks for asking that. I know that\u2019s an issue on lot of people\u2019s mind. First of all, I would just say, obviously, we have a very diverse business and some things go South on us and some things go positive. If you think back to last year and you think about the commodity price assumptions that we had versus how the year actually wound up, we outperformed as, again, good evidence of how things can go our way to offset other negatives that occurred during the year.\nSo I would just say, we do have a large portfolio. I also, though, as I mentioned in my comments, and I think this is really important for people to understand. If you look, for instance, a lot of concern around the Northeast volumes and if you look and took the combined \u2013 took the average of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, you would see that if we \u2013 if all we did was repeat that, we would come in above our guidance level for the Northeast for next year, and I know there has been a lot of concern about that.\nIf you took and just took four times the fourth quarter, assuming the fourth quarter held where it was and didn\u2019t see growth \u2013 any growth at all, you\u2019d see a \u2013 we would beat pretty significantly that guidance that we had laid out for the Northeast.\nAnd so that, I would say, combined with a couple of things, one is the fact that our fourth quarter did come in stronger than we were expecting for the Northeast. When we were laying guidance out in \u2013 at Analyst Day, we were working off a forecast that was actually exceeded for the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re starting off better than we start than we expected to.\nSecondly, we\u2019ve seen January and February volumes now. And so we\u2019ve got pretty good confidence about where actual volumes are.\nAnd then finally, I would say, we took the cost that we took out that we\u2019ve worked on and planned around during 2019, most of those costs and the impact of those costs actually started rolling out very late in the fourth quarter of 2019. So we will have the benefit of that working with us going into 2020.\nSo I would just say a lot of positive things that are occurring as well with some deepwater production that\u2019s coming on a little faster than we would have expected as well. And volumes actually, again, exceeding where we thought they would be at this point in time when we laid out at Analyst Day. So those are the things that have given us the confidence on our guidance being maintained as we sit here today."]], ["But I guess, when we think about quantifying a potential impact, is there a way for you to help us quantify how much of your volumes or margin could be considered maybe above market or maybe subject to renegotiation?\nYou\u2019ve been pretty proactive on this front so far. ", ["No, we are not \u2013 I think we have \u2013 we\u2019ve completed all negotiations that anybody has entertained with us on issues right now, particularly with Chesapeake. We settled that in the Eagle Ford, and I think you\u2019ll see this year, I think you\u2019ll see that some of the assumptions that were made by some of the analysts about where that was going are going to be proven very wrong about their assumptions on that for the Eagle Ford.\nAnd I would say this in terms of incenting further drilling, we\u2019ve been working pretty actively. Our commercial teams have been working very actively in places like the Haynesville to incent drilling on acreage that\u2019s dedicated to us, but not otherwise being drilled. And that does require us putting an incentive rate out for new drilling, but it doesn\u2019t affect the rates of the existing business.\nSo it\u2019s just a way to attract new drilling dollars against acreage that Chesapeake, for instance, likely wouldn\u2019t get to, if we weren\u2019t out working transactions to help make that happen."]], ["And then some of the common pushback we received from time to time just around the growth backlog and your ability to spend, I guess, enough to really on those demand pull projects to drive that 5% to 7% growth. ", ["Yes. I think, certainly, we had a great year of growth this last year and on an adjustment for both asset sales and margins, where our growth was a lot better than we would have just built into the plan in terms of volumes and fee-based rates last year, a lot of that came from good cost control and really good execution on our projects, bringing them on a little earlier than expected.\nBut I would say, the things that I think the market tends to miss is the things like the DJ basin growth that continues to come on very nicely for us, the Bluestem project coming on for us, the deepwater, which is really coming back, I think, 95% of the rigs now available \u2013 floating rigs available are in under contract now in the deepwater.\nAnd so we are seeing a lot and expecting a lot coming from that area as well. So, these projects coming on in Transco are pretty powerful, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re totally dependent on for our growth by any stretch of imagination."]], ["Alan, you had mentioned that the volume trends that you are seeing thus far in 2020, can you give us or just frame the activity levels that you\u2019re seeing in some of those primary basins in the West? ", ["Yes. Micheal, do you want to take that?\nMicheal Dunn\nSure. We\u2019re seeing really good results in the Eagle Ford right now coming in, starting the year as well as Haynesville are well ahead of where we thought they would be at this time of year. A little bit challenged in the Wyoming area with the weather. There has been some pretty severe weather in Wyoming this year that\u2019s challenged the Wamsutter area as can typically happen at this time of year. But overall, I think, we\u2019re going to see an increase of what we anticipated so far here in the first quarter from what our forecast should."]], ["And as you look to sort of allocate capital to the highest returning projects, it seems like it\u2019s a \u2013 for this year, it\u2019s a mix of Northeast, regulated transmission, also some deepwater, where you have some operating leverage. ", ["Yes, great question. Well, first of all, I would remind you that our individual project returns are often \u2013 well, in fact, they are well above that number. But that\u2019s working against things like deepwater declines, the declines in basins like the Barnett and certainly deferred revenue step down and things like that.\nSo there is a natural decline in some pieces of the business that those returns have to offset. And \u2013 but I would say that our current returns on projects are as good or better than what we\u2019ve had in our previous mix of projects as we\u2019ve tightened the capital budget. Obviously, as you tighten the capital, you\u2019re allocating stuff out. And so I would expect that number to continue to be as good or better than we\u2019ve had on it on an overall number across the whole portfolio."]], ["And then just on NESE, you mentioned the headlines and certainly I want to put too much emphasis on those but I guess what we're struggling with is, just given what some of the government officials have said, it just seems like some of those statements or maybe hard to walk back to get them to a point where they can improve the pipeline. ", ["I will take that. This is Micheal. We're still confident the NESE is going to have some approvals this fall that allow us to start construction in order for us to meet that winter of 2021 timeframe and why we're confident is because of the significant emissions reduction opportunities that the project allows our customer and the customers of our customer in their service territory in Brooklyn and Long island but also the economic development impact is a very significant if this project does not get built.\nAnd so that's why it gives us a lot of confidence that this will happen and obviously you see the headline and we have been very responsive to the regulators in regard to what their concerns were with our permitting applications that we've remedy those we believe and we do have full expectations that we will have permits in place so that we can start construction this fall.\nAnd our teams do a great job of getting projects done on time and we certainly have developed contingency plans to accelerate construction if we get crunched on our schedule but we certainly believe we can make the December of '20 timeframe so that our customer can meet their peak load requirements that are occurring in the next winter season after this winter.\nOther projects in the queue, I would just tell you we have about $3 billion of capital that we're actively working that's just on the Transco system including NESE and Regional Energy Access and the other projects that we've talked about and certainly will provide a lot more information on this at Analyst Day but we have great confidence in this $3 billion of CapEx, it's about 2.5% Bcf of capacity increase alone on the Transco system.\nAnd these are the ones that we have very high confidence and I can tell you we're working on another couple of billion dollars capital investment just for the Transco system now that certainly out into the future, we're talking maybe a 2020-2024 timeframe as to when those projects will be in service but there is a long runway of projects just on the Transco system that we're actively working now. We have high confidence in it."]], ["Just a question on your thoughts around the mid pipeline sale and that was not certainly at this fall, I believe you guys had a right of first refusal on the transaction. ", ["Yes, I mean part of it certainly was price. If you look at the cash flow relative to the price paid and kind of ignore the structuring around that, it's pretty low return and so that was certainly a piece of it and then there was some consideration that we received in exchange for that and we're not going to discuss the details of that. So we certainly took a look at it but it just didn't make sense really for our given our other investment opportunities that we have. It really just been stack up against our other investment opportunities.\nJohn Chandler\nThis is John Chandler, if you think about that in many ways would be something like debt on our books and we're paying lease payments against that meet interest. We looked at that long and hard to actually buy that interest in what we would have incurred an additional $400 million in debt. Basically, to do that and that's taking our leverage the wrong way. So our leverage focus came into play in that decision as well."]], ["First question just around the financial guidance and being able to reiterate the 5% to 7% long term growth, I think, we were a little surprised there, just given the slight haircut on the Northeast volume outlook. ", ["Yes. Thanks, Spiro. Well, I would just say, obviously when we laid that out, we were that 5% to 7% \u2013 we were counting on a certain level of returns from our projects. And I would just say that some of those things have gone better than that. So in other words, we\u2019ve had quite a bit of improvement if you think about it, since we laid out that 5% to 7%. We\u2019ve had quite a bit of improvements in areas like the Utica within see now and the UEOM transaction. That gives us some synergies and ability to keep our costs even more under control there in the Northeast. So we\u2019ve actually, we said that 5% to 7% some time ago. And just like in any big company like Williams, there\u2019s been some things they go down a little bit, but there\u2019s also things that go up and of course, and we\u2019re continuing to put pressure on our costs as we talked about.\nSo I would say, we are being agile and responsive to those changes. And we\u2019re also picking up advantages like Bluestem, like \u2013 you might\u2019ve noticed our Conway NGL and frac business was up pretty significantly this quarter, which was on the backs of us building up for some of those Bluestem volumes. And so we\u2019re continuing to take advantage where the opportunities exist and those tend to offset things where things change a little bit to the negative, just the benefit of having a big portfolio."]], ["And I think related to that, there was a fairly substantial Marcellus gathering transaction that happened about a month ago and I think Williams had ownership in a couple of those systems. ", ["Yes. No. The answer is \u2013 I\u2019ll just answer the simple part of that first and then I\u2019ll turn it over to our General Counsel to answer the more complex question you started with. On the pinot investment that we have with Rivers \u2013 midstream up there, that is a really small interest and there is not really any opportunity there for us. So there\u2019s really nothing on that front. We do think there\u2019s some good consolidation opportunity up there that we think will like some our way, even with that asset, we think there\u2019s some good opportunity around the liquids that come off of that plant that do come over to UEOM. But again, I\u2019d just say, we were impressed with another high multiple being paid in the space out there. And I think we continue to see that. And so we continue to see our businesses mark well below that, those kind of multiples that are being paid. So we were impressed by it and we are obviously we\u2019re paying close attention to that.\nI\u2019m going to have Lane Wilson, our General Council responds to you on the Blue Racer question.\nLane Wilson\nHey, Gabe, as you\u2019re talking about the news lately regarding the litigation in Delaware. I will think about it. All we want to say there is, that we are cooperating and supportive of the efforts to IPO the Blue Racer business. That said, there are a number of rights around the structure and scope of certain filings that we have related to that IPO efforts. And the litigation is really just effort on our part to protect those rights. Beyond that, I think we just want to wait for the court to rule probably it occurs on time in August."]], ["So I\u2019m just wondering, is that sort of a feeling that you\u2019re going to be at the higher end of the EBITDA range or the lower end of the CapEx range or both? ", ["Well, yes, great question and very fair one. I would just say that on the CapEx side, we\u2019re probably coming in towards the lower end of that range on CapEx guidance. So that\u2019s a piece of it. And as well, I would just say we\u2019ve got more confidence around the way that quarter has gone. And one thing is pretty interesting if you think about it, we always show our CapEx and that\u2019s like gross CapEx number. And so when we \u2013 for instance, the JV we have now with CPP, that\u2019s our gross CapEx that\u2019s embedded there as that is our gross. But our capital burden obviously, is less with CPP picking up some of that capital load from us. And so that actually helps that as well a little bit."]], ["As you had referenced, you renegotiated some agreements in select areas and with select counterparties in the 2015, 2016 timeframe, I think an often instances you received an upfront cash payment and then subsequently lowered the rate as per activity and preserve, I think in total your NPV. ", ["No. Not that I\u2019m aware of, Chris, I\u2019m not \u2013 I don\u2019t see anything out there right now. There\u2019s certainly a lot of desire as we always have. There\u2019s always desires with our producers to further streamline and align our interest out there. And so they\u2019re certainly on that, but I don\u2019t know of anything where there\u2019d be an upfront payment kind of situation out there. And really the only thing, as we had that really was the Barnett that Total now the operator on. And so we\u2019re constantly working with Total and alignment and especially in a low gas price environment. We work closely with them on reducing costs between the two of us out there, very healthy relationship and very positive one with Total there in the Barnett."]], ["Wanted to pick up on the balance sheet situation here, it seems like you guys been quite busy has been noted on the call with asset sales and strategic JVs, really accelerating that deleveraging process here.

I would just say, we\u2019re always looking at that and I would say another driver for that, which is more value than just deleveraging because I think we\u2019re on a very clear path in our mind to get there anyway. And so we feel pretty confident just on the natural path we\u2019re on to getting there. However, given the value spread between what the private space is willing to pay for these cash flows, very certain cash flows versus what the public equity is valuing that. It just continues to provide an opportunity for us to gain value for our shareholders. And so I would say, even if it wasn\u2019t for that for the deleveraging benefit that comes from that, we would be looking at those kinds of opportunities anyway. Just because we don\u2019t feel like our gathering and processing assets are valued appropriately. In fact, I would question where we are today. I would question, if our pipeline assets are being valued appropriately. So we\u2019ll continue to take advantage of that spread.

", ["Yes. I would say, I think we\u2019ve always been on adjusting time mode there in the Northeast for many years now and making sure that we\u2019re staying aligned with the customers and producers up there that are coming to us wanting additional capacity. And we\u2019ll still continue to do that. We\u2019re finishing up some pretty significant projects this year with the TXP-2 installation at Oak Grove that\u2019s now online as well as their checkmark pipeline. Our Monarch pipeline, which is an NGL pipeline that goes to our Harrison fractionation complex.\nSo we\u2019ve got a lot of capital that, we are deploying this year that will be rapidly filling. So I guess in future years, I would say we\u2019re going to be very responsive to the customers there. We are still talking to them about expansions. And so we\u2019re not just in harvest mode, but we are still continuing in each one of those franchises. We talk to the customers about expansions and things they want to do up there, and seeing who has been very active on the cardinal influence systems and evaluating. There are new acres that they bought from Chesapeake and we\u2019re excited to work with them on that as well. So I think we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunities there to continue to look for expansions and it\u2019s certainly going to be depended upon price with many of those producers, they\u2019re very keen on watching the price and what they can achieve there with their net backs."]], ["Maybe some thoughts on the cadence there how you see that kind of progressing over the next several years, based on producer conversations and also kind of CapEx specific to this area? ", ["Yes, in terms of cadence I would just say right now we've got a lot of activity, a lot of wells being and pad being turned in the line right now as we speak actually here in the last month. So a lot happening out there right now, it's all over the place both in the Northeast and the Southwest. And so what's going on that, I would say in the Utica area the Encino team there has just now taking over operations of that area, and transition from Chesapeake and that we are really working closely with them to have kind of the same kind of integrated approach to development and growth development that we have with both Cabot and Southwestern, so really excited about the team they've pulled together there at Encino and our ability to work with them.\nIn terms of kind of the cadence there, I would just say certainly, Cabot intending to lead the way with development with 20% kind of growth. And so I would the Northeast PA continues, they have continued to invest with or support our expansions of further expansion on our gathering systems out there. And of course we're very interested in additional takeaway capacity out of the area, given the big reserves and the low cost reserves they have in the area. But I would say in the Northeast there really hasn't been anything other than just continued steady performance by Cabot, and we're starting to see that kind of spread in to some of the other areas as well like in the Bradford area. So Northeast, so I think is very predictable and steady. The areas that have more I would say volatility in terms of ups and downs and perhaps things are little more reactive -- the prices is in the west gas areas like I mentioned earlier, both the Marcellus wet and the Utica wet. And a lot of that, I would tell you is driven by pretty sharp price -- realized price decline on NGLs that were associated with the Mariner East up and down, in the course of now hoping for expanded capacity out of their own Mariner East 2.\nSo I would say that the pricing forecast on NGL has been difficult to predict. And of course the gas takeaway situation particularly with the MVP has been pushed back a little bit as well. So I think those things will resolve themselves as we get in. Obviously as we get into 2020, I think those things will resolve themselves. But we are seeing those producers be very responsive and I would say very strict about living within their cash flows and their forecasted cash flows. Of course that requires them to forecast prices. But I think that's what we can look to in terms of signals there. Our drilled outflow continues to be pretty robust for both the Southwest PA and the Utica area, a lot of new capital. But we're finding ways to really trim that back, and have a capital come on just in time, as the production comes on and so that's what you see we requested in some of our capital pullback and redemption in capital, that you see here in our guidance."]], ["Can you just talk a little the decisions to kind of keep going with some discussions and having extended timeline here fairly considerably, I assume you're pretty confident in terms of your position there, so why not a move -- to maybe litigate a little bit earlier than end of 2020? ", ["I wouldn't say it's necessarily extended out per se, it's just a process we have to go through in front of a administrative law judge there and regards to trying to reach resettlement. So we think it's prudent to continue that process, until we reach impasse with our customers, but we certainly not there yet. So we're rapidly working with them to try to come to a settlement that both sides appreciate and like. But it certainly doesn't mean we won't be willing to litigate that, we would impasse and certainly the administrative law judge will assist us in getting there. Hopefully, quickly, so that we can don't move on to litigation path, that settlement is not, where we ultimately end up, but we would love to have a settlement with our customers there, we think it's a proper way to -- hopefully to achieve a good outcome for both sides. But, we're not afraid of litigation path as well.\nSpecifically on the emissions reduction, so the way we've contemplated that it would be a separate tracker as we spend the capital, we would basically change the rate upwards to accommodate the compression that's been replaced there. And it's really just allows us to do that, as if we were going through a rate case, so to speak. Without having to go for a rate case we'd be able to increase those rate, as we deploy that capital to reduce those emissions along the Transco pipeline system. And so it's ultimately we don't get the emissions tracker, that would make it more likely that we would have more rate cases coming, to be able to accommodate those emissions reductions projects within our rates."]], ["Hypothetically is ACP and let's say even if MVP didn't go through, meaning got stuck in the court system, bogged down for a lot longer or cost creep inflated to a point making it untenable. ", ["Yes, Michael, obviously it's topic that's been getting a lot of discussion. We have a lot to offer, in terms of distributing the product with gas to market whether it's healthy, what would be the ACP, Eastern system or moving supplies to them. We have -- we do have a tremendous amount to offer with our existing lighter weight. MDP is more just kind of a downstream issue so to speak, because obviously they're getting across the trial with those supplies.\nAnd so that's really struggled there. But, I would say, we have a lot more to offer ACP in terms of meeting their market distribution goals. And as the MDP, they need, they're going to need some market distribution as they do get across the trial and we're well-positioned to help them out with that. So that's how I describe that. Obviously in this environment I think it's important for all of the industry participant to try to utilize as much as existing facilities as possible, keep the cost down and that's what we're very focused on in both those cases."]], ["But if ACP for some reason or another didn't get completed, how much new infrastructure, or new steel in the ground, how much significant new pipe would you have to build especially to get it? ", ["I would say we have a lot of -- lots of [indiscernible] already into some of those markets, but it is significant in terms of the investment, it's not, it's obviously quite a bit lower cost by using the existing facilities. But it would be pretty significant investment required and it's very dependent on where the supply comes from. So a lot of variables here depending on where the supply comes from. But if you just showed up with the supplies along that 155 to 194 corridor, we have a lot of ability to help distribute that gas into the market."]], ["And my second question very much appreciate the reading or the presentation materials and something that we always acknowledged but illustrates clearly, I think it's Slide 13 it's just the significant non-cash items that 2% of drag to EPS. ", ["That's a weird commentary for a CFO to look for impairments, but it is something obviously that to the extent we could have that, it would benefit our depreciation -- by lowering our depreciation which is way out of line with our maintenance capital. There is really not a lot we can do on that front, absent to the extent we partner on assets that we consolidate today. That and to the extent we move the assets from a consolidation to a non-consolidation type approach to maybe partnering through JVs. That potentially could allow us to revalue assets and impair, and bring that depreciation level down. Anything short of that though, any of the test or impairment is based on gross cash flows, and well a lot of these assets got marked up to really high-value, back in the Access, Midstream merger, which was not a cash deal which is stock-for-stock trade but it forced us to revalue a lot of the Access assets at a very high valuation level.\nWhile those are at a high level, the gross cash flow still exceeds those book value. So anything short of actually some system kind of partnership for JV that would force some level of deconsolidation, that's the only thing that allows really to help bring that depreciation down."]], ["So I'm just kind of wondering how you guys look at the strategically, when you get together kind of bouncing growth, delevering and returning cash to shareholders over the longer-term and I think you said kind of the -- to leverage target, but what you think the right leverage is for a company with the asset mix of Williams? ", ["Yes. I would just say our asset mix, just we don't have a lot of -- very little business that's marketing based, is not basis differential based, it's not the term optimization that gets you to often around the assets, which is trading around the assets. We don't have that kind of variability per cash flow. And I bet you can see that with the remarkable predictability to our cash flow streams, that continues to flow. So no, I don't think they ought to get -- mark all the same, but I would say that the rating agencies have told us that, on their basis, it's a 4.5x kind of number to be BBB flat, and we want to be there be confidently there, at BBB flat level. And so that for 4.2x mark on kind of a steady run-rate basis is what we are seeking that because that happens to be coincidental with that BBB flat side from the rating agencies."]], ["I mean, I guess if you guys are getting feedback from the investment community, do you really want to see something more of 4x, is that something that you would aim for in that case? ", ["I would just say from my own personal perspective on that. I think they're tend to be fads that move through the investment community. And I think from our vantage point keeping our debt costs down and capacity to flex when we need to, is what we're targeting from the business trajectory. And I think we think that's really the smart place for us. And I think the market has to figure out, and it should figure out, who has volatility in their cash flows and who doesn't, and that ought to be driving the number, that each company should aspire to not just because somebody magically came up with a 4x number."]], ["Listen I realize you're not going to make some announcement regarding management on this conference call, but it feels like when we get to the end of this year, there's going to be some retirements.

The Willis Towers Watson Board of Directors, of course, they're the ones who lead the succession process for the role of CEO. And the Board acting through the governance committee is actively engaged in the whole succession planning process. And this isn't something that has happened this year or last year or even just the year before. This has been a multi-year thinking about what our talent is and how we bring them along and how we develop them.\nAnd so the Board and the governance committee have been regularly involved in that. They meet with me and our Head of Human Resources on a regular basis. We've engaged a third-party to make sure we have an outside look at the experience and attributes of our candidates.\nOur expectation is that we will name a new CEO in the second half of this year. So, we're going to make sure we have enough time to allow an orderly transition. But other than that, that's pretty much all I can say at the moment."]], ["And then when we take a look at the overall guidance for 2020 in terms of the 4% to 5% organic growth, you mentioned TRANZACT should continue to grow at least 20% plus year-over-year.

But Mark, when we build our overall growth for the company we do it segment by segment almost line of business by line of business. So we go through and we do think for example, I mean and just as one clear thing, CRB is going to grow faster than Retirement. We just pretty much know that. So we build the models that way but \u2013 and then we just give a revenue growth for the company."]], ["My first question going back to the margin discussion, I understand from one of the earlier questions you pointed to kind of neutralizing for TRANZACT right and then still being within that 50% to 70% target.

We project our margin line of business by line of business. And certainly we see more opportunities for margin improvement in CRB where we're trailing some of our peers in terms of what we have been saying, retirement where we're ahead of our peers. So those are reflected in our projections, yes."]], ["And then, on the DSO side and maybe coming back to the seasonality question earlier, I would think that a lot of the contracts got renewed at the very end of the year or the very beginning of the year. ", ["Yeah. I mean we've got a lot of factors in that first quarter. As you rightly said, I mean we were tacking all the contractual terms that we have to be in place. We're aligning it from a variable compensation standpoint. But we also have the bonus payments. We have tax payments and those amounts that come in there. And candidly, we're looking to make sure we meet what we're saying we've put out there in terms of expectations around.\nSo, that's the game plan. I understand what the logic where you're going, but we see the first half of the year being more of a use of cash and really see it, and if you look back historically in the company you really see it build over the second half of the year with the fourth quarter being outsized in terms of cash coming in.\nJohn Haley\nAnd I would just point out that the changes to the variable compensation plan, which are -- I mean we've discussed with the Board and the comp committee, they won't be formally put in place until the end of this month at our Board meeting, but we've discussed making these changes with them. So, we'll have those in there, but they weren't in last year. And so, we'll see the impact from them in this year. But I would hesitate to ascribe any effect to them from last year."]], ["And if I just think about the organic growth outlook would you kind of categorize organic growth is kind of being more of a tailwind in recent quarters and kind of going into 2020? ", ["Yes. So starting with your last question first. Yes, TRANZACT, I mean as soon as we get to same-store sales then we will include it in there from an organic growth standpoint. In terms of your question about tailwinds on organic growth, yes in certain of our business if you look at -- we've seen some pricing. So if you look back to our marketplace realities report that we put out most recent one in November 2019 you definitely continue to see price in the marketplace continues to be a tailwind, but equally obviously we got to do the right thing for our customers and clients and thinking through that. But we have seen some pricing tailwind come through that.\nAnd if you look at our organic growth rates we've been right at the market and we look at our peers in terms of what we've been growing at. So when we put out there for organic growth rate for the current year we had 4% to 5% and we build our budgets and we've been pretty consistent around it looking at 4% in terms of how we're more skewed that way in terms of how we think about it. But we're being realistic in recognizing the tailwinds that we see out there. So that's why we went with 4% and 5%.\nJohn Haley\nYes. And the only other thing I'd add to that is that pricing is only one part of the equation for us in the revenue because as prices go up people buy less of it. And so it's the net that is what we're trying to solve for."]], ["One just curious, if I look at the TRANZACT margins and just the impact on margins overall, if I kind of look at on a pro forma basis, is TRANZACT assuming you have a full year 2020 and it was full year 2019, is it accretive to the BDA margins and overall company margins, or is it kind of dilutive or in line? ", ["Yeah. So when we look at the full-year, it will be accretive overall. Again, just going back, when you look at and we talked about this in terms of where the margins ended up in the fourth quarter, we're actually down for BDA overall. And that being down was although TRANZACT has very good margins and we're very pleased with their margins, but you only had five months of expenses and five months of revenue that was included in there. And so the margin was a bit higher and we've normalized that as we think about fiscal year 2020. But to your first question, it is absolutely accretive and we're very excited about -- with that growth and what we're going to see.\nJohn Haley\nBut accretive but lower percentage margins.\nMike Burwell\nMargins.\nJohn Haley\nSo the TRANZACT margins, when we bring TRANZACT in, it adds to the dollars of earnings we have, but it's a lower percentage."]], ["Is there any way -- I know, it's only numbers for two months, but could you give us a sense of both, A, what the revenue growth was for those two months?\nAnd then, also, I know, TRANZACT did, as you would expect it to follow the same seasonality as BDA in terms of losing money in every quarter, but the fourth quarter. ", ["Yes, Elyse. So just going back, I mean, what we said, if you go back, originally on TRANZACT was that we would have 25% to 30% CAGR growth rates for TRANZACT and that's what we had anticipated happening. And frankly, that's what we're seeing. Really running at those rates so far and that's not changing in terms of what we had said and that was reflected in our revised guidance that we did at the end of the second quarter.\nJohn Haley\nBut the fourth quarter is really the big quarter.\nMike Burwell\nThe fourth quarter is a big quarter. But we anticipated moving in that direction. On TRANZACT impact in the third quarter was a $0.04 dilution. And, I guess, it was highlighted in my comments. So that's how we saw for the third quarter."]], ["In your slide deck presentation, I think you mentioned John on the call you said that -- well you pointed out to a higher debt at the end of the third quarter.

As you can see in our cash flow statement we paid $1 billion -- roughly $1.3 billion round numbers for TRANZACT. We had taken a term loan for $1.1 billion. We had taken out financing -- or we had gone to the market and done financing, of which we termed out a portion of that $1.1 billion and we paid off any outstanding amounts we had on our credit line.\nSo that's why -- that then -- if you looked at it on a pure debt-to-EBITDA ratio Greg, it went from two point -- up to 2.7. We historically have been in the 2.1% to 2.3% range, which I would say historically, which is where we'd like to get back to.\nWe said on purchase of shares, share repurchases that we would buy shares in the marketplace to make sure that we weren't anti-dilutive given our employee benefit plans that we have to be in place.

Right now, we're saying three years is long -- in our mind a bit longer term. If you want to go beyond that I guess right now, we're saying three years.

So when -- we'll, obviously, update as we -- as you rightly pointed out, we're up 150 basis points through the nine months and 120 basis points in the third quarter as it relates to margin. It starts, obviously, Greg with the revenue growth. And I think as John commented on in terms of what we're seeing in terms of revenue growth and then driving that operating leverage is managing our cost base.\nAnd so our leadership team and operating committee very focused as well as all our colleagues are very sensitive to managing our cost base and driving our revenue growth. So we'll update guidance at Q4 in terms of what we see going forward, but our track record has been to continue to deliver that revenue growth and that operating margin. And so we're very focused on managing that differential.\nJohn Haley\nAnd by the way Greg just one thing -- to be clear, as we think about this going forward, we may very well have some restructuring programs that we'll put in place. But what we think we're not going to do is, we're not going to be trying to exclude them from income and try to play games like that. If we have restructuring programs, we'll just tell you about them and tell you what they cost."]], ["With respect to the TRANZACT business, I was wondering if you could share with us your thoughts of what the different versions of Medicare for all could mean for that business?

The proposals vary tremendously in scope and there's a lot of unknowns. So for us to speculate on exactly what the outcome would be, it's pretty hard at this moment.\nI guess, I would say though we've actually thought about a lot of some of these different scenarios as to what they could mean. We think the most reasonable thing is that changes in the country's health care model would create some new client needs.\nAnd given our positioning and especially, our positioning post the TRANZACT acquisition we feel pretty good about our prospects. Now some of the really extreme versions of this are ones that frankly, which would be bad I think for everybody and for the country. I just don't think there's much chance of those coming into force, but you know, who knows."]], ["I thought we were done with ASC 606, but it popped up in Mike's comments and if I'm not mistaken, the benefit to 2019 was going to be in total around $40 million and you've only booked $11 million of that.

I thought we were done with it too and I was telling folks that have reminded me from the scene in Carrie where the hand comes up out of the grave to strangle you. We just can't seem to get rid of this the effects of the standard so up. Mike?\nMike Burwell\nYes. So, Greg, the number actually is $59 million in total and the remainder above the $11 million that I commented on in my prepared remarks will happen by the end of the third quarter."]], ["And then thinking forward as you look at other potential deals over the longer term, is it -- are you thinking about more like TRANZACT that have that digital online exposure. ", ["So I think something that has that kind of digital capability and that kind of exposure that's a feature that makes a deal more attractive. It doesn't mean that every deal has to have that there. So we'll be looking into that. But in general, what I laid out was where -- we're looking for businesses that are going to be high margin businesses either are already there, or have the capability to get there relatively quickly. We're looking for businesses that fit in and that are relatively near adjacencies to our existing business and we're looking for that simply put because we want to understand the businesses ourselves. We don't want to be acquiring things that we don't understand inside and out. So that's why we're looking for things that are relatively near adjacencies.\nBut within that, if the deals accretive it's more attractive, then if it's dilutive, if it has more digital capabilities, it's more attractive than if it doesn't. So we'd be looking about that. Having said that, we're really focused on organic growth."]], ["I was hoping maybe you could spend a minute and sort of give us some of the components that you would expect near term and longer term to drive free cash flow growth because it's clearly growing at a faster cliff than your earnings per share guidance by suggest. ", ["Well, yes. I think so. First of all, profit is something that we expect to be growing significantly over the years. And one of the things to notice is that, Mike referenced some of the headwind we have from lower pension income though what that means is, we actually are getting more free cash flow as a larger percentage of our profit that we're getting there. So, that's going to be helping us. We have no integration cost going forward. We're going to be focusing on our working capital. And we are -- we successfully lowered our DSOs this year, and we're going to continue to press on that in coming years, Greg."]], ["I just want a couple of things, I just wanted to jump into, and Mike maybe you can just, give us just a little bit more detail on the pension stuff. ", ["Well, some of -- no if you look at -- we have obviously -- we have an extra actuary. And in actuarial services that we provide to many times, we obviously provide that to ourselves in terms of going through that determination is no secret in terms of some of the assets performance that happened last year in 2018. And that had a direct impact in terms of what the returns would be for us going forward and in calculating that actual evaluation. So really that's the direct piece of it.\nJohn Haley\nMaybe I just make it, maybe just make a couple comments quickly on that, Shlomo. So first of all, markets tanked in December, so we just have a lot less pension assets at the end of December when we do the measurement. Interestingly enough during the same time, you might have thought that the interest rates would be going up, but in fact, they went the longer term rates just a little bit. So, our liabilities increased at the same time that our assets were going down. We are a mark-to-market company. So we don't smooth the assets. So if you look at companies that smooth the asset performance over the years, they can hit a little bit by some of the drop that we experienced in the fourth quarter, but they're offsetting that by maybe some increases from prior year. So, it's not as big a difference, the companies that mark-to-market see bigger differences year-to-year.\nMike Burwell\nAnd the cash implications, this is nominal, it's very small."]], ["Just can you give a little bit more specific in terms of the DSOs and what the goal is there and how we should think about the EBITDA, the free cash flow conversion? ", ["Okay. Thanks Mark. So, let me start off and say, from the segments I think the earnings growth rate is actually reasonably consistent across -- all of the segments, I think BDA is a segment that we talked about -- we're having the great growth in the new enrollments. But, of course that's also a segment with when you're selling to retirees there there's a mortality element that you have to take into account too, so you lose some of your customers every year. And some of the premiums that we got when we first enrolled people only last for a certain number of years, so they fade off too.\nSo, my point is I think BDA has been by far the fastest growing of our segments over the last couple of years; we'll see that more in the same pack I think with the rest of them. And at a broad brush, 30,000 foot level, they all look more like -- all look about the same as the Company overall. I think IRRs is the one that probably has the most volatility, within segments, we'll see things like health and benefits, which I think will be very fast growing, but then that could be offset by other parts. So, the 4% is probably not a bad thing to think about for all the segments. In terms of what did we -- excuse me?"]], ["The first question on the organic growth, you have nice rebound from the second quarter, if you look at your results towards the segments, it's roughly in line with your global peers. ", ["Yes. So let me say I think when we had the second quarter call I think we advised people that it was probably better look at the first half as a comparison as to how we were doing against our peers versus the second quarter. Only if you look at the first half, we were at or above our peers generally. And one of the things I think we're delighted with the revenue growth we have here. And we're especially delighted because if you look at it in the third quarter of last year, our revenue growth was generally higher than our peers in the third quarter of last year. So we had tougher comparables, so having tougher comparables and getting the growth we had here we couldn't be happier with the result. And we think that reflects our competitive positioning if we look at the third quarter, the whole three quarters of this year. We think that's a fair look at our competitive positioning."]], ["But can you help us understand realizing, you don't want to get into specific EPS guidance for next year, what's some of the key headwinds and tailwind would be to that. ", ["Yes. I mean, I when we look at -we feel good about our businesses in terms of their growth prospects going forward. And as I referenced in terms of what we thought we would be in terms of the rates of overall revenue growth and those low to mid single digits for all business except BDA. And really kind of being in that double-digit area, but we feel good about those prospects and obviously as we've continued to perform whether it gives more difficult comps for us no different than we had in this quarter.\nBut we feel that's the kind of right growth and as John said we will update that here in the fourth quarter. As it relates to tax, I would just say and we're continuing to work the real-time numbers here, but as I mentioned in my prepared comments as well that we had discrete items that drove our tax rate down here in the third quarter. We believe that those discrete items will -- some of those will reverse in the fourth quarter. And again doing nothing more than the math and when you look at it at 20% to 21% effective rate, it gets you about a 23% to 27% rate in the fourth quarter in terms of looking at it.\nAs you look at and think about that rate going forward we have no reason to believe it will be different. Frankly, at this time but we'll continue to evaluate all treasury guidance as it's issued and its applicability to us. We do believe we will see some additional rules come in the fourth quarter. We will evaluate those and honestly, we'll update on year end call in terms of what that looks like for us going forward, but at this stage we don't know anything further and that's kind of our best guess and best view, and not guess but our best perspective of it going forward.\nJohn Haley\nYes and let me just make sure we're clear about this. I think to answer Elyse's questions the discrete item we had in this quarter was about $12 million or something like that. That's going to reverse in the fourth quarter. So when we're giving you the projection of 20% to 21% for the year, that's something that's not affected by this discrete item because we've already assumed that's going to reverse in the fourth quarter. And I guess that's really what probably I think Elyse was asking for is. What's a --how can I get to a more normal tax rate and I think what we're telling is 20% to 21% is what we see as the normal tax rate."]], ["And then on the flip side it seems like again kind of going back to Elyse's question at least the taxes reverting back to perhaps a more normalized level for next year would be a headwind. ", ["Yes. I mean, I when we look at -we feel good about our businesses in terms of their growth prospects going forward. And as I referenced in terms of what we thought we would be in terms of the rates of overall revenue growth and those low to mid single digits for all business except BDA. And really kind of being in that double-digit area, but we feel good about those prospects and obviously as we've continued to perform whether it gives more difficult comps for us no different than we had in this quarter.\nBut we feel that's the kind of right growth and as John said we will update that here in the fourth quarter. As it relates to tax, I would just say and we're continuing to work the real-time numbers here, but as I mentioned in my prepared comments as well that we had discrete items that drove our tax rate down here in the third quarter. We believe that those discrete items will -- some of those will reverse in the fourth quarter. And again doing nothing more than the math and when you look at it at 20% to 21% effective rate, it gets you about a 23% to 27% rate in the fourth quarter in terms of looking at it.\nAs you look at and think about that rate going forward we have no reason to believe it will be different. Frankly, at this time but we'll continue to evaluate all treasury guidance as it's issued and its applicability to us. We do believe we will see some additional rules come in the fourth quarter. We will evaluate those and honestly, we'll update on year end call in terms of what that looks like for us going forward, but at this stage we don't know anything further and that's kind of our best guess and best view, and not guess but our best perspective of it going forward.\nJohn Haley\nYes and let me just make sure we're clear about this.

", ["Yes. So I think, look, the --what we've always said is if we can find acquisitions that make sense and in organic growth, we --that's actually what we would prefer to do. We prefer to find things that can grow the organization and grow it profitably. When we're comparing that to a stock that we think is somewhat undervalued at the moment, it's hard to find some acquisitions that actually pass those threshold particularly acquisitions of any size. And so we're going to continue though with that overall priority. Acquisitions that make sense would be number one, and if we can't do that we're going to return our cash to shareholders.\nAs I mentioned in responds to a previous question if you look at the last quarter, we returned over 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders. I think that's something that we would be looking to do in the future."]], ["I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what might be or could be possible levers for margin improvements really beyond 2019 and beyond as well and excluding sort of the obvious of just trying to get revenue faster than expenses. ", ["Well, I mean the obviously answer I think is that technology is making us more efficient, making all employees more efficient in all businesses. And I think that's especially true in a professional service firm like ours. And so we continue to look at the possibilities of using technology in all of our consulting businesses, as well as in our brokerage businesses. I mean I joined the company over four years ago as an actuary and I look at the kind of projections it used to take me a month to do on these enormous spreadsheets, actual physical paper spreadsheets that I had.\nAnd today's actuaries press a button and get 10,000 of them in three seconds. So we've seen technology influence everything we do. And I think sometimes we don't recognize some of the incremental things that occur year-to-year, but that would be the biggest part."]], ["And if you look at your result in the second quarter and compare it with some of your other publicly traded peers, it looks to be at the lower end of the range. ", ["Yes. Thanks, Greg. And I think you're absolutely right the way you've characterized the quarters over time. And one of the reasons that we spent some time talking about the first half today is we don't think the momentum is slowing in the second quarter, but we do think we have to look at the whole first half together. I think, last year, we, I think, did a good job of alerting analysts generally to the fact that we saw the first half as being -- the first quarter as being stronger than the second quarter and maybe absorbing some of the revenue. We didn't necessarily see that this year, but we think that that's certainly what happened. There was a -- there's a component to that. But when we look at it, we think that the first -- the revenue growth for the first half is a better indicator of what the second half will look like rather than the revenue growth for the second quarter."]], ["But for the second quarter, I have to say that the risk -- the results in Corporate Risk & Broking, Investment, Risk & Reinsurance were down year-over-year, excluding the revenue standard. ", ["Sure. I know Mike will want to weigh in with some color commentary on this. But let me just say that I think that those 2 segments are actually different, in our minds. IRR, even though the results may look like they're not as robust as we might like, they're actually right on target for what we had projected. And so we have had -- we disposed of some businesses there. We have bumped up -- our biggest investments that we're making in our business are really 2. One is in the Innovisk and the other is in AMX. And both of those are in IRR. So the margins that we have there are exactly on our forecast that we had here internally. But the CRB is different. That was -- that is truly where we had expected to be. And I think it's largely a revenue thing in the second quarter, but it's partly expenses being a little bit higher. Mike, do you want to give a little more color on that?\nMichael Burwell\nYes, John. I mean, when we look and think about the CRB point drive that you raised, we look at it and say, we have been making some further investments in resources around cyber, M&A resources that we have deployed into the CRB segment. FX impacted by 70 basis points just in terms of margin for the quarter. And we also -- as we mentioned in the press release, contingent revenue was down a bit for us, specifically in the U.K. that we had seen. So again, we focus on the annual margins overall. As you say, 1 quarter doesn't make a year either one way or another, and so we are focused in terms of where they are. But as John said, it's a little bit below where we'd like it to be, but we're optimistic about what the recovery will be over the second half of the year."]], ["I get that, but just -- I guess, John, are you more of the view coming out of this integration, does earnings growth come more, you think, as a function of organic revenue on the top line side? ", ["Yes. I actually think it's a combination, Ryan. I think -- we expect, as I said earlier, to be growing as fast as the market or faster. That's our expectation of what we'll do. And although we didn't do that in the second quarter, we did it for the whole first half of the year. And so when I look to 2019 and beyond, we still expect to be doing that. And so we expect to be seeing that hope on margins. But at the same time, we think that -- we think that there's a lot of things we can do to improve the overall efficiency. And so we expect to see some margin improvement from that, too."]], ["And then, can you also remind us, sticking to Las Vegas, your expectations for room pricing this year, with convention center and some of the other amenity buildouts in Last Vegas.

", ["Sure. So I\u2019ll kick it off. And then Ian, you can chime in. But as I said before, we thought Macau was really set up for a great 2020. We\u2019re very optimistic about the new Chief Executive and the direction that he is taking Macau. We feel good about all the infrastructure that\u2019s coming in place. Clearly, the visit in December by President Xi was wildly lauded around really all throughout China as Macau has done a great job with the 1 country and 2 systems. So we feel really good about Macau\u2019s position going forward. Ian, do you have any thoughts on that.\nIan Coughlan\nWe \u2013 2 years ago, when the Greater Bay Area was being discussed at the governmental level, Macau was described as having a seat in one of the VIP carriages as the Greater Bay Area move forward after President Xi\u2019s visit. It\u2019s now positioned Macau in a leading role, which is wonderful for everybody in Macau business and community. And secondly, on the new Chief Executive, he barely sat in his seat and he has this huge virus maelstrom. He\u2019s being quite amazing in his clear concise pragmatic communication with the community, and also with business. We\u2019ve been in daily dialog with government and it\u2019s been quite remarkable, and the decision making that he has done in his first few weeks."]], ["Are you encouraging vacation or any of those sorts of things that may mitigate some cost impact?\nAnd then secondly, I wanted to change the subject and talk a bit about Encore Boston, and just sort of get your updated view about what a ramp to a payback period might be over time and how you\u2019re envisioning that. ", ["Sure. So this is Matt. For \u2013 on the cost containment side in the normal operating environment, I think, in all of our properties, we\u2019ve been doing a very good job focusing on costs and being smart and efficient. Right now in Macau, the roughly $1.8 million to $1.9 million a day of payroll, we are not looking at cutting that at all. Now is the time when you invest in your people, you don\u2019t do something short-term that will hurt the culture or cause any distraction. So we\u2019re investing in the community right now because we know this will be temporary, and we think that it\u2019s the right long-term investment.\nFor Encore Boston Harbor, when we laid out the program, when we opened to Analyst Day, we talked about a 2-year ramp period. Admittedly, it has launched softer than we thought, and particularly on the slot side. And so we\u2019re doing a lot of work. What we realized was, we didn\u2019t have quite the right food and beverage program in particular around quick serve for the daytime slot customer. It\u2019s actually the same thing that we went through at Wynn Palace. And when we opened, we realized we needed more quick-serve restaurants in Wynn Palace, we immediately closed a third of the casino. We built Red 8, we built 5 new restaurants in the meantime. And so we\u2019re going through that process in a very fast way at Encore Boston Harbor, because when we see a problem, we fix it. So I think we\u2019re still in that 2-year ramp up mode."]], ["And then maybe just bigger picture in terms of what you're seeing in Macau on the VIP side, obviously, we were still facing some comparisons that were a little bit challenging in terms of role in the market, et cetera.

I think that a lot of people are very optimistic that that we're at a stabilization point and that 2020 could be a period where we're starting to see some growth. Carlo, in the past, we've spoken about, just to go back to your question, direct versus junket and it's ranged from 80:20 down to 90:10 between junket and direct.

So we feel really great about that. 2020, of course, February is the launch of the convention center. And we will see a good growth in the convention center, but during the Investor Day, you'll recall that we talked about the room remodel.

And so, we have a real opportunity to continue to capture market share at the higher end of the business. So we will be completely reprogramming the lake of dreams with new shows. We're remodeling all of our rooms at Wynn Las Vegas. We have a new convention center. We have new restaurants. We're spending the money to create an entirely new fun experience here while a lot of our competitors are not doing that. And so, we see real opportunity in Las Vegas to capture share.

But in order to really understand what would work, we believe that first we need to see how Resorts World opens, which is coming in the next 18 months, I believe. Get a feel for the market; watch the Raiders stadium come in. Right now, it's expensive to build in Las Vegas. The trades have more jobs than they have manpower.

But I think it's been hard for us to actually quantify that impact. Ian, do you have any thoughts on that?\nIan Coughlan\nThere's been some residual impact more about people that would travel through Hong Kong and then come onto Macau, but I don't think it's been market significantly impactful. With all the other headwinds that are there, it's hard to break out. As long as the airport stays in operation, that's a very good feeder for us as you referenced in the premium mass sector."]], ["Also, through the -- since your Investor Day, one of the -- a lot of the questions that we've gotten on the Crystal Pavilion project was how you were thinking about the targeted return of 15% to 20%. ", ["Sure. So I'll start with that. Again, clearly, Wynn Palace needs more than 1,700 hotel rooms. I think you can see from some of our competitors that have just ramped up their new quite nice hotel product, what that has done to their bottom line. Our hotel is full. And on the weekends, we're turning away customers that we do not want to be turning away, and we know that they will spend more time and more money with us if they're staying with us. That coupled with the multigenerational travel that exists in Asia much different than really anywhere else in the world, the Crystal Pavilion is going to attract lots of customers, but also as we see at Cotai, families travel with customers.\nSo we think that the Crystal Pavilion Entertainment -- the Crystal Pavilion project will be attractive to a much broader audience and we've estimated that we expect over 10 million visits to that on an annual basis. So the premium mass will be in the hotel and we think that we'll get significant incremental visitation from the core mass with the project."]], ["Is there anything you can do that's outside of obviously a meaningful room expansion to remix the property, or sort of optimize palace to take advantage of the market conditions as they are today. ", ["Well, Shaun, we have been doing that. So for our core mass to be up 22%, that's not by accident. We're running significantly more marketing events and concerts and programs. We are really looking at continuing to drive that business. And I believe we are taking a large share of the core mass relative to our unit base, so with our -- roughly 300 games of each play. So Wynn Macau will be perfectly positioned to continue to take additional share in core mass starting in 2020 as we finish that program.\nAnd I just like to again remind everybody, the premium business is not going away. We've all seen this over many, many years in 2016, and 2012, when it artificially contacts for a very short period of time and people focused on core, and then it expands quite rapidly. So what we're not going to do is change who we are. We are the premium operator and we will continue to be the premium operator. But during this time, we are capturing I think more than our fare share of the core mass growth."]]]
