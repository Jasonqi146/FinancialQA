So if I take what you've said about the impact of basically the growth of Juul, this is Slide 8, and equate that to cigarettes, it looks like the Juul has grown about 0.4 billion units, which equates essentially to a full percent market share growth. And that's true for the whole e-cigarettes or e-vapor category. And yet you've also said that the impact of the growth of e-vapor on cigarettes is about 1.3%, 1.4%.

So I know that you laid out that you don't have the RIA business and that might be the reason but you knew you didn't have the RIA business when you laid the targets out, so there are a lot of investors that have got involved in your stock based upon target, setting the targets or pursuing a sale.

You've also shown very clearly all these distribution losses. I'm going to boil it down. I think, what I think you're trying to tell us that I need you to course correct me.

One of the questions I get on this space in general is how do we get out of the pendulum cycle, where for a certain period of time, companies in the food space focus on margins and then for a certain period of time they focus on sales, and they may have to invest to get those sales, it feels like from a General Mills\u2019 perspective, right now Mills is focusing more on the topline willing to sacrifice some margin in the short term, when do we, in your view, get to the period where we have sustainable topline growth and margin growth where you are not necessarily investing more every year to get to that topline growth."]], [" The 3% to 5% revenue growth, and talking about maybe being at the lower end of that in 2018, does that include the change in revenue recognition?", ["Thanks.

I guess, the question I have to -- for Bill is, in terms of cash flow, finance receivables was about $175 million of cash, I think in 2019, which I believe was down year-over-year, but still obviously was a source of cash, but it was used in fourth quarter.

Okay. Okay. And then secondly, just regarding the changes \u2013 I guess, lack of changes in your EPS guidance, Shawn, I think you made a comment of maybe $0.05 to $0.10 of a headwind from tariffs and then $0.25 to $0.30 from FX.

You see the acceleration in price recovery now expected this year whereas previous couple of calls, you are at a $50 million to $60 million gap, if you just look at commodity inflation versus price.

So my understanding is that last year you spent about $3 billion there with about half of that money actually coming from your clients, so not actually Intel Capital being deployed. So if you had $1.5 billion build out of Intel Capital deployed memory last year. If I look at your guide and think logic is slightly up, memory is going to be slightly down.

But then you also have all your other brands within chocolate, and they seem to be more of a drag. So I'm just curious, as we look out in a few years, if you say - let's say, in '18, then probably more of the spending or marketing would go to higher ROI brands that are perhaps larger, you'd get a better lift.

The cost performance has been really exceptional, probably unprecedented versus historical standards. You've been able to keep costs at pretty flattish for -- assuming your guidance holds 4 years here.

It seems like you have provided a range that's maybe in the 850 million to 1.25 million tons of lithium demand in 2025 and 610 million of that would be coming from the EV side. And then you also provided supply of your own capacity being 325 million to 350 million."]], [" But is there anything you're doing maybe amping up a little bit of marketing just given everything that's gone on here year-to-date and maybe the increased uncertainty as to how that could or could not impact other areas, thankfully it hasn't so far, is there any component of that in your spending? And then also related to the cost, can you quantify for us the Grand Bahama impact to the equity income or just some ballpark area as well as the wildfires and the other geopolitical items?", ["Thank you and thank you for the color gentlemen, just a couple more. Jason you'd said that obviously as you continue to ramp up the technology component of your CAPEX that does have a shorter depreciable life. And then that's where some of the additional spending is occurring along with some employee costs in 2020."]], [" I was curious, if you could just talk about sort of early learnings and differences in consumer behaviors, how they interact with those devices as opposed to mobile search and the phones?", ["Thanks for taking my question there. I have two. The first one, the Google Assistant and the Hardware and Google Mini."]], [" So how much kind of thought and allocation went into that number or is it just kind of putting an average gross margin on it firstly?", ["Just one question on page 21 of your presentation today, you gave us a EPS allocation which is very helpful by the way that EPS bridge. Given that EPS allocation for the net EPS impact of volume loss, and I am wondering you multiply that out, it looks like you have $0.09 you gave us at 15 million bucks it's 31 odd percent which is roughly about your gross margin. I am trying to understand though within that, I would think maybe if it were some of the lower margin products you were eliminating maybe some and certainly the 21% decline in incremental sales that contribution margin might be a little bit lower."]], [" But shouldn't that recover in terms of revenues in 2019?", [" And I know you're not guiding 2018 let alone 2019. But 2018, 2019 $10 billion cash from operations, there are a lot of reasons why next year is relatively below your 3% to 5% long-term growth."]], [" Can you just talk how it's trending and do you still feel like that's the appropriate amount?", ["Two questions from me, the first I just want to go back to the supply conversation, just given some of the rising costs and just the overall limited amount of quality intra land sites that are out there. I'm wondering if you can comment on how much of new supply being built today is really just not competitive or a threat to your U.S. portfolio just given all the repositioning you've done at this point. And then the second one is one for Tom just on guidance. I just have the DCT portfolio under roof for a few months now. I think originally you're expecting about $0.07 of accretion in 2019 from that."]], [" The question is does the progress on synergies thus far cause you to think differently about the linearity with which you expect to realize the $150 million in cost gains from the two companies?", ["Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on your execution as you get started in the new area with Linear Tech. My question is regarding the synergies for the combined company. It\u2019s clear, Vincent, that the company is quite happy with the way the early combined work is going."]], [" From your perspective, are you doing this from competitive response what you're seeing in the marketplace? Or is this your philosophical view of the world? Customers demanding a more integrated omni-channel approach and more transparent pricing between channels?", ["Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Follow -- actually follow-up on the omni-channel initiative, so from our vantage point, I think, you're probably a little more forward looking company in the industry right now. We're witnessing here I think greater buy online, pick up in store discounts. You just talked about you are incentivizing your local managers to encourage customers to Ship to Home, when it makes sense to do."]], [" First, Jim, could you talk about the AVOD Opportunity?", ["Thank you. Good morning. I want to touch on the direct-to-consumer streaming stuff and obviously take advantage of Jim being on the call."]], [" Considering the many moving parts at AbbVie, what is your appetite right now for a big deal and would you consider an unfriendly one?", [" And then, lastly, perhaps in part due to AbbVie\u2019s openness to do a deal and its desire to have another therapeutic vertical, there's been some speculation that AbbVie might pursue a big deal, even in an unfriendly way."]], [" Is there something different versus that statement I guess or that 8-K that we looked at versus what you will now see can bridge that at all for us?", [" And then, Mark\u2019s approach, he encouraged us to use one in five, [ph] more than $80 million on a run rate."]], [" So does that really imply that next year you are going to be in the lower half of that range that you have talked about for sure? Presumably the tailwind that you picked up from the risk adjusters being a little better as of the fourth quarter reconciliations doesn\u2019t help you that much? And then finally, does this have anything to do with the Iowa Medicaid claim payments that you were delayed?", ["Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just want to belabor the point on the MLR guidance for the HICS business one more time just to make sure I fully understand what you are saying. You have talked about being in the range of 5% to 10%, but you have trimmed back that guidance into that range a couple of times now, so it seems like you are probably in the mid to the lower half of that range. You talked about for next year still some non-material moderation of that."]], [" Tracey, when you talk about the $50 million of COGS inflation for 2018, is that net of any impact from the step up in amortization and in D&A? And then also a change in pension accounting, I think, geographically might take some the $27 million of pension income out of COGS and move it below the operating profit line? So just wanted to understand if that's a net number?", ["I guess I have one clarification and one question."]], [" Should we expect that to be the base case for EBIT dollar growth next year? Or should we assume that some of that needs to get reinvested maybe with some of the Asia businesses that you took in-house? And then on top of that, is there an expectation of when we should start to think about comps maybe flattening out and turning positive for that brand next year?", ["So Victor, I have a question about the Kate Spade business. You gave guidance for run rate synergies that we can look out relative to the EBIT number you expect this year. I think it's an incremental $65 million to $70 million."]], [" So can you talk about are you pushing more price through that business? Are your input costs coming down meaningfully? Maybe just kind of parse out how you're getting that margin and what the right way to think about FMT margins are kind of going forward at what you're calling kind of a more subdued general industrial environment for that business?", ["Got it. And then just back maybe to FMT margins, up $270 million sequentially. Up, I think -- or $270 million year-over-year, up $170 million sequentially. On a sequential basis, that's on lower revenue."]], [" What's the opportunity there? Because I thought that as part of the combination of these two assets, Hillshire and legacy Tyson, you know, that's also a major source of synergies, right?", ["Okay. And then just, you know, looking at the long-term opportunities in Prepared Foods, obviously, you've been investing in growth, and the numbers are showing in the Nielsen data. There's this issue with the legacy private label business which seems to come up every couple of years. I mean, at one point I think that business had a 5.5% margin, but for the last several years, it's been in the low-single digits."]], [" And then secondly, what is the price assumption now for the year for 2018?", [" So, on $1 billion dollars, first of all, is that net of cannibalization. It sounds like there was some cannibalization here in Q4 or Q3 I should say, and so what would be that near-term in terms of the impact, how we should be thinking about that, and just clarity on that $1 billion."]], [" I guess specifically, how do you think about the potential change to Part D as it relates to J&J?", ["My first one's a broader one on the pharma market. I'd just be interested in your views on Medicare Part D reform and a potential shift away from drug rebates over time."]], [" Is some of that development spend or properties that are bought that ultimately can be repositioned?", [" I know development was thrown in there."]], [" I'm just wondering, what is -- what actually changed in the mix from Jamie, when you originally thought would be break even to the loss?", ["Okay. I think we were targeting break even in capital this year and we ended up losing money."]], [" But do many -- or really any of these shipments move into 2018? And how much cost out can -- how much can cost out help you stabilizes the business in 2018 and beyond?", ["Hey, good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow up on Steve's question on power. When we step back and look at the entire business, obviously you've taken a reset here in guidance. And when you look at the business in terms of AGPs, aero units, just the total services, we know you don't want to give us specifics on 2018 yet, and you've already talked about expecting a tough 2018."]], [" It sounds like you're ramping up for peak season, but as we start to move into 2018, how should that cadence to sort of these cost headwinds as you roll out Saturday and build up the Domestic network look?", ["Hey, great. Thanks, and good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask about some of the cost headwinds that we've seen in the Domestic segment. It looks like you're pulling forward maybe some costs into the fourth quarter with $60 million, which is up from the third quarter's performance. I guess I just wanted to get a sense how we should be thinking about maybe beyond fourth quarter."]], [" What is reason everybody else get wrong here in terms of that fourth quarter trend?", ["The commercial segment, more important question here, the commercial segment had a really strong fourth quarter. I know there were some seasonal items and some timing items and I think that point through the call today maybe address this in generally, but I\u2019m hoping for a lot more detail on this north of $50 million revenue bid in the fourth quarter compared to street models."]], [" So anyway that to sort of think about one in EPS impact from that delay shipment was?", ["Yes, hi good morning. Walt or Mike, so I just want to be clear on the hurricane impact on the possible capital side, so you obviously said $5 million, what's the right way to think about the organic constant currency growth then for the quarter, if you kind of adjust for those shipments that you didn't get and I know volume plays a very large part in the equation here particularly on the capital side."]], [" And I was wondering if you guys could kind of address how you guys think about how the market would react to a similar announcement at AT&T?", ["Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first kind of a bigger picture question with respect to the DTC strategy, Randall, or John Stankey, if he's on. A couple of weeks ago we saw Disney launch a DTC product or announce a launch with lower-than-expected pricing, bigger than expected losses. Numbers came down and the stock jumped 10% because people were looking at this as kind of a standalone Netflix being incubated inside Disney."]], [" And I\u2019m wondering if you can sort of give us a flavor for how much flexibility that might enable for 2018 and then looking into 2019 as well?", ["Thanks a lot for the questions, guys. Wanted to just touch on the $400 million to $500 of minimum MLR rebates. I\u2019m sort of curious to understand whether that had anything to do with sort of pricing plans for the all tax regime and what that could mean for 2019. And relatedly on the incremental investments side of things these were described as accelerated programs in the release."]], [" I guess can you give a little color on the mark-to-market leasing for the rest of the New York portfolio? And I guess, was 767 the only space with a rent roll-down this quarter?", ["So if I heard you correctly, you said that the rent roll-down at 767 was about 50% on a net basis. But overall, New York City was only down about 4%."]], [" A, is that right in terms of potentially the CapEx that you could incrementally spend? And b, when would you convey that to us and the investment community in terms of what kind of opportunities you see for potential increase in CapEx in those outer years?", ["Okay. Second question, just clarifying your comments from earlier. So as you mentioned, you're fairly confident in the earnings growth that you've laid out for us through 2023, which by definition implies that the growth in that '21 through '23 period of roughly 5%-or-so is exceeding what your current rate base growth would be from the current CapEx plan, which is in the 2% to 3% range. So it appears that you run the math and you've identified potentially the levers already that would keep you in that growth trajectory."]], [" Can you just quantify how big is the customer deposits benefit in that change in cash flow? And then when we talk about -- we felt we were going to have $150 million headwind from factoring and now not, is that mean that we've been factoring now so this is an ongoing benefit? Or is this sort of we've found some offsets for this year but we stop that factoring headwind to think about in the future years?", ["Pat -- I wanted to pop on some of the cash flow things."]], [" As the growth continues what type of incremental do y you think the business will have on it, and when is that going to be above corporate average in car, materially accretive from a bottom line perspective?", ["Want to focus on your active safety business, I think with those 57% revenue growth probably around 900 million, how does that compare from a margin perspective for 2018 relative to corporate average."]], [" I am wondering if you could sort of help us bridge that gap from the flat in 2020 just to a more elevated pace in same-store in 2021, you have got the what\u2019s likely to be the 125 of contractual rent growth, the 75 basis point contribution from rent spreads, but then how does \u2013 how should we be thinking about the redevelopment contribution in 2021 given all the moving pieces and also the recovery in rent paying occupancy from the bankruptcies and move-outs that you\u2019re experiencing this year?", ["Hi, thanks. Good morning. Lisa and Mike, you both mentioned in your prepared remarks about commenting on sort of getting back to that 3% same-store NOI, 4% FFO growth in 2021 and beyond. I think a lot of us are sort of looking to 2021 now given the flattish growth expectations in 2020. And Mike you sort of laid out those components."]], [" But on the back end, do you think there's an opportunity to leverage your US assets? Or do you need to put discrete assets in Canada, and maybe any of the case studies that you've looked at, as you think about that market and obvious similarities that you can emulate or some clear misses from strategies you've seen from these closures?", ["Okay, let me \u2013 if I can sneak one more and you've seen with Canada, I know, we are -- just not good in that. A couple of US retailers have gone up to Canada. And I think the results have been fairly mixed. But, one thing that's been a tougher thing to figure out is, how much they can lean on US infrastructure versus building discrete assets to service Canada. I know, you don't want to get into the competitive aspects here."]], [" And what actually for large-screen OLED?", ["You guys discussed the growing number of programs for large-screen LCD in your pipeline.

And so first of all, if we think about bridging the cash from, if we thought about kind of $3.5 billion or so of operating cash flow this year and then not having to -- no pension contributions would probably get you pretty close to 7. And then, your underlying operating profit growth is probably another 200 or so after tax. And then, the working capital kind of takes that -- takes a little bit of chunk out of that.

And I appreciate that good traction in the 14 terabyte."]], [" So, what will it take to get the step function trend down say a couple of hundred basis points beyond all the good work that you've already done?", ["Hi. Good morning. More of a bigger picture question. When I look at drug costs being well under control, down maybe under 1%, hospital base flat, just millions of point solutions popping out for every healthcare spend category you can think of.

And it's been one of the strong points in the portfolio each quarter so far this year, despite some of the weather headwinds. So it's a bit of a two-part question. The first one is, one of the areas of strength on production this quarter was on the higher gas and NGL volumes and you mentioned that part of that was the Little Missouri 4 plant startup and part of that was the POP contracts, some of which reverses into the fourth quarter."]], [" Can you comment on the notion that the future is bright for global demand, given the unprecedented 30% plus or minus reduction in the herd size in China?", ["I think I'll switch gears and maybe take a step back and ask the question about the fundamentals."]], [" Can you help us understand when you say stable benefit, does that literally means stable including premiums and the bulk of that differential has to get absorbed in earnings? Is that the message you're conveying today?", ["Hi. Good morning. Kind of want to hit on the same point, maybe just in a little more detail. So if I'm understanding kind of how you're talking about 2018, there's roughly $0.50 of outperformance, the $11.50 versus the $11 you talked about, to invest in 2018. There's roughly $2.15 of excess HIF tax benefit that you'll be able to invest in benefits because you're not pulling that through operating earnings this year. So that's a little less than $3, and we think the hit is coming back at you to about a $4 headwind. So when we think about how that plays out in 2018, either you have to absorb the differential in terms of lower earnings growth, you have to reduce benefits, you have to cut G&A or you have to raise premium."]], [" So two questions, would that surprise you, that valuation, and if it made sense to see what it was worth back then, why doesn't it make sense to do the same thing now?", ["Yes. Thank you very much. So, Doug, back in 2007 when you were running Airways, you said at the time you were talking to some bankers to get a sense of what the loyalty program could be worth. We've spoken to a couple of guys in private equity and they would use about a 15 times EBITDA multiple on it. That puts the valuation somewhere around $30 billion to $40 billion. Your market cap is half that."]], [" And then second, what is the main message that you as a leadership team are sending out to the field this year?", [" I am just interested in this price increase that you recently put through if you can talk about maybe magnitude and timing of the effect on both the top line and the gross margin as it flows through, that\u2019s one."]], [" I guess, is there room to do more given a more challenging obviously revenue backdrop and sort of flattish organic growth here?

Is it the stock price or is it something else you're watching to see whether you are higher-end or lower-end of that range?", ["Thanks. Good morning. The first question I had was just on buybacks. I think you mentioned you're still committed to your $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion range for \u2013 or $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion range for 2017. That implies a significant pickup in buybacks from what you've been doing in the last few quarters, and I think roughly for $300 million to $500 million in the fourth quarter based on your range."]], [" But my question is, when you look out over the next couple of years in the $6 billion in free cash flow how much of that do you expect to return to shareholders versus going to pay down debt or the pension?

Well in the U.S. looking at the volume and price, I had thought looking at 2012, when you guys got about 5% price, which is where you're kind of running, volumes in the industry or your volumes actually had fallen 5% that year, realizing there's Canada and Mexico in there. Do you think the elasticity we saw in 2Q where you got price, volume was very weak, now you outpace the market with 5% price. Is there elasticity after a certain period of price introduction, which is to say you're gaining share, is that because the price increase has abated and/or we receive lots of questions from clients about the Koreans, LG, Samsung perhaps having run out of pre-tariff product."]], [" as a way to drive traffic?", ["And earlier this year, I think you reduced the advertising spend in the U.S. as part of the rollout of the $1 $2 $3 Menu. Do you think that's at all a root cause of perhaps some of the weaknesses or said another way, is there a need to reinvest in some advertising dollars in the U.S."]], [" And then, also on YouTube, anything around new products or features driving the monetization or ad business?", ["Thanks for taking my questions. One for Sundar and for Ruth. Sundar, on YouTube, you mentioned that 1.5 billion people come to YouTube. Any other information you can give us there on user growth or engagement trends would be great, anything on time spent, I mean particularly as YouTube becomes more mature and mobile video particularly in North America gets more competitive."]], [" Is the impact currently largely contained to Asia Pacific or is there demand softness in other markets as well?", [" And then, the second question about coronavirus."]], [" And then I guess more importantly, any sense you can give us on where you think this puts you relative to others in the market where you're competing for our hourly wage earners?", [" I think you said it would start in fiscal '19."]], [" Do you think you really have enough time to get all of your review and analysis and study of cost and benefits and actions done by the end of the quarter that we\u2019re currently in?", ["Hi, everyone. Good morning. Bill, again thanks for all of the detail and the commentary. I guess I had to top down types of questions, first of all, if the call down effort from your customers began, it sounded like an earnest in March which then triggered all of the internal activity occurring at Bemis."]], [" What should we expect in the second half in terms of warehouse and workflow solutions sales trends specifically? Do you expect to pick up from Q2 as some of those orders get realized, or you\u2019re leaving it as sort of a single digit growth assumption for now?", ["Great, thank you for that detail. Maybe just picking up on your last point, Darius, within SPS, the warehouse and workflow solutions piece, revenue growth there was 7% in Q2 after 50% growth in Q1."]], [" And is it costs coming into the platform, or is it the inability to take costs out due to some of the factors you're describing here with the Tier 2s?", ["Just hoping you could help me get my head around something here. So the midpoint of your full year EBIT guidance came down by $55 million on an $81 million revision to revenue, if I use the midpoint of revenue guidance. So it looks like the bigger change to your expectations were on the cost side. And if I do a simple bridge, the first half decremental margin on the revenue decline was 23%. But if I do the same math on the second half, it's 38%. And maybe you can just elaborate a little bit more on, it seems like this is a cost thing."]], [" I guess at what point you put this in Cable Communications, do you wait until this is profitable?", ["I've two questions for Mike and then one for Steve. So first Mike, it's sounds like XFINITY Mobile is staying in corporate."]], [" Does that guidance include what we've seen so far year-to-date in the equity markets, which has been pretty robust or is that a potential offset if it proves to be durable through the quarter?", ["Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Eric, you just ran through a bunch of color on expectations for the year in 1Q. One that I was hoping to dig a little in on is the fee revenue side. I think you said that the 1Q fee revenue growth down 2% to 3% sequentially, and you gave a couple of factors."]], [" Does it make sense for us to start thinking about your long-term target being closer to the high 20s or 30%? Or how should we think about that?", [" That also continued to do quite well, and as a result, you're pulling through again, it looks like, for the December quarter, total operating margins that look to be well above your long-term target."]], [" So yes, short question is basically, will you increase your actual dollars in that investment to get to a point to hopefully improve your margin over time, I guess, driven by volume leverage?", [" And I just asked because, as Jason alluded to, kind of your operating margin structure relative to other peers, so to speak, is a little bit lower. Obviously, that has given mix, what have you. But on an advertising basis and brand support, it's not as if Kellogg historically was one that was like massively under investing."]]]
