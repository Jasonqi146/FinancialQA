Just the first one on I think if as I look at your franchise revenue growth in the domestic side this quarter, it was up about 5% even though you had a 4% increase in units and a 4% comp, can you maybe explain what sort of dragged down that, because I know you took the fees up on your franchisees on the digital side versus last year."]], [" When you think out, Mark, over the next couple of years and the product innovation you're seeing from Google, the intent from some of your hotel partners to get more direct traffic, your desire to get more direct traffic, shared accommodation, what are some of the investments you're making?

So if I look at the divisional profit results ex-corporate expense, you were down 3.5% year-over-year in the quarter, get results can bounce around quarter-to-quarter but it's also down 3% on average in the last three quarters despite ad spend being down in that timeframe."]], [" So, aside from the volume growth issue, what\u2019s managed so differently internationally versus domestically?", [" You\u2019re still putting a new ERP system there, other than the \u2013 I mean the only thing that I can see that\u2019s markedly different is the fact that the volume\u2019s still are growing there."]], [" So does it sort of stabilize here or is there a bit more to go in terms of the mix shift?", ["Hi.

First, on the resource side, I think that sales and margin surprised people a little, while the overall quarter was fairly good. You talked about warranty. You talked about production cuts."]], [" So, I was just curious when you speak to your ability, your firepower willingness to do deals, let\u2019s say do you foresee more assets actually coming to market by giving you more options to potentially acquire or at this point, does there seem to be somewhat fine line pipeline?", ["Okay thank you. Sean this is just a very general question for you, any incremental color just basically on the M&A environment in general, I think would be helpful for everyone.

So it\u2019s only the incremental part on loan growth that goes up by 30%, 40%.

Congrats on a strong finish to the year. I just wanted to kind of ask a little bit about some of the revenue forecast that you're making, so two very quick things; one, given your first quarter guidance of about 2 to 2.5, can you just walk us through in as much detail as you're willing to provide some of the incremental headwinds that you're seeing in Q1 or that you're forecasting in Q1 versus the 3."]], [" Where do you expect the tech spend to go?", ["And then part of the solution to that, as you've mentioned, is getting more efficient, reduced headcount 4 quarters in a row and really technology.

It's the more food that you put on, the more your gross margins contract, and we're just not seeing it on the bottom line of operating income for the entire division."]], [" So I am just curious why maintain the guidance of zero to 2% for same store NOI growth in 2017?", ["Congrats on the quarter. I know it's a very tough backdrop but the execution looks pretty good. Quick two questions from my end. The first one is, 1Q is a seasonally slower quarter.

I wanted to start out just a couple of questions around North American volumes and maybe a follow-up about your last comment on, Jim around units, but just in the quarter, with volumes a bit weak it seems like on the major appliance side a little below what [indiscernible] said, and then I think we all were expecting some rebound in small appliance shipments, just given the timing shifts you had indicated last quarter."]], [" Given the shareholder-friendly actions that you guys have initiated today, is that basically trying to provide incremental line of sight to us in terms of how that cash flow or free cash flow will expand?

I am going to leave others to sort of follow-up on the cash flow point, because I am sure they will. I wanted to jump if I could to Stuart, your commentary about technology and Open Door as I imagine you probably expect I would, I was very intrigued to hear what you had to say about that, because obviously I share your enthusiasm about what can happen there. But I was wondering if you could talk specifically about your investments across these technology initiatives, you said, they weren\u2019t just investments but rather a strategy.

Maybe just start on installation cycles and a backlog question, I think Gary you mentioned in your prepared comments just I think installations on Edge accelerated, to how much are you seeing a faster installation cycle benefit or come through to that 4% to 7% top line outlook.

So Steve, my question is really around the cost of top line growth. So if you look at 2019 guidance, you're only assuming 1% to 2% organic sales growth that's coming despite two years of investment beginning in 2018, and that's at the low end of your long-term range.

You showed continued efficiency gains into '20. If I divide the midpoint of your core CapEx, it\u2019s like about 315 of your top guide of around 360.

And are we back to normal in 2020?", ["Okay, much appreciated. And then just a couple of fine points. Within the broader pharma outlook, it's safe to say we can hold up double-digit growth in bioprocess, just as a follow-up to that prior. And then I wonder if you could speak to how things played out over the course of 2019 and how you're thinking about 2020 as it relates to, at the corporate level, price increases year-on-year.

More and more of what our clients actually come to us with, and this is a point Eric and Mike were making, they come to us with implications on how technology changes the business model but also changes the risk profile, and in a number of respects, increases the risk profile. And at this point in time, with technology change, even if they think they have it figured it out, there's massive uncertainty. So for us, this is the perfect time to sort of be in a changing global economy in which there is so much change going on, and risk overall is going up. By the way, it's not just risk in the classic risk business. It's risk in the retirement world. It's risk in the health world. So it really is volatility in the world today that we think is greater than ever before. I described intellectual property.

In North and Central America bev, you talked about overall volumes up 5%. I was wondering if it's possible to parse that out between U.S. and Mexico, and maybe other markets.

Just stepping back for a second, I think you and Deb really have clearly laid out the various headwinds that you faced in the quarter and maybe some of those -- well, obviously, some of those were not expected when you talked to us in July.

Particularly, how do you balance the opportunity to return to a share repurchase program versus reinvesting in some of the growth opportunities you were talking about over the course of this call?", ["As your Cable business becomes increasingly connectivity driven, it certainly seems like the margin profile is going to keep improving. And as Mike alluded to, the CapEx profile is also likely to continue improving as well. And so what that implies is that, that business' natural ability to delever is probably going to be greater in the future than it has been in the past, and that could maybe get you back to your pre-Sky leverage profile a bit quicker. But I think that, really, on a recurring basis, it implies that business might just be creating more excess capital over the long term than we've seen.

I want to ask a broader question about the margin guidance for 2018. So, you guys are calling for roughly 6% revenue growth and meaningful part of that should come from the freight aftermarket business which as you noted earlier is a high margin business. And I understand there is some transitory project cost that are continuing in 2018, but that there should be subsiding towards the back half of the year.

I get the seasonal lift H1 to H2, it does seem that the comparisons of legacy Tyco especially but even JCI BE organically are a bit harder as we move into the back as particularly the June quarter."]], [" So just trying to square those two things relative to the overall amount coming down compared to what you are suggesting is going on with the Pharma segment for the rest of the year?", ["Okay, great. And then I guess, Mike, if I could just go over to the guidance. Overall, it looks like the range is coming down by $0.11 at the midpoint. You talked a lot about generic inflation getting a little bit worse than previously thought and then modestly less branded inflation. But if I look at the guidance for the Pharma segment specifically, it seems like that take down in what you are assuming around profit margins there or overall profits there, mid to high single-digits, would actually indicate something more in the $0.25 to $0.40 headwind."]], [" Is this the kind of year where you can get sort of the high end of that because of what's going on in the truckload market? Or should we maybe sort or pull the 2 of them apart and think about it more specifically to LTL?", ["I want to come back to pricing a little bit, and I think a lot of us kind of have questions of trying to relate what's going on in LTL to what's happening in the truckload market. And obviously, there's tightness there, and we're seeing rate increases coming in higher than typical sort of normal rate increases would see. So as we think about that relationship, could you kind of help us a little bit, maybe frame it up with the 3.5% to 4% annual price increases x fuel."]], ["03 dilution still valid for 2017?", [" And related to that, in the past, you told us that you resumed about a $0.03 earnings dilution from the asset sale primarily from the timing.

I get and I understand the opportunity for distribution expansion for so many of the brands in so many new markets. And I see why that will drive a third of your growth, and that's great. But my concern is that you are gaining more market share, it seems, through distribution expansion as opposed to with your own innovation. And I look at your two really big new products over the last year: New Dimensions and Est\u00e9e Edit, which we heard about for several quarters before they were launched. They were supposed to be game-changers. New Dimensions was supposed to set off a whole new category. Est\u00e9e Edit was supposed to revitalize the brand with millennials. And both of those brands have fallen well short of your expectations. And I know it may take time, and Est\u00e9e Edit may be a slow build, and all that kind of stuff. But my bigger question, Fabrizio, and you even mentioned it at Barclays, that the company is changing its focus less from blockbuster home runs, successful new product innovations, and more smaller things. But I'm just wondering how big a change that is culturally."]], [" Understood and just last one from me and might be a better question too for Steve but just given the duration profile and the securities look can you remind us what's the net yield take up that you are getting on the securities today given the steepening of the curve versus the what you are running on the cash rates?", ["Okay so it is $30 million rate benefit which shows up in both, got it. Okay."]], [" How should investors think about the composition in terms of Enterprise? Will Enterprise still continue to be your top one or two vertical?

So my question really is around the glide path for 2018 full year revenue growth of the mid 20s."]], [" I think one of the things investors are grappling with is, what portion of that $700 million will eventually flow to the bottom line, and to what extent is the investment in innovation that you flagged just the cost of doing business? Is there a market share, whether it's in retail or food service that you're targeting, at which point we'll see that inflection in margins?", ["So I just wanted to ask about Hillshire and follow-up on some of your comments and maybe if we can circle in on a net synergy number."]], [" Can you share with us your thoughts as to the cadence of how that would come over without obviously giving no guidance per say, but how does that flow of earnings look for you over, let's say, the next two to three years for nutrition?", ["Okay, thank you everyone. Just two really quick follow-ups. One, so funds for one. The nutrition business is really kind of a fall into Ken's question. The nutrition business is really starting to hit full stride here. Consistent with your comments that what happened several years ago and I think your goal is that or your belief is that this division can be as much as 25% of total corporate profits. So if you look at last year's number of your total segment profits, that's roughly a double from here at some point."]], [" So, what am I missing there in that math?", ["Good morning. First up, Kirk, I guess just wanted to clarify the slide 12 numbers you gave us, as you walked from the pro forma to the actual guidance for 2018.

And also want to clarify that you said at least 50 basis point improvements versus in 2019, would that imply on the old accounting or new accounting?", ["Okay, that's great. My second question is on the margin.

I guess, kind of on a related topic, could you talk a little bit about what if anything the Hulu sale might mean to the financials of the business."]], [" And just related to that real quick, can you just remind us, TMC and the national exchange, are there market data feeds that are coming in now as well from the acquisition? Could you give us a million dollar number on that too as well?", ["Yeah. Hey, good morning, everyone. Wanted to come back to the data guidance and outlook, Scott. And by the way, first of all, thanks for some of the incremental disclosures. It's really helpful. But I just wanted to compare the previous guidance with the new guidance. So I think for the full year, previously, you said 6% or 7% organic and I know this included currency beforehand. But even then, I think you said even without currency, should be at the 6%. So now you're saying 5% to 6%. You mentioned a couple of items like the audit fees and also the implementation. But just wondering if you could highlight any other things that maybe have been running a little bit slower. I know you've been very excited throughout the year. And in particular I think some people thought Europe and MiFID II could draw some upside.

So even if I assume like $51 billion this year, which it sounds like it\u2019s probably going to be at least that, if not higher. Other guys are saying $52 billion or $53 billion. It still looks like based upon your guidance for the fiscal Q1 that you\u2019re still going to lose a little bit of WFE share this year after losing a little bit last year as well. Now maybe that $51 billion number is too high or something. But even if I look at the 2020 model, your comments on that, you said SSG is going to still be about $11.6 billion or higher, which is in line with your model. But your old model was at $45 billion WFE.

So, is it, what are the kinds of things that you\u2019re thinking about that would accelerate that strategy from an M&A perspective?", ["Okay, great. And then my second follow-up would just be around the comments on the acquisition strategy. Clearly, a lot of questions today around your partnerships and what you have in the marketplace.

First question is, as you think about the, OpEx improvements beyond '19 and normalized capital spending. I know that as part of the culture change, you've seen the headquarters shift in the last five years, you've completed the transformation of getting the business where you want, and importantly, you all were doing quite a bit of work to get to zero, I guess breakeven at the bottom and a lot of that's already been done, so my question is, as we go out beyond '19.

I know it's early days."]], [" So just can you comment broadly on how confident you are that in your ability to say hit sort of mid-teen returns in those businesses?", [" Obviously, if you can sustain those kinds of returns, it goes a long way towards helping you hit your 12% RoTCE targets on a sustainable basis."]], [" What are the common traits of stores that are seeing the most success with it?

For 5-nanometer and below, though, it's kind of interesting because I think at the recent SPIE technical symposium, I think the KLA team actually talked about a multi-beam e-beam platform for EUV reticle inspection targeted at 5 nanometers and below."]], [" And then secondly, I think you mentioned that the delivery rollout in the first couple of big markets has led to mid-single digit percentage of product mix, is that all incremental or are you seeing a mid-single digit lift in the sales or is that cannibalizing some of the in-store sales? And how does that compare to what you expected as you started the rollout?", ["My question is on China, and I just -- maybe it's a two part question. First is, holding the line on comps sequentially despite I guess some signs of a slower macro economy over there.

You're pricing guides were down 2% and this is after a quarters and quarters and quarters the accommodation and no price wars when we heard children that this question we really just ask this question. And by the way it only becomes positive it sounds like sometime in that fiscal year and towards the pricing but that doesn\u2019t feel good. You said look we are 8 out of 10 are good, and two of them are not good into your categories but there is always through they are not good right. I mean it just seems like there is always something at P&G as some calorie combinations are doing well which impacts the whole business it hasn\u2019t come together we get that but I guess why will it now continues to be the question we ask and if you look at as that business is neutral but we have heard some form and that business is real for at least five years. So I guess what if the strategy doesn\u2019t work, what if the world is actually two dramatically different HPC you start look like packaged foods for investors perspective what is Plan B.

That starts to make a bit more sense, and I appreciate the emphasis that oil doesn\u2019t gets hit. Thank you for that. My follow-up is, so not to be too predictable, it\u2019s obviously on Guyana. And I know we have the Exxon Analyst Day on March 5, so to the extent you can share. It seems that the appraisal activity focus around Turbot is probably, I\u2019m guessing, is to define what the scale of that development is going to look like over time.

Or is there anything else going on here like capacity constraints in Spinosyns? Or is there any area where you might be losing some market share?", ["Yes, thank you. You had a few of your crop chemical peers post results in the last couple of days. And one area that seems to reflect a differential result is Latin America, where you had peers that posted some pretty strong volumes in contrast to yours. And I just wanted to get your view on that. You did note that there was some volume pull into the second quarter and a little bit of a push into the fourth quarter."]], [" So where do you think we are cyclically as it relates to industry Air Freight supply/demand? Has that helped International parcel yields at all and what are your second half peak expectations from an Air Freight point of view?", ["Hey, good morning, guys. A question for Jim. Jim, you touched on this earlier sort of the International Air Freight capacity dynamics. I'm curious where you think the industry is in kind of in the context of the broader cycle. We've had several years of excess capacity in that globally on the Air Freight side. It seems as though it's tightened up. Load factors have improved.

Then the final question is there's a lot of other things going on in China. And I think we've talked a little bit about this. Now you've got -- their corn inventories have fallen quite sharply. I believe they were as many as much as 230 million metric tons four, five years ago, and maybe that's now below 100 million metric tons.

I think, you mentioned that you expect it to be plus 3%, despite the tougher comparison, but I wasn't sure how to interpret that in light of your comment about the initiatives needing to work.

And how should we think about the first quarter expectation?", ["Understood. And I agree, the $8.5 billion of other net inflows definitely speak volume to your -- the demand for your product. My second question is related to the weak non-coupon investment income in the quarter. My understanding is that most of your hedge fund exposure has no reporting lag, and the underperformance in the fourth quarter was fully reflected in the numbers in the quarter, so that included the weaker December results."]], [" Then my followup is on the validation of your smart vehicle architecture, this Zone Controller award, is that a business that you were able to win as a result of the two advanced development awards that you have in place, is that the next step from a satellite architecture that you already have in place?", ["Understood."]], [" Why is it being pushed to the right?

I think calendar '16 was to be investment year, '17 a year of stabilization, and '18 a year of acceleration toward sustainability going forward.

That the industry and ConAgra is facing in the context of the fact that markets value and the entire industry and ConAgra has structurally flawed. So I'd like to ask two questions, one related to the Pinnacle business and one related to the base business in that context right. So you're probably aware of our view, which is that execution is really the big winner for the large CPGs rather than really brand equity erosion. So with Pinnacle, I mean there's a long history here of really good innovation and really good brand building, a very long history and it's been best-in-class, right.

And I want to understand a little bit more on the contingency. So it sounds like the $30 million here the small utilization is more for construction and some of the higher costs to keep the qualified individuals around.

First, when I look at slide 26, which has your CapEx by subsidiary on the regulated and at Southern Power, and if I compare it to the same slide in last year's guidance, so the fourth quarter 2016 five-year outlook, two things stand out. One is that the five-year capital plan for Alabama Power is up materially, $1.5 billion.

But, I guess if you take the other side of it, one of the important things for NAV is it does give you a sense of overall value relative to where a stock is trading. And you sort of dismissed the share buyback question pretty quickly, sinks an arrow in quiver, in your toolkit. The reality is Street NAVs are $50, you think stock is worth 53. Stock\u2019s trading at $41 million. You trade at the widest discount to NAV in the apartment space at almost 20%; your peers are at 10%.

I know that you mentioned that you are offering more flexible options on the Sling and some of those were free, et cetera. So as you think about the improved churn that you\u2019re seeing in the DISH TV offering, I know you talked about the better quality subs. But I wonder how that trade-off is working."]], [" So I guess how do you think about it in terms of what is contributing vis-\u00e0-vis what I just mentioned? And on the Naturals piece, how do you think about the Colgate brand and consumer acceptance of it with a natural positioning relative to what it's historically stood for?", ["Hey, Ian. I wanted to ask about how you think about what's the biggest contributing factor to sales growth and sort of relative share performance when you talk about local competition or Naturals, I know there can be a bit of overlapping there, or contrasting that with multinationals like GSK, who have been putting up high-single-digit-type growth on what is a very big brand."]], [" So I guess, the punch line is, what gives you the confidence that recent pricing intensity is really temporary versus more structural? And what's the risk that you see that you won't be able to fully offset -- or fully get the pricing you want in '18 such that margin aspirations may come under duress as heightened competition doesn't allow full pricing to flow through?", ["But I also think you were targeting like 150 basis points plus in '17 originally, and we finished essentially at 20."]], [" And I was just curious if you could kind of help us frame thoughts around benefits from pricing as well as productivity?", ["On the flip side, you're looking at the $250 million of cost savings. And I was just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about the other positive drivers across volume growth, or sales growth, pricing and productivity.

Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to talk a little bit more about the wine business and suggest any color you can offer, I know you definitely specified kind of the below $11 price point above $11 price point performance of your focus brands, but I was curious on overall category performance and then also the difference between high end and low end.

Miles, I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019d share with us how you see the pacing of the year from here.

You commented on how your install based over the last couple of years has grown 30%.

Yet, if we look at iPhone unit growth for fiscal \u201918 what\u2019s implied with your guidance fiscal \u201917 and fiscal \u201916, it\u2019s been relatively flat. So you have an install base that\u2019s 20% plus higher, and a unit growth that relatively flat, which would suggest that your upgrade rate is going down or your replacement cycle is elongating. And I\u2019m wondering whether you agree with that and whether investors should be worried about that. And maybe if I could just add one other wrinkle to potentially get your response on is. Given consumers\u2019 heightened awareness of their ability to replace batteries going forward as opposed to upgrades."]], [" What sticks out to you all internally?", ["Pat, I wanted to stick on the cash flow here a little bit, but the $7.1 billion in pre-work working capital cash flow seemed to be better than the framework you all gave at the Analyst Day when we adjust for commodity price.

Thank you good morning. Tom, good luck. It\u2019s been a pleasure and hey, you are handling all the ratings here on a high note with all-time margin highs.

I mean, it looks like the messaging, though, from your peers has suggested that the positive beta from here should track more in line with historical levels. They've cited somewhere in the range of 50% to 60%. It felt like with some of the remarks, that essentially the competitive dynamics are really going to dictate or anchor what you guys do on the deposit side.

If possible I was hoping maybe to get a little bit more quantification in bridging either fourth quarter to 1Q or 1Q versus the prior 1Q. If I look at \u2013 I will do it sequentially.

But Karl, maybe a broader question for you just given some of the potential revenue drivers you could have at your back this year, whether it's either hikes or if we see this type of sustained retail activity that would obviously be very helpful as well."]], [" How confident are you that this is the right path?

You\u2019ve talked about not being able to sustainably grow 2% to 3% until 2020, but you're also making progress. So, my way of math is next year's numbers should be somewhere between 2% and 3% on the high-end obviously not going to get there, but better than the growth rates you're putting up in 2018. Could you just talk about the messaging for the fourth quarter, first of all, is that likely to slow from the third quarter, and is it a reasonable assessment to think about 1.5% to 2% next year is somewhere between 18 and 2% to 3%.

Are you seeing improvements in conversion rates for those ads?

As you said, the number of advertising - advertisers using Stories are growing quickly."]], [" I know we get some volume growth, but is there anything that you can think of that would meaningfully change the profitability of the business?

Of course we have a lower tax rate and you\u2019re aggressively buying back stock, lowering the share count and you\u2019ve managed expectations really well.

Yes hi guys. So just want to maybe just address kind of what you\u2019re seeing out there in a bit more detail. It feels like September was a weaker month more broadly. Yet, you saw a nice uptick in September sequentially. So you didn't seem to see that, although you are talking about a great proportion of national accounts, customers are declining. So I'm just wanting to maybe just dig in to sort of feedback you're hearing from branch managers and then more specifically, you called out I think last quarter weakness in heavy industry and oil and gas.

I was just trying to get a sense for the offsetting actions to those headwinds through price, cost, specifically productivity, I think is -- if you want to throw that in there, if you feel that that was either supply chain or other things that you did specifically to offset.

How do you conceptually think about modeling WFE growth over the next three to five years?", ["A classification and a question. On the clarification, Dan, I was hoping you could give us some more color around the subscription versus transactional mix in AGS. So, let us predict how sensitive that business is to WFE versus your increasing base of deployed tools.

That makes sense. And if you think about the quarterly run rate that you guys talked about being around $72 million, I know there is a little bit of elevated legal and regulatory, but it would still imply about 30% growth versus last year.

Thank you. And my follow-up, semi related. It's a regulatory question and we appreciate, I think the market appreciates the total Markets Initiative. But I was just trying to see if you can give us like at least your status update, now looks like things are quiet and we're given a lot of attention to U.S. equities but it look like Chairman Clayton offered a pretty balanced statement in regards to sort of the fee guidance that the trading and markets division and it seems like the access fee pilot and the -- sort of the litigation things have everything on pause."]], [" Is it due entirely to the invoicing seasonality, may be something else going on?", [" And then secondly is the 18%, 19% 3Q DR growth.

And what's actually in the annual guidance for impact from China given it drove a point of growth from last year?", ["Good morning. Just two questions for me. Dan I want to come back to Coronavirus just to sort of set expectations. So by our quick math, China is kind of 5% of the company. Maybe it was a point of growth to 2019. I appreciate the focus in the first quarter.

So you mentioned that basically there was a huge reduction in advertising from roughly $50 million last year to $30 million, so that's about $20 million. Taking a look at what you reported on SG&A, there is a decrease by about $30 million on a quarter over quarter but also on a year over year basis. So my question is I understand that you're likely to be a little more cautious on advertising especially on the Jennie-O side for the remainder of the year. But can we assume that more from the long run that that roughly 10 million savings is something recurring. Do you think there is an opportunity to service a bond and what's your expectation in terms of SG&A for the back half of the year. If you want to express it as a percentage of sales so more in absolute terms, it's just to get a little bit of a sense of how much more savings potential you might have on the U.S."]], [" And the remaining three quarters of the year, would it be fair to expect maybe for the acceleration of the rate change?", ["Hi, good morning everybody.

And at Intel, between the 10 nanometer node and the 7 nanometer node, same thing, a lot of additional EUV layers. I understand you guys remain very well exposed to this new EUV heavy nodes but I image that when you move from multiple patterning to EUV the type of business you get is different."]], [" Do you still have opportunities to take costs out of that freight segment?

On the noninterest income, I know there are a couple of details you called out around lease residual gains and so on. But if you look at the year-on-year comparison; service charges down 3% year-on-year, corporate banking revenues down 9% year-on-year, wealth is up 1%.

And then given the difficult trade environment which you guys are contending with, which shows up in gross to net, it would seem like that would be a part of the strategy to increase that sort of in the balance of the year.

Maybe Dean or Steve or Peter, whoever wants to take this, but just sort of following whole sort of capital discussion.

And then secondly, if I may, on the supply chain, and I know you talked about this in the past, but in terms of the bigger structural changes that are happening in the supply chain, how far are we in this journey at this point. I mean, obviously, you hire new people, you have new teams, you have new office, and you have a completely clean slate in terms of what Chipotle could be in 2020 versus 2015 or 2014.

It may not show up yet just because of the way the severance works."]], [" What are the moving pieces around that and potential upsides? What type of well productivity improvements, if any, have you factored in versus what you're seeing? And how should we think about the natural decline rates in Permian Resources?", ["Great, thanks. And then to shift on my follow-up to the Permian, you're planning an acceleration in the number of Permian Resources wells brought online in the second and third quarters, and you've guided to an acceleration in production and growth in the third and fourth quarters."]], [" Is it fair to assume that you can be more aggressive on buyback to take advantage of the stock price? Or in general, how do you think about when to be more aggressive with your buybacks?", ["Yes, thanks for that information. The next question is on buybacks. You bought back $1.2 billion, right. You\u2019ve been very active in buybacks. So with the trailing 12 months, you still have, I believe you said $18.2 billion left. The stock is down 25% from its highs."]], [" So the longer term issue here is I think investors are concerned that as you take more B2C residential deliveries, obviously, there is less density there, so is that where the margin degradation really is occurring or is there some competitive pressure from the post office, can you guys talk more, because this just feels a little bit more than capacity additions, but maybe we have that all wrong?", ["Yes, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the career, Mike. So Henry or Alan, I guess I want to follow-up on that. Your revenue was up 9% at Ground. Your op income was down 12%, so a delta arguably wider than 20%. And if I look at your major hubs, I think at the end of last year, it was like 33%. So if you add 4% to the mix and we just think about costs, maybe 10% to 15% additional costs from your new hubs, assuming no revenue even comes through them."]], [" So maybe if you can just give some thoughts on the level of conservatism for the year and is that 27% tax rate the right one to extrapolate out to 2018 and beyond? And then, Stanley, I'll take a shot here in terms of when you mentioned net neutral to 2017 the deal with Dentsply Sirona but accretive in 2018, any sense in the level of accretion in 2018 and beyond if \u2013 not specific in terms of EPS just maybe some more detailed thoughts there?", ["Great. Thanks, guys, and good morning. I'll try to keep it to two real tight ones. Steven, the first one, on the tax rate of 27%, I believe that gives you roughly an extra $0.10 for the year but not moving the guidance."]], [" First, could you level set everyone on your FIFO accounting and how the price increases flow through P&L?", ["Thank you.

I guess maybe just on synergies and the execution there, clearly, things seem to be going well with the expectation now for $400 million, Eva if I heard you correctly, versus the previous communication of $300 million to $350 million. It sounds like the $800 million is still intact for next year.

Is that private label brands? Is that national brands like what you saw at Levi's? And what exactly are you doing in jewelry accessories that's driving that growth there?", ["Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. And congrats Michael and best wishes to both Cathy and Mark. Brian, you talked about apparel for a little bit, but I wanted to dive more into it. Because greater than 10% growth in your apparel business probably means you grew in absolute dollars more than anybody in the entire United States apparel industry. So -- and even if that's not the case, it's an acceleration from 5% last quarter."]], [" So, again, I just wanted to get a sense of, are you still sort of thinking that? You know, that's kind of $18-ish-million in 2018, and then, another 100 basis points of growth in 2019?", [" Not so much for NeoTract and Vascular.

Hey good afternoon guys. A couple of questions. First, I just want to make sure I've got the baseline cost estimate to complete the plant sort of right as I know \u2013 I'm sure people are trying to benchmark that against the $18 billion cost that SCANA articulated in their decision not to move forward.

My follow-up is for Pat. And, Pat, obviously the slide on Permian asset sales, just to be clear, I'm not entirely sure if you were indicating that those would be outright disposals or swaps because even at the low end of your valuation, the $20,000 an acre, that could be a $3.5 billion type number."]], [" There\u2019s still healthy liquidity and capital chasing multi-family product, but what kind of depths in buyer pools have you seen?", [" You mentioned cap rates are broadly unchanged."]], [" I'm wondering as you think about going forward in \u2013 should we think about kind of a $350 million plus number as opposed to a $300 million plus number or there are offsets or is that the right way to think about it?", ["Yeah. That's very helpful. And then just one more, at the Analyst Day, I think you talked about footprint opportunities as being separate from the core $300 million plus synergy number.

Thanks for taking my question. So maybe, Mike, now I want to start off on the last question on the back half guidance, right, the acceleration implied by the guidance."]], [" And then the second part, you gave us an $8 million amortization number, but you didn\u2019t tell us whether that was like quarterly or how does that flow through?", ["So, there\u2019s two pieces here. One on the \u2013 you gave us an adjusted gross margin of 51.8%, which pulled out all the noise. So, that\u2019s still down year-over-year and yet retention\u2019s better.

And my second question is for Scott also, which is -- you gave a lot of color on cadence; curious on the first half versus back half, how much of that is gross margin versus SG&A? Is gross margin -- as we continue to scale over salon investments, is that the sort of pressure point in gross margin and would you expect that down in the first half?", [" I mean, it's in more stores; Kylie had a smaller assortment, it was 18 SKUs or something like that and it sold out."]], [" Can you quantify and provide more color on what's going on there and then how did that line in the model track next year, would that be expected to step down materially in 2018?", ["Actually, just, first, had a quick follow-up on that prior question on price. I know last quarter you had talked about these pricing experiments switching price a little harder and then adjusting the volume impact. I'm just curious if that continued this quarter and then my question though was really on the core growth outlook, I mean last quarter you raised 50 bps that added $0.10 to EPS, I must say it was a little anti-climatic to see 150 basis points rise this quarter largely offset by this other net."]], [" But it would also include delivery costs to achieve the revenue synergies that you outlined when you did the deal, which would be some portion of that 180 to 200 and maybe if you can \u2013 Eric, if you can talk about how you're looking at those delivery costs for 2019 and then the trajectory of expenses going into 2020, given that we're potentially guiding down on expenses and saves as the year?", ["Maybe I'll just start with expenses and then move on to revenue growth question.

Thank you for that, Keith. And I guess just also apologies to maybe beat a dead horse here, but I just want to make sure I am thinking about it right on Kichler with the accretion.

I just wanted to clarify something in terms of backing into your EBIT margin guidance. So if I look at fiscal '17, excluding the extra week, I get kind of an 8.8% EBIT. And then, if I look at your guidance range for fiscal '18, excluding the $100 million investment, I kind of get 8.9% to 9.3% of margin range."]], [" And so, I guess the question is have you kept up with the volume with land, and if not, what have you done to maintain the efficiencies in the yards as utilization rate seemingly creeps up?", [" I know you've reported lots of land acquisitions, but you haven't given us a sense of how much you picked up."]], [" I guess first on the utility market, just when you're talking about the high single-digit growth outlook for the year, can you help parse sort of what your view is on the underlying market growth and then how much you would attribute to company-specific factors, namely share gains?", ["Good morning. Good morning. A couple of things from my end."]], [" So I guess the question is, are you letting the dog off the leash a little bit on sales pace or is that really more a function of mix?", ["Okay, thanks for that. And I think in your opening comments Ryan you said sales were running maybe up 15% year-over-year in the first two months and then you hit the headwind from the storms and in September you did have a pace of growth although modest but it seems like it would have been higher had the storms not occurred."]], [" I guess, what gives you the confidence that you will be able to execute on kind of that $800 million for the year?", ["Good morning guys. So Conor, just on the transaction market again."]], [" So first question is, do you think that fundamentals for these products in terms of consolidation in the bar market tariffs is everything you're seeing on the demand side would that suggest you think margins would stay elevated relative to where you were this year?", ["Two questions not relating to the flat-rolled market which tends to get all the press. But firstly, when you look at your long products portfolio, you seemed pretty significant change in metal spread across most of all your line product categories as well as plate. So I just did some quick numbers looking at 1Q'18 versus 4Q'18 and it's at $1.6 billion of incremental EBITDA run rate just on metal spread change."]], [" Or is there any sense that these reviews may take a little bit longer than you're previously estimating?", ["So one, if you can maybe just provide a little more detail on that other income and expense line. I believe you mentioned is they provide $2 billion to $3 billion of income for the year. That's a little bit more than what we were estimating. So just a little more color on what you're already incorporating in there at the start of the year. And then again, maybe a little bit of sense of the quarterly breakdown would be very helpful given it's a fairly large number. And then on the Pharma side, just one question. You mentioned esketamine or erdafitinib that are both in front of the FDA. I know they both had breakthrough designation. I'm just wondering if you've seen any impact given the government shutdown on your interactions with the FDA over the past month."]], [" What changed here, and really interested in Glen, getting your thoughts on you know, how -- what's your read on this? Do you view how this premium revenue bucket has a good read across for corporate spend?", ["Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First question for Glen; now that you 're breaking up a premium product versus main cabin, now I did notice that growth in premium revenues did decelerate a little bit to up 10 in 4Q versus, I think, you're tracking like a mid-teens rate earlier in the year."]], [" Can you talk about the pushes and pulls on balance sheet growth, average earning assets were down quarter-over-quarter for the first time in many years and I guess that balance sheet size the product of deposit growth in the opportunities that growing loans, but you remain out of cash into loans and securities also shrinking the balance sheet this quarter and I am wondering if this is \u2013 if this will be more indicative of your future plans and lower deposit, lower growth quarter as you focus on profitability over volume?", ["Hi, this is Amanda Larsen on for Ken."]], [" Can you talk about kind of how far in terms of the revenue growth we're seeing, how that breaks out between production and sustainment? Kind of how far ahead we are based on going from 91 deliveries this year to 130?", ["I wanted to ask a multiple-part question on F-35. It looks like F-35 in the quarter grew fairly significantly well above kind of the delivery rate growth."]], [" So I guess tell us how quickly can you get the Breast Health team trained in on the product line?", ["Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats to both Bob as well as Karleen. Let's see, staying at Faxitron for a second, if I may. I guess just a couple of follow-up questions off of Isaac's."]], [" And what do you think the drivers are there?", ["Understand. And thanks for that answer. And just maybe a follow-up for Mike Coyle just thinking about the CVG performance in the quarter, maybe you can help us understand what went better than expected minus 4% was the guidance you guys hit 5% organic growth. And maybe also just touch on your performance in TAVR specifically and your outperformance of the market."]], [" So I mean just broadly speaking, what do you think it's going to take to get factor based investing to become a stronger flow category broadly?", ["Okay, great. And then Marty, just maybe a broader question, just on factory based investing broadly. Obviously, there is a lot of compelling components of that, but more recently, we have seen a lot of the ETF flows really be abated now. I think it's about -- and once it's [indiscernible], it's about 20% of the ETF industry and you only captured about 10% of ETF growth in 2017 in January, according to our measures, more like just 1%."]], [" Is that a fair way to think about it? And is it a linear, I guess, progression at $55 and $3 from 2020 to 2026 as we think about free cash flow?", ["Thanks. Just following on some of the questions around the long-term outlook, I guess if I'm thinking about the 2018 program, you've said that you'll provide some free cash flow at the current strip. So if I run sensitivities off that and look at the breakeven you're talking about in 2020 seems to imply couple hundred million dollars of free cash flow, but by 2026, given some prior comments around rigs, potentially upwards of a couple billion dollars a year of free cash flow given a low 60s type rig count in 2026."]], [" So, could you just give us some sense on sort of the magnitude of these investments and the overall magnitude of gross margin improvement like as 50 basis points or 100 basis points in 2019?", ["Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Tony, can you address sort of the overall gross margins in 2019, pretty easy compares from Q1 of last year when you are ramping your Gen 10, but you\u2019re talking about only a marginal uplift here in Q1 of this year and you noted some investments."]], [" So, if there is anything that you can call out what maybe depressed that? And then maybe longer term you talked about within Pershing in the RIA strategy, maybe what are your expectations of potentially picking up market share given the industry consolidation that\u2019s upon us here?", ["Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then on clearing, just on the actual clearing service fees of $421 million, just given the way the markets have moved in DARTS and the online brokerage industry at least have been pretty strong. If you want to just \u2013 I would have expected that line to be a little bit stronger in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis."]], [" So I want to talk a little bit about that shift that I think is kind of at that inflection point?", [" And then you mentioned ongoing productivity also contributing in fiscal 2020. So if you could talk about areas where that work is coming through because I think for retail all the points that you've just made around investing in new channels and new markets there's also the other side of that equation which is reaching a point where you can kind of take resources away from some of the slower or no growth areas of the business."]], [" Why has that proven such a \u2013 and I know you're at the mercy of the payers, but why isn't there been more vertical traction with some of these risk-sharing things?", ["Okay. I mean, I guess from my perspective, it's surprising that 2018, 2019, we're not further along with you guys having executed some \u2013 let's take care of your 10,000 dialysis patients in these four states for x dollars a patient, we will be on the hook for the quality and the outcomes, you pay us one number."]], [" And then, just as a follow up on the free cash flow situation for the quarter, for Brian, is that $500 million trade working capital opportunity?", ["Got it."]], [" Clearly FirstNet is having a positive impact, but how should we think about on a going forward basis through 2019 the appetite for that trade-off between promotional activity margin and phone net adds?", ["Hi, guys. Thanks. Maybe just a quick comment on the wireless business. It sounds like you guys grew -- you are fairly aggressive in 1Q on the buy one get one offers."]], [" And then as other clarifying question, you said in the SAPIEN 3 low-risk CAP, even if you maxed out that CAP this year and add 1% to growth, were you referring to just TAVR growth or overall company growth?", ["Two quick clarifying questions, and have a quick one on CENTERA. So first, Mike, outside the United States, you talked about growing below the markets, so that's share lost to your largest competitor, that's Medtronic. But if you added Abbott and Boston, they're starting to trend in that $100 million range, I'm wondering if you're seeing any share lost to Abbott or Boston Scientific in Europe."]], [" So I was just curious do you think there\u2019s that same type of opportunity as a multiplier, if you will, over time for the online ecosystem?", ["Thanks so much. And Brad, it\u2019s been a real pleasure over last 10 years or so, but I look forward to working more closely with Sasan, going forward. Maybe I can start Brad, just as you think about tax for next year, two things struck me. One was your guidance range, was actually for consumer was narrower than normal. And I would have thought that given the moving pieces in next year's season, you may have actually gone to the other way. So would love just to get your sense of how you are thinking about the different inputs into that. And then second just on -- as we think about ancillary revenues on Small Business online ecosystem. There\u2019s a big gap obviously relative to QBO revenue today. And if you compared it to the desktop business, I think ancillary actually got up to almost 2x, QuickBooks Desktop revenue."]], [" So, from a geographic standpoint, are we to just interpret that?", ["That's helpful. Thanks, Bob. And I guess just then going back to the gross margin for a moment, I did find it encouraging that you kind of said it was more limited to a few communities and a couple of markets in the Southeast at higher price points."]], [" So should we assume more flattish levels of SG&A rate as we move through the balance of the year and specific to 1Q are there enough \u2013 or gross margin tailwinds to more than offset that aforementioned 1Q SG&A headwind?", ["Good morning. Regarding SG&A overall you highlighted I believe 20 basis points of deleverage in 1Q and you called out occupancy and still needing to lap the store manager compensation increase from last year as the factors driving that."]], [" Could you just size that up between Showtime and All Access?", ["Yes. Hey, guys. Les, couple for you. Thanks for the breakout or actually thanks for the aggregate sub number on the OTT product\u2019s 5 million subs."]], [" So why isn\u2019t Frutarom earning, I don\u2019t know, $45 million if you\u2019ve lowered your cost structure by that much? Why is the number so low?", ["In your remarks, you said that you knocked out $20 million in costs in Frutarom. But the year-over-year increase in operating income is about $5 million. And even if you compare it to the first quarter of 2019, maybe you\u2019re $3 million up."]], ["0 next year; could you comment on the relative book-to-bill between foreign and domestic, both this year and kind of the trends going into next year?", ["So you've raised your bookings target by $1 billion for this year and look for book-to-bill over 1."]], [" Can you discuss some of the opportunities there and maybe some of the share gain potential you have as that segment of the market makes a pretty sizable transition?", ["Thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter. Gary, in your prepared remark, you talked about some of that share gains you've generated over the past few years, particularly in patterning and e-beam inspection. A lot of it is due to the industry transition to 3D NAND and your ability to introduce some of the new products for that product. At the same time, we're seeing now the industry transition on the logic side to 10 and 7 nanometers."]], [" Is that driven more by investments in the business relative to tax savings? Or is that more kind of the underlying profitability of the PNC business?", ["Thank you. First, on the outlook for the underlying combined ratio in 2018 of 86% to 88%. Clearly, a little higher than 85.6% in 2017. If I look at the midpoint, that would imply I think around $500 million of less underlying profit."]], [" But can you just give us an update kind of where you\u2019re at?", ["Okay. That\u2019s great. And then maybe, Bill, just a quick follow-up on Project XL. Appreciate the disclosure of the 10 \u2013 I think it was $10 million or $11 million from that one initiative on the used sales."]], [" Within the 15% sales growth forecast that you have for the Ag business at Deere, what assumptions do you have for small and medium-duty Ag versus the large Ag?", ["Thanks. Good morning."]], [" But if I think specifically about your station subscribers which are traditional MVPDs and the virtual MVPDs, with the launch of some of the new MVPDs over the last quarter or two, have you seen an improvement in that trend as a stand-alone? What are you seeing there at this point?", ["Okay. Thanks on that. And then, Les, you did mention the subscribers growing across your business which is healthy."]], [" And I understand roastery and Reserve is sort of a way of targeting that, but how do you think about the role competition is now playing in your sales trajectory today versus a year ago, let's say? Is that a contributing factor in your minds? And how would you close on that?", ["Thanks very much. You talk a lot about retail environment and that's presumably the implication it's a headwind to your sales. But competition doesn't come up much on Starbucks calls. There is more and better places to get coffee today than there ever has been."]], [" How are you?", ["Great, thanks good morning."]], [" With regional flying garnering nearly double the PRASM of mainline, shouldn\u2019t this have a positive mix effect on your RASM? I\u2019m thinking about this the right way? And if so, can you provide any color on what you think a potential tailwind from more of this line could be?", ["Hi. Good morning, everyone. I guess, Scott or Andrew, staying on this theme of RASM, margin accretion from this new hub-spoke flying. I guess, when I do look at your domestic schedules, obviously regional ASM\u2019s are up around 10% this year versus down last year, mainline not drastically different."]], [" Is that the right way to think about it on the way you\u2019d run the business before any other adjustments?", ["Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then switching gears to Clark and I\u2019ll come back into the queue. I just want to be clear on the comment you shared with us, Eddie. So there is a \u2013 in the 8-K there\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m rounding there is approximately $9 million of reported income by Clark and you\u2019re suggesting that you have $11 million that you can add back to that because of underlying, it was vehicles and \u2013 forgetting the other item, you pulled out here, as I\u2019m looking through my notes, vehicles and rents were $8 million of that, but there is $11 million. So I\u2019m looking at $20 million as a starting number."]], [" Can you just talk about how, number one, the outlook for larger orders appears to be developing for the second half of the year? And number two, what you're expecting for relative growth between EVM and AIT for the second half of the year?", ["Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. The first question is just on the guidance and what it implies for the second half of the year. I just want to make sure that I'm understanding this correctly. So the guidance for 5% to 8% revenue growth for the year, if you hit the midpoint in the second quarter, the growth in the first half will be about 8.5% and the guidance implies then about 4.5% in the second half including a net tailwind from FX and acquisitions."]], [" But what about unhedged and maybe as a follow-up to that going forward, since this strip is pretty flat at 51% for hedging purposes, where do you feel comfortable for 2021 and 2022 coverage?", [" You\u2019ve got a really strong hedge book program this year that puts a lot of protection. And on the downside, it also makes the breakeven pretty low, at five below $50 WTI."]], [" Couple of questions, first, can you comment on the sustainability broadly of your returns in your markets and banking businesses, 15% return on allocated equity and markets, 18% banking despite the fact that you increased your capital allocation there?", ["Hi. Good morning and congratulations on the results and on the progress."]], [" The question is, is there some upward trend however for any customers beyond that, in other words that was a snapshot, but have you seen any customers in fact increasing from perhaps low single-digit to mid-single digit on their way to high single digit perhaps, just as for example in the case of Synopsys, Intel has grown from 10% or 11% of their business to 16%, 17% of Synopsis, is there some similar trend for any customers in your case?", ["Okay, I have just two more questions, I\u2019ll ask them at the same time. For John, on the last conference call, a quarter ago, we talked a bit about customer concentration and you mentioned that you have no customers at more than a single digit percentage of revenue."]], [" And I guess can you help me understand what the components of that are that are maybe just transitory?", ["Hey, thanks. So I guess the question I have and I know you try to encourage us not to look at your business in terms of the core and fuel and alternative profits, but you did kind of give us the slide at the Analyst Day with that depicted so it's hard not to look at your business this way, but when I look at the full year 2018 and I try to break out what the core business actually did, the decline was fairly significant, like I'm kind of backing into almost 30% decline in the quarter."]], [" And I know you feel like it is building, but which initiatives give you the confidence that that is going to be the case heading into fiscal 2019?", ["Thanks. Good evening. Question on just the priorities of the initiatives you've been talking about. I can tell that after this call, there's going to be an argument about the momentum that you laid out some sales targets over the next couple quarters that suggest and even mentioned in recent months that the momentum is building."]], [" What's wrong with that logic?", [" I mean, Q1 seems to be very transitory in nature, and we should see a meaningful improvement in your business in the back half of '18, and really going into '19 given the later cycle and the lagging part -- the buying phase that you insisted."]], [" Does that still hold true just given the increased mix to ratable or any other factors?", ["Okay. Great. Just one quick follow-up for Nick.

A couple of more programming questions. My first one is about the programming asset that you have been investing in and building and you talk about the ways to monetize it."]], [" Not that you're preparing for this but could you remind us how quickly and, to what degree, could you reduce CapEx if you needed to if there was something on the horizon that we're not all seeing yet and why and what issues you may have in securing the dividend through the cycle?", ["And then, my other question to the dividend and recognizing your commentary today suggest you're comfortable in your outlook and the momentum into 2019 and, yeah, the stock is up today. But when the stock is at $40 a share, the dividend yield is 5% and that is typically a level where people are really beginning to worry about the macro outlook going forward."]], [" And then just I would be curious I know it\u2019s hard to say explicitly on a call like this, but from your perspective on the management side, do you think there is a need for augmentation or more changes and I would be interested to get your sense on the Anthem team working together, historically it\u2019s been geographically diverse management team, I am curious if there is thoughts to get people closer together?", ["Hi. Thanks. Good morning. And I will Echo the comments, welcome to the new role Gail as well. I wanted to ask just first on the Medicare advantage acquisitions just looking at the cash flow statement it looks like you did about $2 billion for HealthSun maybe there is some other true up type of stuff in there, but obviously that screens as a big number for 40,000 lives, so could you talk a little about more of the capabilities, I assume there is some provider business in their, etcetera."]], [" Is it still a reduction of net debt first and foremost?", ["Okay. And then, secondly, again a lot of moving parts, but it's kind of a 20% reduction in CapEx, you should have better working capital improvement for this year. Net income should be up as well. So, at least from my numbers, I'm getting to kind of a free cash flow yield, assuming a $24 stock price of kind of 7% to 8%, which is getting pretty sporty. And I'm just curious with regards to priorities of the deployment of that surplus cash flow."]], [" And so -- but just wondering, is the goal to drive consumer engagement with those newer listings primarily on Vrbo?", [" I'm just trying to get a sense for how much of the strength is sort of year two or that as opposed to better stability in the macro environment. And then my other question is just in terms of Vrbo and the investments there. I know that you're trying to compete in urban and international and growing supply in urban and international."]], [" I just wanted to see if you think that is feasible, and then around that and around CBRS, what interest are you seeing beyond the Big Four carriers in terms of looking at potentially deploying that?", [" If you take the C-band alliance proposals of the last few days, they're now looking to free-up 100 megahertz within 18 months of report in order.

Just one quick clarification on the U.S. traffic, I know you mentioned it was negative, but I was wondering if it was negative if you adjust for that leap day drag.

I will answer the first one on supply. The way both this year and in prior years and in future years we see the growth being met, knowing that growth is largely EV growth and increasingly for higher quality batteries, hydroxide, hy- nickelate based chemistries. It's coming from, what we call, the integrated majors. There's about five of us. Luke referenced their names earlier, ourselves, Livent, SQM and in China, Ganfeng and Tianqi. These companies benefit not only from an integrated resource in most cases, but also secondarily from a processing know-how over time in terms of how to tune their conversion assets to their specific resources. And then finally, they have the financial capabilities to fund whatever significant capital expansions required to meet and use markets. So these are the companies that are meeting that demand.

You've re-upped the buyback, but it's been pretty steady in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion annual range.

I\u2019m curious - specifically on raw materials, I get what you\u2019re saying; on the other hand, Nick, didn\u2019t you say that tariffs would be fully offset, and versus November, this raw material productivity, the minus-$0.20 to minus-$0.10, is that actually lower, because obviously things like oil and other things have actually declined, so just trying to calibrate why, even though you lowered the guide where only the midpoint is $0."]], ["com?", ["Thank you.

You have spent about the same percentage on SG&A the last two years, and you plan to spend similarly this year. You are growing your R&D and you are also growing your top line and your gross margin line.

And then lastly, just clarifying your comments (43:32) so you laid out your 2020-2022 CapEx plan which equate to a 5.4% CAGR on rate base, per your math.

Does that help? Does that make sense?", [" So now it's two years, 140 basis points lower according to your own numbers, right, the track on track, according to your own numbers. And again, this quarter, for all mission, looks like you're not gaining in Brazil and Russia and India and U.K., and France and China at least, and a lot of that to local competitors. So I guess, I'm struggling for confidence, as you can tell by the question, I'm struggling for confidence that things are getting better quickly here. And I guess, the easier comps and FX should help, but I just don't see signs of Colgate doing better underlyingly."]], [" Could you just kind of remind us the scale of your participation and why you don't think these types of earnings would continue going forward?", ["Yeah.

And then just can I clarify one other thing. I think if I heard you right, you said at various point that you thought that the tax reform will ultimately be accretive to the long-term plan and I think you said that you have about 4%, you anticipate having about 4% headroom and that each percentage point would give you capacity for another $400 million of investment.

And bigger picture, I guess, question for multiple members of the team, we're entering positions to transfer gasoline, I think, nationwide now versus where we started at the beginning of the year. I think that the mentality has changed 180 degrees. And looking forward to IMO 2020, where you think about maybe some benefits there as well.

On OptumInsight, backlog grew nicely, I think previously the target there had been in the $15 billion to $16 billion range to end the year you will need a pretty strong fourth quarter to get there.

A couple of questions, please. Firstly on the regional margin development. I wonder if you could help me understand a little bit better the regional margin development in the Americas to start with. I understand, there is a lot going on within that.

And then on the Argus -- or financial services organic outlook, I think there was a moment at the Investor Day where there's a question about should 2018 be an outsized growth year.

So the capital management your CET1 target of 10%, I believe you said you\u2019re -- that, that's the higher now than the 9.5% to 10% because of the potential for sustained faster loan growth.

And then just a quick follow-up in terms of keeping the product pipeline healthy, can you just give us an update on the multi-column e-beam EUV reticle inspection platform, is that still on track for introduction next year?", ["Yes, thanks for the follow-up."]], [" So I guess just curious, if you only expect fees to be flat to up 1% in 2Q with the markets rebounding so strong and the net interest income flat for the year, maybe what backdrop would you become maybe more aggressive on reducing the cost base?", ["Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Eric, just a follow-up on the expenses. You reiterated the 1% lower for the year, but you also mentioned the influx bull with the backdrop."]], [" Given seemingly strong end market conditions and a lot of the momentum you've had for a little while now, is this just beginning of the year conservatism? Or is this just kind of what you'd expect in terms of a trend towards normalizing towards the mean after a couple of really strong years? And then I guess, just to layer in one more element to the question, and I apologize if I've missed this in your prepared remarks, but could you just share what your assumptions for growth are in terms of what you built into 2020 revenue growth guidance by end market and geography?", ["Okay, thank you for that. And it's a good segue to the second thing I wanted to unpack a little bit more, which is indeed guidance. So your first \u2013 your initial organic revenue growth target of 5% for the year is on the lower end of your long-term 5% to 7% target that you outlined at the Analyst Day over the summer."]], [" Of that, what was broken out in the non-GAAP adjustment schedule in the press release?", ["I just wanted to go back and follow-up on the G&A, or I am sorry, overall operating income and the one-time expenses. And happy to do this offline if that\u2019s easier. But I think you mentioned that there\u2019s about $20 million in non-recurring in the quarter."]], [" The combined ratio guidance is not only including Navigator acquisition, Navigator historically having higher combined ratio than Hartford's, so I just wonder would that be dilutive to your like your combined ratio going forward? And what's your plan in that $200 million earnings targeting four to five years included some improvements in underwriting in Navigator?", ["Thank you, and first -- highlight Chinese New Year today. My first question is on your guidance."]], [" I just love a little bit more context about what you might feel that the top success factors in that path, whether it\u2019s key launch like Gatorade Zero better realize price mix as inflation builds more of an inflection in core Pepsi or just are there one or two priorities on your scorecard that you could call out for us that will be great?", ["Hey, good morning. Thanks. So going back to North America Beverages for a minute, it does indeed look like we are on track for a return to growth in the second half, which is great."]], [" And so I guess, what I wanted to ask is, whether you believe this April guided quarter hit the bottom on that trend? And if you don\u2019t believe that, why not? And if you do believe it, why do you believe it\u2019s the bottom?", ["Well, it\u2019s a miracle. Okay, thanks for the chance again. I wanted to zero in on the year-over-year growth rate on the revenue. I just \u2013 I\u2019m looking at the trend here back in April of 2018, it was 11% and 11.6% then 7.2%, then 1.6% in January, and then you\u2019re guiding for basically flat, maybe down just $1 million or $2 million."]], [" Thank you, Scott, I think, could you just help us bridge, I guess, the -- or understand the components a little bit better of the 2020 free cash flow guidance?", ["Morgan."]], [" So, is this an investment year in your view or just kind of more of the steady kind of increase?", [" And then as you look forward, you mentioned that headcount is going to accelerate in 2020."]], [" Can you perhaps just talk about that and give us a sense for why QCT margins are falling sequentially at 18% midpoint for December quarter?", ["And maybe just a quick follow-up for George. In the QTL business, you booked $95 million of additional revenue in non-GAAP for QTL for licensing that wasn't in GAAP sales."]], [" Where do you see that settling out? With this emphasis, does that become half? Does it become the majority over time? What's the goal that you and your teams have for that?", ["Just had a few I wanted to get a sense on. Glenn, I know we've spent a lot of time talking about brand marketing. But if we look at the first half, brand is still only about 1/10 of what you're spending on, on customer acquisition."]], [" But can you talk a little bit about the Chilean export price dynamic and how that might impact Q2 lithium EBITDA specifically?", ["Hi. This is Robin, on for Joel. Thanks for taking my questions. So my first is, so we have seen publicly available export data out of Chile. It's showing sequential carbonate price reductions in the past couple of months. I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there is some carbonate price weakness from spodumene supply pressures."]], [" I'm imagining you're trying to tie that to Ray Ritchey's 50th birthday, but why so long?", [" And then my second question is, Marriott doesn't stabilize until 2022."]], [" Is that kind of broadly true? Are there lines of business or geographies where you actually don\u2019t see that to be the case?", ["Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Dom, from your earlier comments, it sounds like between the underwriting actions that you\u2019ve taken and has been implemented starting in January and the rate increases that you\u2019ve been seeing, you are expecting an overall improvement. So basically, you are expecting that rates will be an excess of loss trends."]], [" Are there things that maybe efficiencies had the wrong outcome, like maybe hubbing was detrimental in some way? I\u2019m just wondering in that, if it\u2019s purely coincidental, or as you look back at some of the areas where you\u2019ve tapped into savings over the last 5 or 6 years, if there\u2019s been sort of unintended repercussions from a growth standpoint?", ["Just reflecting on the fact that I think it\u2019s been around six years since you introduced Global Growth and Efficiency Program. And that -- one thing that I thought about that program was sort of expanding your productivity efforts pretty demonstrably beyond gross margin and into more SG&A. And so, over these ensuing six years, I know there\u2019s been macro dynamics, but top-line growth has also slowed, even as you were embarking on this broader productivity path. So, just thinking back on some of the savings that you\u2019ve been able to generate, the areas that you focused on."]], [" So, like North America obviously, non-recur of the Explorer launch issues and UAW bonus, which are collectively pretty big, is that offset by the - completely offset by the F-Series launch and other items?", ["Great, thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you might be able to give us a little bit more color on your regional auto EBIT expectations for 2020. It seems like you would have a few pretty significant tailwinds set up, which don't really appear to be flowing into your 2020 EBIT guidance for Auto, which you said was up normally - nominally. I guess, essentially, I'm hoping that you can talk a little bit about the direction that you are expecting for each of the key markets."]], [" You guys certainly called out the timing of Easter, but just want to make sure anything else at play there, the step down from 17% to 12%, were there any markets in Europe that may have pulled back a little bit, maybe if you can just \u2013 can provide some overall color across the international landscape specific to CAG recurring?", ["Great. Thanks, guys and good morning. Maybe two. The first one just your thoughts on international CAG recurring traction. I think it was plus 17% in the first quarter, still a robust 12%, but slowed to 12% in 2Q."]], [" So what's the outlook on those two numbers as well, if I could?", [" And then also on interest expense you had assumed that would be down, I know that you've got some August notes you're going to reissue. But it also seems like you issued more debt in the quarter than I expected."]], [" Does that mean zero capacity additions, does that mean capacity reduction? So where are we in terms of capacity being added in the market at this run rate?", ["Hi, thanks for taking my question. So, Dan, I understand you don't want to call the bottom, but I see like your semiconductor what you anticipate for next quarter to be kind of flattish sequentially. And my question is really, if you get the run rate of this quarter like the \u2013 the money that your clients spent with you in DRAMs, so that's about $400 million, $500 million in NAND, that kind of run rate, what's happening in the market, what's happening in the installed base."]], [" Would you guys potentially elect to ratchet up that budget?", ["Hey, guys. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the comments around the CapEx budget. You guys talked about sort of a conservative price deck of $55 to $60 for 2019. I'm assuming that's WTI-Cushing price. And you obviously have the range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. I just wanted to get a sense of how you guys might proceed if we did see further upside in the oil price or maybe we average something closer to the, I mean, 60s to 70s."]], [" So as we think about these two factors, it would be very helpful for us if you can help us just to understand which one has a greater impact on guidance? So, how would you rank branded inflation impact on your forecast versus generic inflation?", ["So, one follow-up there. When we think about genetic deflation to your point kind of like stable to negative 7% to negative 9%, in guidance you highlight to us always brand inflation and then generic deflation."]], [" Can you just talk about exactly or give a little bit more color, you touched on it, but more about what you're investing in and what kind of return you expect from the investment and where we should see it?", ["Barry, just want to follow-up on SG&A. SG&A dollars in the quarter, maybe a little bit higher than was expected going back to the guidance in February. And then I think that, for 2Q, you're calling out a forward acceleration within the year from the second half, approximately $5 million of growth related investments. I'm assuming that's SG&A."]], [" But the last 3 to 6 months, maybe talk us through how you see the next one or two big factors that you're really focused on ensuring that Waymo becomes what it could be?", ["Thanks for taking mu questions. I have two. Just the first one to go back to YouTube in a very strong quarter. It sounds like on branded advertising and now some of these new direct response ads. I was curious, Sundar, as you think about with an innovation focus, what do you see as being one or two of the biggest opportunities to further improve the quality or the efficacy of the ad product, you provide for advertisers on YouTube from here. And then Waymo, got a couple of milestones."]], ["08 increases is sustainable even under No-go, is that a correct statement?", ["Okay. And I think I understood that the 5% growth rate on EPS assumes that a Vogtle Go decision is made. It's unclear \u2013 I guess, you weren't really quite sure how much it might get reduced in a No-go situation, but I think if I heard you right, you did reiterate a dividend growth of 8% increases or $0."]], [" So, take us through what that opportunity is?", ["This is all good to hear. And for my follow-up I just wanted to follow-up on Nathan's last question there on these new smart infrastructure platforms. So we've heard all about non-revenue water. We understand how Pure fits in with Visenti and what's been done in Singapore and what the opportunities are. We've heard a bit, you've been cagey Patrick about the water shed opportunities but I've heard from customers. I know which customers are doing the pilot programs the feedback has been very good so we're excited about that. So maybe a bit more on the combined storm overflow, I know it's a pain and coming to this or not I was here in South Bend or excuse me I was in Austin for the big water conference. And I sat in the presentation from the South Bend Municipality and they talked about Emnet. And they gave -- they showed the dashboard, was pretty compelling and now turns now it's part of Xylem."]], [" Could you give us an update as to where you were, where you are now on that journey that you saw then in terms of your own COGS realization and then talk about how Pinnacle really changes that and maybe perhaps adds to that? And then relatedly, how do you view your capital expenditure needs for the combined company over the next few years?", ["Thanks. Good morning. Looking back a couple of years now to that Analyst Day, you laid out some long-term supply chain opportunities, including network consolidation and ingredient sourcing."]], [" Can you help us understand maybe just what that number looks like? If we try to normalize it for renewals and an extra month of duration, I mean, would it be 40%? If we just try to uncover the new ACV bookings growth, and if you can't do that is there just any other way to try to convey the acceleration that you mentioned in new business growth?", ["Yes. Thank you. So Marc, you described it as perhaps our best quarter ever. And Keith, you said execution was as strong as you've seen in your career, and it's a long, decorated career obviously. The number that is mind-bending is the 48% growth in the unbilled deferred revenue. And so I think that was growing in the 20%s ex-Demandware."]], [" So I wanted to ask you in two cents, how do you bill?", ["A little bit different take on capital. Talked a lot about share repurchase. But your dividend, you're guiding towards higher payout ratios, you had about 27% kind of ending this year. You're saying that next year is going to be 30%, 35% and then your medium term is 35% to 40%. One of the things that we did when we were managing a bank where we didn't think we're getting the valuation we wanted was the dividend is actually a better way to kind of show the strength of a growing franchise. If you're growing, the dividend really reflects the ability to be able to show the value of that income stream that you're creating."]], [" Could you help us understand your expectation of relative contribution from these initiatives in fiscal 2019? And how that may evolve once we get past next year given the timing of the broader new product rollout?", ["Thank you. Good morning. So you laid out three broad drivers of growth at the Investor Day. I think it was sales head count, sales productivity and new products."]], [" So, can you just help us and give us more detail on what were these items in 2017? And were they included in guidance before or were they incorporated into kind of like the updated outlook that you provided us last week?", ["Yeah, hi. Good morning. So, the first question is about the discrete items. George, in your prepared remarks I think you talked about company specific discrete items, which largely impacted fiscal 2017 and (30:46) headwinds in fiscal year 2018."]], [" Sundar, coming out of CES and the success you had with Google Home and the Google Assistant during the holiday period based on the blog post you guys put out, can you identify some of the key investments in either partnerships or hardware or capabilities that you\u2019re targeting over the next one to two years to make sure the momentum around Assistant is sustained?", ["Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe two, one for Sundar and one for Ruth."]], [" I'm looking at build rate in the industry level at least projected build plans for North America calling for a modest -- a small sequential step up from 4Q to 1Q and I'm curious how PACCAR fits into that in terms of within the context of that I think you said down 5% to 7% deliveries where North America fits in relative to Europe and some of the other markets?", ["Thank you. Good morning. Preston, maybe, the first one just on the guidance here for the first quarter."]], [" How do I know that this Mach-E has generated more attention and kind of interest than in recent memory of any kind of product?", ["So picture that Ford's in a position where it's got a portfolio of products for its customers, including a bigger extensive offering than the other guy.

We already know that the kind of volume we're going to have in car years usage by 2025 will be over 100 million car years of usage of data, so just let that sink in. And that's what, that's what the market sees right, in the future of the car industry, that there is this kind of opportunity for expansion and growth. But I haven't forecasted that in tonight's discussion. It's not, it's because we got to prove that we can get this done, and get it, get it to produce the kind of results that you're seeing there. But I think we're much further along in that journey than we were just two years ago when you and I first started talking about it."]], [" So I guess the question is if rates do continue \u2013 short rates do continue to come in, maybe even more than what you\u2019re expecting, how does the deposit beta outlook change?", [" Because \u2013 and I asked because if your guidance comes to fruition, I calculate that your deposit costs \u2013 interest-bearing deposit costs are going to be probably in the 80 basis point range, probably lower \u2013 obviously lower, all in. It just doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a lot of room for deposit costs to come down from these levels given the low jump-off point, and deposit costs are already low relative to short-term rates from a historical standpoint."]], [" So had a few questions, first, I guess given the low cap rate decided and challenge of putting capital to work for new acquisitions here in your core markets, what\u2019s your current view today or more recently with the Board on expanding the portfolio year to perhaps some vibrant secondary markets that offer higher returns that not too dissimilar from say a Denver maybe Austin, Portland and Salt Lake and then what type of yield IRR premium would you require to go into those markets versus say your more established core markets?", ["Hey, there."]], [" So I am just wondering at a high level in terms of your portfolio reshaping efforts, how close do you think you are to being at sort of an optimal portfolio mix? And are there any sort of particular segments of the market where you feel you are maybe under or overexposed, such that 5 years from now in a perfect world, are there any parts of the portfolio that might look probably meaningfully different than where we are today?", ["Good morning. This is actually Lubi filling in for Akshay. I just wanted to ask a bit of a big picture question. So you have obviously completed a number of acquisitions. You have done some divestitures over the last few years as part of your portfolio reshaping efforts and obviously you still have a fair amount of the tax loss carry-forward remaining to do more."]], [" So I'm wondering what's driving that favorable treatment into next year, maybe how does some of your tiering placements for next year compare to your lower-priced competitor? And Quentin, are you still comfortable with the$100 million to $125 million pricing headwind next year as you give up some price to move into pharmacy or of these big wins, maybe, push that expectation a little bit higher in trade-off for volume?", ["Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. I wanted to ask - I know Steve you said you're not going to say a lot on formulary status, but we've seen a few positive sizable payers for 2020 with regards to DexCom's placement."]], [" So why was not capacity part of that discussion of what you can control, and is that something you are looking towards in 2018, to maybe rethink it?", [" I don't run errands, I am not trying to say, I know better than you guys. But at a simplistic level, we see domestic revenue growing, let's call it 4% this year. You guys chose to grow your capacity, let's call it 5%.

And then I had just one quick follow up here."]], [" And then looking forward on free cash flow, you specifically mentioned the timing of cash synergy costs and \u2013 so you're expecting ongoing pressure on free cash flow in the fiscal 2019 and what level of free cash do you expect in relation to your original guidance of roughly $900 million to $1 billion in fiscal 2019?", ["HI, thanks. I was hoping you could walk through the drivers of free cash flow in fiscal 2018 and why it came in so far below your expectations. And I guess, maybe there was an issue with receivables and inventories, hoping you could expand on that."]], [" What\u2019s like the right bridge to think about on how to get there? Is that still going to be volume-driven or are there some cost actions that you see down the line or pricing actions that you see down the line a little bit longer term?", ["And then, just kind of continuing on the 2021, you reiterated the expectation for $2.80 or $3 of earnings. But, I think you guided to something like a 16.8% underlying margin, which obviously implies another 80 basis points improvement on top of this year."]], [" So could you just remind us of some of the drivers?", ["My question is about the guidance. So the guidance seems to imply, I guess, slightly better operating profit growth in the second half of the year. In the second quarter, it was up, and it was up for the first time in a very long time, which is nice to see, but it was down for the full first half on similar comps to what you're assuming for the second half."]], [" Do you see a point in the horizon we are driving your EPS aspirations mid single-digits underlying this year and I think you want to try and pick it up a little bit over the next few years? Do you see a few obvious levers of ways that you can stabilize the margin or maybe increase it if same-store sales, stays in about the range we have been seeing lately?", ["Hey, guys. Thanks for all the detail and thanks for taking my question. Obviously, you guys have been very happy for a long time with the contribution to your same-store sales from the traffic increases that you have been seeing. I guess, it\u2019s just natural to think about that as you guys get bigger and bigger within the marketplace. Is the traffic and the unit growth being such a big contributor, but obviously that\u2019s got a higher cost component. As you look forward through your business and you see the margin compression maybe on Marmaxx and the HomeGoods side over the last 1 year and 1.5 years."]], [" So I'm just wondering if you could share with us, now that you've reset the dividend to remain competitive as to how the growth rate with -- how do you think about that?", ["Yes, it does. My follow-up is maybe for Rich. And it is kind of a philosophical question, I guess, because tripling or stepping up the dividend the way that you've done really starts to address an issue, I guess, that oil industry has been challenged with, which is how to value your sector that you in particular and obviously the general E&P space almost to the point of thinking along the lines of a dividend discount model with the depths of the acreage that you have in inventory and so on. So my question really is in order to help the generals do something like that, you need to have an idea what your thoughts are on future dividends strategy, payout ratios, trajectory for how that growth might follow your underlying capacity for cash flow growth."]], [" Can you talk a little bit about the yield curve and kind of the cost of 10-nanometer? And I guess really importantly, if the long-term sort of upper range of your gross margin had been 60% to 65%, do you still think that that's the right sort of higher-end range as we go to the 10-nanometer node for CPUs, notwithstanding that some of the adjacencies are lower gross margin?", ["I know you would like us to focus a little bit more on op margin than gross margin, but I just want to go back to the gross margin line. As far as I can remember, with an in line revenue quarter for March, this is the most significant gross margin miss to Street estimates that I can remember for the company. And I know you've talked about 10-nanometer volumes being higher than you expected this year."]], [" over the last few years, do you think there might need to be a broader reset of price gaps at some point, particularly with the market share momentum we're seeing at private label?", [" And given we've seen the price gap move up versus private label in a lot of your key product categories in the U.S."]], [" And then just separately, on the $345 million of First Niagara loan marks, can you remind us how much will ultimately flow through net interest income versus flow through credit? And then on the outlook for purchase accounting accretion, following the $100 million you expect in the back half of this year, how should we think about the step-down in 2018 and 2019?", ["Okay."]], [" Can we break that down a little bit more a couple of different ways, how much of its coming from standalone Invesco platform? How much of its coming from the legacy Oppenheimer foot print?", ["Okay, thank you very much, from Citi Group. So thank you very much for taking the question this morning. So I'd like just to come back to the savings opportunity for a moment, I think you the highlight 475 million and Loren just gave a little bit more detail when you post your comment here."]], [" What are you kind of penciling in for operating cash flow at this point for the year?", ["Thanks. Then a two-part question for Nick. First on the destocking and anything you can share with us in terms of your expectations for the mix of that between the third quarter and the fourth quarter in terms of the $66 million to $76 million that's still left for the back half. And then secondly, you talked about you don't want to bring inventories down further in the year."]], [" So as you think about that low to mid-single-digit growth, what's your outlook on total price as a contributor? And how do you balance that right now when you are seeing the rising, I guess, raw material prices? Do you take comfort that more of your portfolio is Personal Care versus household?", ["I guess, Ian, I was just wondering if you could talk maybe about overall company price deflation. I think this is the first time in maybe 6 years that we actually saw prices in negative. And I know from time to time, the U.S. and Europe have been a little bit more of an investment market. But usually, you've had the offsets in other markets."]], [" So I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of is how much of that is them and you feeling like the new partnership is going to help you expand the pie? And how -- or how much of that is them just getting a larger share of that pie?", ["I actually wanted to follow up on Craig's question. I want to commend you on renewing Delta. I think most people will recognize it's a valuable partnership for both you and for them. And clearly, they were pretty happy with the outcome. They had mentioned a contribution from Amex by 2023 of $7 billion, up from $3.4 billion this year. And that implies, if you just kind of straight-line that over the period, about $5 billion in 2021 versus their prior disclosure of $4 billion."]], [" I\u2019m wondering what you think is sort of biologically happen to account for this steep dose exposure curve [indiscernible]?", ["Great, thanks for taking the question. I guess a follow-up and sort of second question from me. So first one is, you\u2019ve been talking about exposure and dose a lot. Could you just broadly comment on how many of these patients actually achieved all the factors that you were looking for and how easily you think that will be the case in clinical practice. And I guess, the related question to that is, dose exposure curve that you\u2019re sort of talking about Al. I mean, what were their characteristics that were different were the kinetics of the amyloid plaque reduction different in these subgroup of patients with the achievement of tau or amyloid reductions were they significantly different."]], [" So I guess off of which base should we be thinking about the two percentage point improvement?", ["Got it, that's helpful, thanks. And then a slightly bigger picture question to you guys on profitability. I guess when we take a step back, obviously, a very nice move on expenses this year, and you guys have more to do next year. I guess when you go back a year or so ago, you had a slide out talking about medium-term pretax targets kind of shooting for 2 percentage point improvement in pretax margin. That's still the case, but I'm curious what's the base and what total may be the destination here because in 2018, pretax margins were 28, 29. You guys are kind of 26-ish this year."]], [" And then also if you think this significant inventory build is contributing to the higher shrink accrual of 30 basis points?", ["Thanks. Kevin, I just wanted to confirm that I heard correctly the Family Dollar inventory was up 14% per square foot, that that's correct. It looks like the projected payback in revenue and gross profit dollars is minimal. I just wanted to see if you could explain that."]], [" Is that kind of what we should be thinking for '19 sort of mid to high single-digit growth for BIAF?", [" And then I think, Kevin, you also mentioned that the 8% growth you saw in FY18 was more representative of that business."]], [" So when does that come back?", ["I'd like to go back to actually both -- to pricing on both the group markets and voluntary. A few years ago, there were some companies that just weren't performing well and they seem to have cleaned it up and repriced. And performance, in general, in that state space in group seems to be pretty solid. But when we had the new tax legislation at the beginning of 2018, I think, across-the-board companies were saying they're going to have to give back some of that pricing to the consumers. And so on that front, I'm just wondering when that comes back because the benefit ratios look really good at Unum, particularly in your group disability line and at your competitors."]], [" And I'm just curious if you can talk about, like, what has been driving the outperformance, what level of visibility do you have?", ["Okay, that's helpful. And then, my follow-up is at a high-level. Kevin, I don't know if you want to take this one, but you talked about \u2013 it's not necessarily been the pharmacy yet that's been driving the outperformance."]], [" What would you need to see either in capital availability, rate of return or confidence in that precision targeting to allocate more capital to Eagle Ford? And do you need to exhaust your financial goals of reducing debt by $3 billion and delivering on that above 19% dividend growth before you would do that?", ["Great, thank you. And my follow-up goes back to the earlier discussion on the Eagle Ford, and I'm going to be trying to tie Bob and Irene's questions together."]], [" And then just as you think about cash longer term after fiscal 2019, where do you think sort of the right level to get that?", [" And I guess, if you don\u2019t end up seeing offers at what you believe are fair prices, what would you consider in terms of other levers to cash, especially given that the dividend is well above market, first goal still 30 to 35 payout."]], [" So what else am I missing when I look at that calculation, since it's adjusted with the elevated trends last Q1?", ["Okay, thank you. And then just a couple of numbers question and going back to the Personal Auto book. If I look at your underlying loss ratio this Q1 compared to the adjusted last year, it seems like there's about 2.5 points of deterioration. You guys said year-over-year the delta was about 1.5 points that changed from tenure."]], [" Can you talk more about how you're thinking about distribution strategies in North America?", ["Thank you. Guys just thinking big picture, you've made great progress operationally quality of sales have improved, you remain confident in the consumer positioning."]], [" What percent of AdWords advertisers are buying Search only versus buying Search and YouTube at this stage?", [" And then second question, on YouTube a lot of discussion here about direct response impact and the opportunity there."]], [" Just wanted to understand from an end-game perspective, once you do have the three-year $1 billion investments and you've completed that cycle, is the intention, then, to kind of continue to re-up and reinvest or allocate capital towards further building out that platform or, at that point, would you go through a strategic review?", ["Got you. And then, just moving to the renewables side, the contracted renewables, then, is the deregulated side. It looks like, off that $1 billion investment, there seems to be good progress this year in terms of the investments in that business."]], [" So, one, can you give us the slope of the line that you think that's going to kind of go to back to breakeven over the next year or two?", ["Okay. And then if I can just ask one last question on calcimimetics, you gave us the 125 to 150 that is going to go away at some point."]], [" How do think that's going to play out in 2017? And are you confident that you can sort of hold your ground without losing distribution?", [" So volume is the first one. The second question is we're hearing from a number of places that retailers, particularly large retailers, are beginning to demand more reinvestment in price and promotional activity, which seems to be the opposite direction from where you're going."]], [" But could you just talk a little bit again about where you see sort of deleveraging and share repurchase priorities, call it over the next couple years?", ["Okay. That's helpful. And then two other ones, I guess one for you, Walt, and then for Mike. For you, again you know obviously saw that you increased the dividend. That's again consistent with your focus on maintaining and actually growing the dividend. You also announced a $300 million share repurchase, which is about 5% of the current market cap, so nice size. And I recognize that that will be tapped into over time."]], [" I guess, how should we think about the value of the Studio output deal in terms of a differentiator or driver for the Disney streaming when you launch in 2019? And does that become even more meaningful as the home entertainment window continues to wane?", ["Hi. Thank you. Bob, just on the Studio, you guys have been such a stand-out in the box office this past few years and the pipeline continues to look so strong given the tracking early reviews of Black Panther."]], [" So kind of two part question coming out of that; one, are you with the strong headcount growth and GDN mix that are stabilizing are we going to see an acceleration in revenue per head that might cause some break in the linearly in the business? And then also just secondarily can you just talk a little bit about the mix of the type of work you're seeing in The New as it gets to be over 50% of the business and if that's sort of fundamentally different in terms of mix of service lines relative to the core?", ["Hi, good morning guys. I am good. So question just around the mix of business. So I noticed GDN mix down ticked slightly this quarter that's quite unusual. I think that's the first time in years that's happened. And at the same time you had a really strong headcount growth quarter at over 10% but then David in your comments you called out that you're seeing very strong growth in The New in areas like application and services which suggests more like build related activities which I would associate with offshore."]], [" So, is that still kind of the right way to think about that?", ["Thanks, Rick. And then just on the cash generation, I think you had given the number of $2 billion for the remainder of the year and I think the current thinking is this year, you are really focused on paying down debt getting to a net debt level similar to where you were before the deal by the end of the year and then \u201819 having some capacity either for some share repurchase activity, additional M&A etcetera."]], [" When you talked about moving some $24 million, $25 million from A&P to revenue, it will be modeled for '19 that growth in line with sales on the lower base or the higher base?", ["Jane, a quick clarification from you and then one for Lawson."]], [" Should we change our assumptions about a change in the credit quality environment? Are we in a new environment that\u2019s something we haven\u2019t seen before, where it\u2019s just consistent?", ["Okay. Yes, my follow-on is also on a note of expectation versus reality. There has been an expectation, I think in the industry, that there was going to be a quarter or quarters in which the credit quality environment changed dramatically, and it\u2019s been an expectation about CRE, etc. etc. I guess you said that your charge-off ratio had been under 50 basis points for, what, 15 of the last 17 quarters or something like that."]], [" And tying that together with the comments that were made earlier about 421-a, should we be expecting that the -- or do you expect the same-store expense growth to kind of stay at that level until the 421-a burns off, number one?", ["A couple of questions about the New York market, just to follow on some of the commentary earlier about 421-a. When I take a look at the expense growth in that market on a same-store basis, really going to '16, the expense growth was at 7% at '16, 11.5% last year, just about 7% here in Q1."]], [" Is the inclusion of cash flow or ROIC something you think the board would consider?", [" And then the third piece maybe Mike, this one is for you, neither the near-term annual comp or long-term incentive include cash or ROIC, if I'm not mistaken it's normalized EPS, core sales, normalized EBITDA and TSR."]], [" And so, as we think about the business, as you look out beyond this quarter, can the Experience Cloud grow on an organic basis more -- is 20% the message that we should be thinking about as we look at next fiscal year for the growth of the Experience Cloud?", ["Hi. Many thanks. Shantanu, I wanted to try this for you. Going back to the Marketing Cloud and you commented in your formal remarks the Experience Cloud that you expect FY17 to be better than 20% organic bookings growth. And yet, I\u2019m trying to understand how to reconcile, because there was clearly some degradation in the Q4 guidance. And I understand it\u2019s a tough comp where you\u2019re talking about 17%, but that still includes TubeMogul, which is mostly in the quarter."]], [" If you we should think that this is sustainable level for next few quarters, and as the business turned around, their 5G orders are now picked up to a point that they\u2019re driving the growth already? Or is it just that you have more of the systems solution that you talked about in those longer lead products that are driving the business right now and we will see the growth rate decelerating here?", ["Then it was really good to see your commercial communication growing 10% year-on-year for orders. I just wanted to understand."]], [" So can we get an updated kind of starting point for how you see that Commercial Lines underlying loss ratio progressing this year? And can you quantify the level of non cat weather losses that might have impacted that number this quarter?", [" And I understand there's lots of moving parts in the quarter, but that underlying loss ratio in North America was higher than the full year level which was kind of what you pointed to as a starting point there."]], [" Have you seen that continue in April?", ["Okay. That's helpful. And then, Dave, underlying sales in North America were down 2% in your second quarter but orders were up in March. I think you said mid-teens in North America led by oil and gas MRO and turnarounds. It seems like you saw a decent inflection in North American in March."]], [" But just broadly this does not having a bigger export business today put you at a competitive disadvantage given the market landscape?", ["And then, I guess my second question is more just about the competitive in the U.S. pork market. As we think about the prospect of higher pork exports, do you feel that puts you in any sort of competitive disadvantage where some of your bigger packer and processed meat competitors are a bit more vertically integrated and more tied to the export market, might have more visibility in terms of product flow before you fully see that is from thinking specifically in the event of the U.S exporting cold carcasses to China and the net impact that would have on belly and trim markets."]], [" How far into that opportunity do you think you will get in 2019 based on the current customer activity?", ["I wanted to ask about cobalt adoption. You\u2019ve detailed it a couple of months ago, just wondering if you could comment on the traction you\u2019re seeing. And are customers successfully integrating it, or do you see any yield risk.

Thank you very much.

And then just as I think about sources and use of capital, you are looking at the $300 million of development and redevelopment spend which we appreciate that guidance. You have got $170 million of free cash flow that you have talked about, which generally would fund most of that on a leverage-neutral basis, but you are also sort of over-equitizing with the $130 million of forward equity."]], [" But how do we think about incremental margin?", ["And then just back on the incremental margin as you start to \u2013 I know you don't have a ton of visibility into 2018 at this point, you need a few more months of orders."]], [" But can you talk about the conversations you're having with your customers?", ["Scott, OE bookings up 15% year-over-year is the best you've seen this cycle. You already mentioned IMO 2020 bookings."]], [" But is this a conservative guide? Really how should we think about your positioning on this?", [" Because your first half performance has been very strong and in light of sort of the disruption on Ford's trucks, which should catch up in the third and fourth quarter, it seems like that things might be a bit better than you were initially expecting."]], [" So am I understanding that correctly?", [" It sounds to me like a lot of it is transitory related to commodity costs and some operational issues, right. So, that's what it sounds like, but I just wanted to run this by. So it looks like your grain costs are higher by about $100 million, prepared food raw material costs are up by $30 million relative to your previous guidance and then freight, overall guidance is up by $50 million, but let's say half of its assigned to these two businesses. That's $150 million plus sort of headwind relative to your previous guidance and your expectation for EBIT on both those segments is, it\u2019s not down as much, right. So that\u2019s how I'm looking at it, the majority of the change in your guidance primarily in Chicken is related to sort of timing issues as to when your costs are going up versus when the pricing is going through. So there is some looks like issues in terms of operating perfectly that tend to happen that's also included, but it doesn't sound to me like there's anything competitive that's changed dramatically, that's causing the guidance to be slightly lower."]], [" Is there enough growth in products to get us to a positive mix in the second half of the year?", ["So I just want to kind of pick up where Gautam left off. So, as we go into second half year, I think you've threaded the bridge quite nicely, the down 30 basis points. So it looks like synergies will be picking up to maybe 60 basis points, 70 basis points, maybe 80 basis points in 3Q and 4Q. Hopefully, no more charges. So that goes away."]], [" On the commentary about the accelerating leasing, I think given what you said about FirstNet and so forth, is it fair to think that during the course of 2018, we\u2019ll see an acceleration in your leasing activity and then that would set up for 2019 to be better than 2018? And maybe related to that, are we now at the point where all four, all big four of the wireless carriers are now spending at a fairly steady clip? Or is there still some more to come from getting everybody onboard?", ["Great. Thanks very much. Good morning."]], [" Can you just help square that, why it\u2019s not a higher growth rate between here and there?", ["Okay, that\u2019s helpful. As a follow-up I wanted to ask about the free cash flow cadence beyond this year. So you know you are guiding to the full year adjusted free cash flow number around $2 billion, $3 billion. You\u2019ve got this $3 billion target for 2022, I guess counter 2022. You know and applies like a little less than 10% CAGR between here and there, which just seems a little light given what you are talking about from a working capital upside opportunity and synergies."]], [" Why not sort of take the year to do both, so increase promo and ad spending as a percentage of your sales more effectively?", [" And then just more broadly speaking, just going back to your U.S. business, I think certainly makes sense to send a bit more money on the promotional side of the equitation. I guess also I am still curious to hear kind of your thoughts on your total ad spending going down as a percent of sales this year in light of -- again when you hear your competitors raising their ad spending, 200 basis points over the last two years."]], [" How competitive is it and obviously you're being more price disciplined, but love to hear about the opportunity set there as well?", ["And then a comment on the pricing side. Is the pricing limited from ability in the marketplace to some of the aftermarket in the more higher end niche applications, how does it all - could you talk about that side, but then also how does pricing look on the larger projects, those $3 million to $15 million plus kind of range."]], [" I was curious if any of those conversations or your strategic approach to this more broadly is inclusive of your current-owned lot position given that, I believe, Diane had reported at quarter end that you are about I guess roughly 75% owned, almost 200,000 lots of your 261 owned, if there is any kind of thought towards moving some of that own position to any of your land developer partners in a greater effort to become more capital efficient?", ["That\u2019s great, Jon. Thank you for that. I guess just second question going back to your comments, Rick, regarding land how you are going to be purchasing land going forward in the different types of conversations you are having with land developers, which is of course very important and great to hear particularly again leveraging your size and increased strength in the marketplace."]], [" When you look at the core expense leverage in addition to the changing secular mix of the business and gross margin pressure you just mentioned, are we at an inflection here where we\u2019ll get back to 20% to 25% contribution margin or are you happy with faster sales growth and maybe a contribution margin in the teens?", ["Hey, guys. Good morning. First question, Dan, you said you are happy with the return on the investment and your growth drivers but you are disappointed by the profit growth in the first quarter."]], [" Are you investing enough? Is there enough focus? Do you have supply issues? Or is it just not as a strategic imperative? I'm just trying to get a sense because it would strike me that this would be a time in which you'd really kind of put on the gas for tequila and really expand that business significantly?", ["Great thank you very much. I'm wondering Lawson, if kind of give us your assessment of your results in tequila. I mean you've got a fabulous brand, tremendous heritage, it's great liquid, the market is doing very well, but some brands, I think, Don Julio was up about 25%. When you benchmark your results versus a brand like that and I see them as fairly similar brands."]], [" So we can think about what ramping back up the brand voice will be through increased marketing going forward?", ["Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick questions, guys. So number one, I thought I heard you mentioned at some point in the prepared remarks embracing the performance element of the Under Armour brand really sticking to that kind of knitting and its original D&A, I'd love to hear you elaborate on that, especially given kind of the demand for fashion products in the marketplace and how you see Under Armour's unique performance element fitting into the broader marketplace. And then my second question is, if you can give us a sense of the rise and fall and rise again of marketing spend and ad spend for the brand, how much and how large and far reaching was the UA voice at its peak versus 2019."]], [" How does that not feed on itself and become a more of a power slower, faster?", ["Got it. And then as a follow-up, but just to continue along the lines of this pause versus an end of a cycle, can you comment on the power or the influence of this negative feedback loop, because you\u2019re saying right now you\u2019re slowing down your investments, you\u2019re pulling back, you\u2019re seeing customers push out projects."]], [" Where in the organization is there the experience and the depth to kind of guide this big restructuring over the next period of time?", ["All right. Fair enough. And, Don, I guess one follow-up question just on the restructuring and that you're talking about making -- rapidly making some hard choices here in consolidating those 15 selling organizations down to a smaller number than that. You've added a lot of good dental people, but you've also \u2013 a lot of people are gone from Dentsply Sirona here over the past year as well."]], [" Could you just give more of a sense of the pacing of that throughout the year? Like, maybe first half versus second half or even what you\u2019re thinking for the fourth quarter?", ["Certainly. I appreciate the balanced view there. Maybe just one follow-up for Dave. I wanted to ask more specifically on the promotional day decline this year, I think you said down a third North America."]], ["\" But I guess I'm struck sort of with the question of why bother?", ["My question actually goes back to the 2 skincare acquisitions you made. And I know, a, short answer would be, \"Oh, they're so small. They don't move the needle. It doesn't matter."]], [" Are there preparations that you're doing in that part of the business to take advantage of the situation?", ["Good morning everyone. So there's obviously a lot of anticipation of the ASF impact as we get into fiscal 2020. Are there things that you can be doing to ramp up your chicken business in terms of the amount of processing capacity, the breeding cycle, if meat prices are going up next year that's the one area that could actually be accelerated potentially."]], [" Can you just talk about how much debt reduction you expect going forward? And do you have any type of leverage target that you would manage your balance sheet to?", ["It's actually Michael Walsh filling in for Todd. Sean and Dave, you've been consistent in publicly stating your desire to retain an investment grade credit rating. And earlier, you mentioned that as well. You also mentioned debt reduction, and I know ConAgra Brands will get a $675 million payment from Lamb Weston with the spin. You're going to lose a chunk of EBITDA."]], [" So was it really just as simple as until some of the large diameter work starts, you're going to assume less than perfect timing on those start dates, is that really what we should be thinking about with relation to where the guidance is?", [" Stronghold, if I remember correctly, was supposed to do less than $200 million in 2017. We're now talking closer to $600 million in 2018. So that's $400 million of growth, that's more than 10% right there. And you're talking about the large diameter pipeline spreads being, it sounds like more utilized this year than last."]], [" And that will be less linear and more -- it's like how any platform grows, right?", ["I mean I'd expect it'll be largely linear, but with a bit of an uptick as we continue to build out the platform, I mean we announced over the year various platform partners that we've added to Alpha, and these are providers that are plugging into our platform and typically where we get a share of those economics. And I think you'll see at an increasing rate over 2020 and 2021 the number of those kinds of providers on the platform, and you'll see them -- the increasing importance of platform economics."]], [" But given that Windows is a pretty material driver of profitability at Microsoft, if we do start to see a more protracted decline in PC unit sales and you think about your investments going out through the remainder of this calendar year, are there opportunities to sort of flex down the cost structure at this point to preserve profitability in margins? Or should we assume that much of the investments happening right now are really tied to the commercial cloud and some of the lower margin but higher opportunity businesses and maybe there isn't so much of an offset? Just how should we think about contingency planning if we do see a weaker -- an extended weakening in the global economic climate?", ["I appreciate getting the sort of visibility you have into the, as someone earlier alluded to, transactional businesses. It sounds like you feel pretty good or at least stable about the PC outlook for the remainder of this year."]], [" So should we think about this cash build as giving you more firepower for repurchases in year 2? Or might you do something else with that cash?", ["Okay. And then on cash, Rahul, the two of you, the two companies have about $1.4 billion pro forma on the balance sheet, cash, and so you've targeted $2 billion for share repurchases in the first 12 months post close. But given what's on hand and what you're going to generate in the meantime, it seems that you'll end that first year with a lot of excess cash. So I know you're limited in your ability to buy back even more stock in year 1."]], [" The second one is the basic economy which you just rolled out and then eventually, this Gemini rollout in late August, like when should we think of that showing up in unit revenue or maybe your unit revenue doesn\u2019t perform in line with what you would expect, given comps or capacity?", ["Scott, maybe I can ask you, again, just how should we think about when you start to see the benefits to PRASM from three items.

What are the key drivers of giving you confidence in planning around that at this point?", ["Okay. That makes sense. That's helpful. Thanks. And then I guess bigger picture, just thinking about the 2019 outlook relative to the kind of back half experience here in 2018. I know obviously, we've been \u2013 you've been executing on production, taking that up, pointing to the high-end of the 2019 production guide or prior guide. But at the same time, capital has also been moving higher in the last couple of quarters."]], [" So, I wanted to focus more on the second half, if your first half guidance is sort of correct, you still need to see some momentum acceleration in the business in the back half of the year to deliver sort of that 4% type number? Can you just sort of talk about some of the drivers of how you get that momentum acceleration in the back half just given the very material difference in sort of first half versus second half comparables?", ["Good morning. Just a couple of questions. Karen, just I want to start with you on the organic growth outlook and I noticed some questions on the second quarter, but if you think about this year, I mean, your guidance sort of implies 6% performance in the first half and maybe 4% performance in the second half."]], [" So I think, first, is that correct?", ["Hey, Mauricio. So I just want to tie in some of the updated \u2013 the 2018 guidance to your kind of Transformation Plan announcements. So, if you look at the post asset sales of the $1.5 billion EBITDA you're giving, and then if you add in the full run rate to 2020 on the cost of the margin enhancement, I'm getting more like $1.770 billion or something, and I think you had said $1.845 billion."]], [" How different do you think the selling approach of process will be this year, and can you talk about expectations for the market?", ["I have a couple. I\u2019ve lost count of how many direct-to-consumer services you\u2019re launching over the next two to three years. But interested in how you're approaching the revenue model.

You guys have done some of your upfront presentations."]], [" That was our forecast for you to hit three years from now, and you\u2019re here in the second quarter, so is that kind of front-loaded?

Just on the capital guide."]], [" And we look at the scanner data and your trajectory is better, right?", ["Good morning. I have two questions, but a comment first. This is a quarter where you increased sales guidance, actually beat in terms of sales estimates for the third quarter in terms of organic growth."]], [" I asked you a while back about this, as it related to the Marine core strategy that had been laid out, but if the Navy moves aggressively in this direction, how might that affect your core programs, the larger ships and your business mix? And what\u2019s your understanding of how the Navy is looking to proceed here?", ["Good morning. Thank you. I want to go back to, Mike, the discussion about unmanned systems.

Good evening, everybody. So a couple of questions for me. First off, Pralhad, really do appreciate all the Vanadis commentary."]], [" Now, is the main driver of that the shifting of the closing out of these high-volume communities?", ["Thanks. Just want to come back to the order number and make sure I'm understanding the comments you're laying out. I mean, a lot of folks are going to look at the 8% deceleration from the 15% to 17% you had in the second half of last year, also somewhat especially relative to peers at odds with their comments about the strong spring selling season."]], [" What does that compare to? Like what would capacity growth have been? And how do you get to that number?", [" As I think about some of the hard choices you\u2019ve had to make, cutting your worst flying, focusing on your best and combined with basically no capacity growth, it feels like the RASM benefit could be very, very substantial. So for example, in the fourth quarter in the press release, I think you called out 2 to 3-point tailwind from the MAX being grounded."]], [" Could you just bridge us through why it's not higher?", ["Good morning, all. Just the specifics, firstly, on your volume guidance. Can you just walk us through how we get to the fourth quarter guidance which is specified to be 330,000 to 340,000 barrels a day oil equivalent, but then within oil, we're interested in the 182,000 to 186,000 barrels a day. It seems low relative to where you are today."]], [" Can you talk about the potential of actually increasing that market share and much more significantly?

And then looking at the revenue synergies that you\u2019ve outlined some of that obviously is State Street revenue. But you still only imply maybe a 5% to 6% market share of that $8 billion pool. So can you talk about, you mentioned obviously and we all know this industry is incredibly fragmented and has historically been driven by sort of traders' decisions in usage of the products."]], [" Just maybe for you specific on when you think the supply issues will be fully behind you and also I heard some comments on the robot, but just to be clear when do you expect the full launch of the robotic platform for Total Knee?", ["Great.

So quickly for Bryan, I was wondering, if you could just touch on two good things for us."]], [" Have you recovered all of that at this point? Is it more to come into FY 2020?", [" In the past few reporting releases you did call out resin headwinds. I think it totaled over $15 million."]], [" And then, if so, can we expect maybe greater gains in that metric as you guys get further along in the process?", ["Right. Yes, no, that makes total sense. And if I could just follow-up on that precise point. There is \u2013 from the pricing perspective, there\u2019s only one rail that we can actually truly kind of calculate what's being realized solely on price or core price. One of the proxy metrics we use at least and this could be wrong or not is revenue per revenue ton-mile, which I think we look at as a proxy for price, so if I look at it on that metric the growth in revenue per revenue ton miles for the company was up about 5% in the second quarter. It actually decelerated from 6% in the first quarter.

With regard to the cash in and the cash out, you got a net benefit of, I guess, around $900 million or so this year and with an 8% return, that goes down to a fairly small number in 2020, but with the 12% return you have year-to-date, it's about $350 million positive in 2020."]], [" Given that, how do we think about the requirement for you \u2013 for GD to invest in CapEx over the next several years?", ["So, Phebe, as you said, good performance across the board.

And then related to that just so as a clarification, so you are saying the second quarter pressure is on gross margin for the beer business would be slightly less than what we saw and then compounded the cadence through the rest of the fiscal year given that FX has been more favorable now that the beers are depreciating or should we still see some sort of the same magnitude pressure on the second quarter?", ["Hi, good morning everyone."]], [" How should we think about on a longer-term horizon over the next 12 months or even longer how those two should help on the on-premise license or annuity business, on the cloud in Azure?

And you're seeing that, Elyse, and that's played out sort of in the first 9 much of the year. Look, Q4 -- I just want to emphasize that trend line, that overall progress is exceptional, and the team's been great on the treaty side, on the fact side, the alternative side just absolutely exceptional, and I think we see that trend line. Again, we always come back to sort of those trend line on a particular quarter. As you highlight, Q4 is unique. It's unique sort of in history, it's, by the way, our smallest quarter as you've described. The comp is very unique. We know what was going on last year is going to create a sort of headwinds in the fourth quarter, no doubt, in terms of where we are.

Thanks for the thoughts on that, Tom. And then, going from bigger picture maybe to some more nut-and-bolt types of questions, and I'll turn it over, in terms of the variance and the change in EBITDA in Packaging, when I look at second quarter 2018 versus 2017 and looking at the year-on-year that occurred and the improvement in performance there, it works out to roughly about $58 a ton in the second quarter of this year versus $39 a ton in the second quarter of 2017.

And lastly, on the margin bridge \u201820 versus \u201819, so the 100 basis points or $100 million EBITDA growth. I appreciate that it\u2019s early in the year, but taking some of the discrete items it looks like you have the pieces to get you above the $100 million increase.

So some commentary there."]], [" So if you can comment on that?", [" And Europe, the big jump seems to be one-off; so I don't think I can count on Europe growing EBITDA margin next year.

Thank you for taking my question and great to see the diversification in the business playing out. You guys -- Hock, you provided a longer term view on wired. Kind of more near term, looks like the double digit quarter-on-quarter growth in April is going to take you guys back to year-over-year growth. Given the trend that you\u2019re seeing, strong datacenter and cloud, you\u2019re ramping several new big ASIC programs, hopefully, kind of normal seasonal trends in broadband through the end of the year; second half you\u2019ll be ramping Tomahawk 3, Jericho 2 but maybe still some headwinds on service provider."]], [" I know you've outlined from first half in tax and margins, but where is the most realistic opportunity to cover that GAAP, double-digit EPS or as mid-single digit growth, the new algorithm despite what you are achieving online in the International business and with Champion?", [" Can you talk big picture what if I specific example around how you see the path ahead, to get back to this double-digit levels."]], [" I guess, it was back in September of 2015, you held an Analyst Day, and highlighted for us several of the different technology initiatives that are underway and \u2013 just wondering if you can provide us with an update on where that stands?", ["Sure. Okay. That actually \u2013 that makes a lot of sense and understood on the sequential change in the OR and certainly on finally getting to a point where you\u2019re seeing the year-over-year margin improvement. And just in terms of, just a last question here."]], [" So do you think you can maintain sort of that 40% online sales growth into the back half and how much of that contributes to the updated comp outlook versus say, share in Baby and Toys in these key seasons coming up?", ["Understood. And then in terms of the e-commerce growth, you call that a big lift from the one-day sale, but at the same time you're scaling a lot of fulfillment options into the back half."]], [" And then does it just continue to layer on as you grow that? And then kind of what size or target balances would you expect over the next year or two or three?", ["I guess kind of a follow-up on Laurel Road acquisition. I just want to make sure I fully understand this. So, they no longer do gain on sale.

This is Neil calling in for Vincent. A couple of questions on Mosaic Fertilizantes.

So, you see a balanced supply demand outlook for DRAM. I think, industry capacity entering this year was about 1.1 million wafer starts per month but as you guys know, the DRAM suppliers are losing effective capacity like every time they do a technology migration I think something to the tune of like 15% capacity loss. And then bit per wafer is also going down every time they do technology migration."]], [" How should we think about gross margin and operating margin existing the year?", ["And then, Devinder, on the profitability front if you run the numbers from Q1 guidance to what you need to be exiting Q4 at to hit the full year number, you could see revenue up well over $1 billion Q1 to Q4. I\u2019m a little bit surprised that despite that, the gross margin guidance isn\u2019t a little bit better. I know you guided the full year to greater than 41 with Q1 at 41. But I\u2019m curious if you look at Q4 run rate that\u2019s north of a billion higher than the Q1 run rate."]], [" So maybe just can you talk a little bit about bringing the earnings forward a week?", [" You had the 4.5% sort of long-term debt cost. And clearly, you're financing at least, additionally short-term, then you're going to go out. So that would have been a positive offset to warehousing some of these dilutive assets that you're bringing oat the balance sheet. It just seems like a pretty wide spread, that number should be closer to, call it, maybe $4.10 for the balance -- for the year versus the $4.025 midpoint. And maybe you can just be a little bit more specific in terms of the building blocks or each of the pieces of what's going on. And then wrapped around in that, I mean, as guys moved your earnings a week earlier, I don't know if that is indicative of being -- going out and being arguably in the market, either debt or equity -- and/or equity."]], [" And then, on the synergy targets, the $50 million revenue raise by year-end 2020 on revenue synergy, and $100 million raise on costs synergy for year three exit rate, what specifically changed in the last few months, to give you the conviction to raise the targets so early on?", ["Good to see."]], [" Is it macro driven? Is it the commercial initiatives that are ahead of schedule?

So I apologize, this first one is a bit repetitive.

What\u2019s your latest thoughts on the markets there?", ["Okay. And then, I appreciate the clarification. My question then is turning to China and your outlook for excavator sales. You had guided plus 30% and you had called that the cycle was above normal this year and that\u2019s how you were being cautious. Now we\u2019re up 70% year-to-date."]], [" What's your philosophy, what's your strategy about dividend and an increase in the dividend yield?", ["Hi guys. I have a question on security and question on dividends. Starting with the dividends, you grow faster than Cisco. You take share in key markets. You generate very healthy cash flow.

Tom, you mentioned that the guidance does not include anything from FirstNet, the broadcast auction or the Mexican wholesale network.

And a quick follow-up to Helane's question. I apologize for sounding like a broken record. I've asked about loyalty on several of the calls this season. But the Virgin acquisition kind of put California into play, in my opinion. You've acknowledged stepped up competition there with Southwest.

Maybe starting with the CEHE rate case. I understand there\u2019s a lot of moving parts that\u2019ll go into the 2020 guidance that\u2019ll be provided in February. But Scott, when you mentioned that \u2013 just when we\u2019re trying to put some pieces together, your original guidance, which had the $182 million midpoint, had about, I guess, the $1 billion of spend that you weren\u2019t getting the recovery and return on, and the PFD would result in $27 million of operating income decrease from the current rates.

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. My question is for Fareed. By the way, welcome to the company. Cash flow, you've got a bunch of tailwinds with free cash.

A lot of the growth in the last few years has come from price/mix. So I'm just wondering if you can elaborate on more specific programs to really drive consumption and volume increases in Frito-Lay.

If I adjust for that, the quarter's underlying effective tax rate on a consolidated basis was just shy of 20%. And the annuities segment was, I think, under 15%, maybe even closer to 14%.

And then, Mike, on the supplemental page where you provide 2019 outlook, I don\u2019t if that's markets in general or you are specifically providing Essex revenue or rent projections. But, suffice it to say, you are looking at 3 -- call it 3% rent growth for next year on that age. And this year, rents are up 2.3%, revenues up 2.8%. It sounds like the environment for next year isn\u2019t going to be too dissimilar revenue-wide for this year, given that occupancy sounds like on the whole will be flat."]], [" And given that the power market will stay tough in 2018, how do you reconcile the significant overall firm-wide CFOA improvement with a very tough power market again in 2018 and maybe further out?", ["Hi, thank you. Just a question I guess I am looking at power and the relationship of that to your commentary of significant CFOA improvement in 2018. Because I guess a lot of the CFOA shortfall this year is because of power, and you said there's, I think, $3 billion less cash than expected in that business. It's obviously a backlog business. I would guess the pro forma power backlog today, including energy connections, is $100 billion or so."]], [" Is that on the table is that kind of where the industry is at given this persistent reimbursement rate pressure?", [" I mean, obviously, there is precedent for playing a little harder when it comes to declining reimbursement rates and just not offering the Walgreens network in certain PBM offerings."]], [" Given that everybody's credit quality looks great right now, and the underlying FICO looks similar across your peers, maybe give us a little more perspective?

Then my quick follow-up would be around the climate division."]], [" But doesn't the second quarter have a tough comp and also fewer shipping days with leap year last year? And so, does this mean that all of the real strength is in the second half of the year Q3 and Q4? How do we think about the cadence on aftermarket growth as we go through the year?", ["So, Nick on \u2013 just following up a little bit on aftermarket. I wanted to peel the onion a little bit and maybe get a sense of your guidance bridge from really \u2013 from this first quarter plus 3.5% to the mid to high single digits for the year. So, let's throw out a couple things. You've said that the commercial transport was stronger in the quarter than the average at about plus 5%. Business jet, obviously, is still week, holding that back. Fewer shipping days in the quarter, so it seems like we should add about 3% to all these numbers."]], [" Are you concerned that the underlying issues of Pizza Hut International would impair the core operating profit growth over the longer term? Or do you think that those issues are more just isolated to this year?", ["Thank you. My question is on the core operating profit guide. I know the guidance update today was just based on 2018. As I look at the refranchising and the G&A savings benefit that's more of a timing mismatch that would have worked itself out anyway."]], [" So are you seeing weakness there as well?", [" And then I also noticed that the Tier 2 cloud in terms of rankings a little bit below where it used to be."]], [" Any update on FX?", ["That's helpful, Gary. And just on the guidance as a follow-up. Any -- it looks like FX was worse."]], [" And then looking forward there are a couple of new fabs coming online Greenfield fabs and I am trying to assess how I should think about your new product and a scaling should we expect your revenue to or a percentage of your system revenue as a percentage of WFE finally to hit 10% plus as your design wins are scale especially for 3D NAND and two of these new fabs for 90 plus layer 3D NAND manufacturing and would that give you the opportunity to see a material increase in memory especially NAND?", ["Okay, helpful."]], [" What gives you both the confidence and visibility, especially as just about every macroeconomic forecast out there has some degree of economic downturn between now and then?", ["Great. Thanks so much and congrats on a fantastic and to a phenomenal year, guys. Your new fiscal \u201823 guidance implies you will organically double the size of the company over the next four years, add massive scale and implying you\u2019ll be able to sustain a roughly 20% compounded growth rate."]], [" I guess the question -- turning to the asset sales, as we have picked over the dividend quite a bit, is how do you think about kind of the what's on the chopping block, how you are thinking about it, how you are thinking about the cash generation of some of these businesses?", ["Good morning, everyone."]], ["?", ["Really helpful. And on the U.S., can you speak, Paul, to what you think as a sustainable rate of revenue growth for your business here. And that\u2019s in the context of, and I know it's only a quarter, but you had 3 on a 3 and of course you had some inventory builds in the second quarter. So it seems like your business really has consistently trended in the 4s and 5s. But you think about some of the things that have come up in this call and it seems like it might be more reasonable to start thinking about 3s and 4s. But this component of your business, obviously your global opportunities are huge. So could you just speak to what you think sustainable growth here is in the U.S."]], [" But, can you give us an idea just in broad terms whether -- or at what rate perhaps as a percentage of those test rates that you\u2019re actually producing those, and those are actually contributing to say, 2Q volumes?", ["Got it. Thank you. And then, if I could ask another question about the Cat Scratch Fever wells in the Delaware Basin, I guess, there is two parts. One, you guys have been pretty open to the fact that those 10,000 BOE a day rates, those are test rates."]], [" Is that just leveraging 600 megahertz as well as the Sprint mid-band that we\u2019re talking about there? Or does that require a millimeter wave to get those types of speeds? And I\u2019m just trying to figure out in there, sort of what your potential interest might be in the millimeter wave and CBRS auctions, should they come up over the next year in change?", ["Hey, guys. Thanks. Two questions, if I could. Maybe first for Neville, if we go back to \u2013 excuse me one of the questions \u2013 a couple questions ago, just around the speeds, capabilities and talking about 450 megabit per second."]], [" How much do we need? Let's say, that we had short-term rates go down and the economy does well and so eventually that begins to round up at the back-end of the curve slightly, how much of a round up would you need to be able to step in and be able to hedge the balance sheet more proactively to take away some of this downside risk and be able to begin to kind of bite at the apple again to restructure the portfolio? Is it 10 basis points, 20 basis points, 30 basis points, 40 basis points? How many basis points on the long end do we need to have a little bit better environment once we do see some loosening on the short end?", ["And then when we think about -- when you're talking about hedging, but also when you\u2019re thinking about your securities portfolio, you are sort of doing some restructuring last year, which was -- is very valuable at this point that you did what you did last year, but you probably could have done more of that as well."]], [" But notably absent from that -- and now listen, I live in an Excel spreadsheet, right?", ["Well if you don't mind, I just want to follow-up; because you did mention you are going to control what you can. And in your opening comments, I think you mentioned revenue management, your role of economy basic, mention of the fair structure of ULCCs."]], [" So, what areas of improvement are you seeing that gives you confidence that the underlying trends improve in the second half of the year?", ["Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just first on the guidance, perhaps this is an overly simplistic view, but historically HCA has earned around 25% of their full-year EBITDA in the second quarter, which implies a run rate that's slightly below $8.4 billion for the full year."]], [" What type of feedback are you getting from the Mid-Market and Select brokers and the employers on the cross-selling value proposition Express to Cigna and vice versa?", ["Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Following up again on the Mid-Market and Select growths and what you're expecting to see post the deal close. Think Mid-Market, you've grown year-over-year single digits. Select is well into the teens it looks like."]], [" Can you comment on sort of the rate of how far in advance you're booked versus the same time last year just so we can think about maybe the magnitude of yield growth a little bit?", ["Great. Thank you. Just kind of looking to get a little more insight into 2019. I wonder if you could \u2013 you mentioned that rate and volume ahead, so sounds like yield's likely to grow."]], [" And then, from a more macro standpoint, talk about the margin profile of that business and how it's changed over the last couple of years and where it could get to?", [" Maybe talk a little bit about the growth rate in that business in 2018 versus 2017."]], [" What are you embedding as far as recoveries and amounts that are not able to be recovered?", [" And then as you guys are thinking about your growth rate."]], [" How should we think about those two businesses in 2019?", [" I know Fashion Bed was probably roughly a $200 million or so business last year and Home Furniture, half that business is motion and half stationary and that was probably around $370 million combined."]], [" So, can you talk a little bit about what the plan is for repo and what the cadence might be once you are able to do that?", ["Awesome, thanks. And then just as my follow-up question, you guys almost always are at or above the high-end of the earnings range. So, if I assume that, that\u2019s going to happen again in the third quarter that would put you at basically $950 million to $960 million in annualized earnings, so the stock will be trading at roughly 10.5x to 11x earnings. So I would think that you are chomping at the bit to basically buyback your stock at these levels."]], [" And then, second on the asset sale front, the $500 million target that you have for the year, the Ohio sale of $50 million and this Kazakhstan sale of $24 million, do they count against that or are they separate from that?", ["I see."]], [" So I guess the question is, what am I missing that the comparable would be lower in the second half versus first half? Just help us understand at a higher level the slower revenues in the second half?", ["Okay. That's very helpful. And then backing up for second, just looking more broadly at your guidance for the company. It also implies that revenues only about 2% growth in the back half, off of over 4% in the first half. So as we start to look through some of the detail and North America sounds more stable, the international order books, I think, for the fall are much stronger than even the spring, you have got FX at your back now for the first time in a few years and then some of the headwinds from Tommy, G-III and Mexico start to go away in 4Q."]], [" Did I hear that right?", ["Okay. And then on the share buyback again, I wanted to clarify Tony your comment. So, you had bought back 16 million shares through the end of the year. And did I hear it right that based on the accelerated and other programs that by early March that 16 million would become 19 million. So in other words another 3 million would have been bought by early march."]], [" So how much of a track record in terms of incremental margins?", ["Got it. Thank you for that, Brian. So maybe just coming back to margin progression in TPS. So you got strong revenue growth this year, you topped up your guidance today versus last quarter. I think that make sense. We got somewhat limited historicals from last cycle."]], [" But it all begs the question of is this the right move, the right shift or has the industry perhaps gone too far? Should we be pivoting back and putting more back into the traditional pull-based marketing, if you could weigh in with your high order or high level thoughts on that?", ["Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then high order question for you Denise, you mentioned mix shift in terms of the AC&T spend that you have had against the business, I think we look industry wide, we have seen a pretty similar mix shift, the traditional pull day spend behind the A&C that rolls to SG&A has been shrinking industry wide for quite a few years now, more and more has moved into trade. And at the same time, volumes have become pretty challenged, private labels making more inroads. You are now seeing the deflationary impact kind of roll through your P&L and pressure margins as well. And you are not alone on that."]], [" I understand there's no issues in the energy beyond what you\u2019ve already taken, but are you trying to imply that maybe we're back to sort of more normal provision numbers or more normal charge-off rates versus kind of where we\u2019ve been at a very favorable period, or are you seeing any kind of deterioration that would suggest the higher provision as warranted?", ["Okay, got it. And then just one other question. In terms of the provision guidance, the 15 to 20 basis points, or actually specifically the $25 million to $35 million per quarter, it seems like that kind of implies a little bit higher provision than what your prior guidance was."]], [" How much capacity on PHP do you want to have just for the Texas Intrastate business under the scenario like you said theoretically basis should be wider for longer?", [" And then as you guys think about capacity commitments on that line, recognizing the intrastate asset systems over 7 Bcf, you got over 130 Bcf of storage connecting between this and possibly GCX."]], [" Is that a function of pipeline activity being up significantly higher?", ["The two questions I have first, John, is on the Public Safety activity in the quarter. You commented that you'd signed as many deals in the first quarter as you did through August last year."]], [" Is that the way you think about it, or do you think yours is structured somewhat differently, or somehow there\u2019s a different proposition where you actually see a restaurant margin going up, and it\u2019s accretive not dilutive to restaurant margin, I\u2019m talking about the average margin now, not maybe an incremental margin?", [" And third, maybe Jack, I know, you\u2019ve talked about delivery economics in the past. But just to be clear, when you look at a delivery sale, I think it\u2019s generally understood, it\u2019s lower margin because of the commission, and it\u2019s hard to offset that even if the higher check."]], [" Just does Nielsen have the same value-add as the world transitions to those forms of media delivery? From the standpoint that if there\u2019s less ad supported, or if ad supported is increasingly digital and more natively generating data instead of valuing Nielsen\u2019s proprietary data aggregation capability, does Nielsen just have a less valuable role and monetize less as you \u2013 as the world transitions to those forms of digital media delivery?", ["Yes, thank you. I guess maybe a different variation of the structural media question. So I guess the concern seems to be, hey, you\u2019re replacing this previous position of strength with a new one where you are generating revenue, but maybe there\u2019s less value add. So we\u2019d love your perspective both on SVOD and I guess ad-supported digital video or video-on-demand."]], [" So at what point, either from a time perspective or a revenue recovery perspective, should we expect you to start to match some of your competitors in terms of increasing your investment in R&D, et cetera?", [" And then maybe more broadly for you both Rami and Ken is that, you talk about that you want to be seen as, and you feel like you want to be aggressive in new opportunities, but right now you're continuing to manage OpEx and it\u2019s continuing to decline as your revenues are pressured. But all of your competitors around you are increasing their R&D to attack a lot of the same opportunities you're eyeing."]], [" And then the related question is what are you seeing in terms of the customers on Grub find you through Grub versus the Pizza Hut App, is it -- I assume a very different customer base as we've heard from other restaurants but given that Pizza Hut is so well known for delivering Pizza, I was just trying to figure out to what extent the Grub orders are incremental?", ["Great, thank you. I have a question about Pizza Hut and it's sort of a two-part question. One is I know that you're repositioning the State and it sounds like dine-in is still quite a bit softer to go. But I guess I'm -- when I think about the U.S. so much a carry out and delivery business that the implication is that even that business might still be sort of muted in terms of comps. And I guess I'm trying to understand, is there a scenario where you're repositioning the state that's happening at a time when aggregators are taking away some of the growth that the Pizza category has had kind of to itself for so long."]], [" With the leverage expected to hold at this level, how are you thinking about financing the remaining investments, is that through the ATM or are there more asset sales to come beyond the $70 million that it sounds like you incrementally announced this quarter?", ["Got it, okay. That's what I thought, I just wanted to make sure that it's \u2013 so it sounds like it's an all-encompassing bucket now, as opposed to some incremental growth investment. So okay that makes sense and then I guess second part of the question is just for the balance of the year, obviously seasonally your maintenance CapEx is always low in the first half, so you have more in the second half, you've got the growth investments."]], [" So can you just tell us what you are expecting in terms of overall volume growth for 2019?", ["Great. It sounds like that's an intermodal comment. Can you just help unpack your full year revenue guidance in terms of volume mix and maybe some other components, because if I look at low single digit revenue growth, I am assuming you guys get at least 3% price which doesn't leave much room for volume or mix growth there, even if you adjust for the fuel surcharge headwind."]], [" But are we starting - I'm trying to kind of get out here is what's kind of the normalized capital growth rate?", ["Understood, appreciate it, still great performance there. And I guess the only real nip, when you look at the quarter, the Life Science backlog and I realized last year we had phenomenal growth there. I think it was up 43% in the prior year quarter before being down 7% on a year-over-year basis this time and up one sequentially."]], [" So just to the point about that incremental ROI and obvious customer reception you're seeing, is there -- would there be a reason to push that marketing rate up more meaningfully?", ["A nice start to the year. Barry, you mentioned several times -- you mentioned marketing or something along the lines today, and I think you have a fairly low marketing rate as a percent of sales at the Company level, let alone on a brand level."]], [" Should we expect on your capital total payout into grow and Bruce may be give some insight on how you are thinking about dividend versus buyback in future CCAR?", ["Yes. Thank you for taking my call. Good morning. My first question is on future capital return. Clearly the announcement out of the 2017 CCAR was very strong. And you have stronger loan growth than peers. That being said, the 11% target for the end of third quarter on CET1 seems robust still relatively to your risk profile and size. And I am wondering as we look further out over the next two or three years."]], [" How of the battle will have been won in B2C versus B2B, and do you think you need to be deeper in content management to get there?", ["I have a question for Marc B on the Marketing Cloud, which obviously had a great quarter in Q1. But one of your competitors in the space is now adding commerce functionality by way of an acquisition, which I think as many investors comparing the different strategies in the market. And if we look out in the future when Salesforce is 20 billion plus in-size and then reflect back and how you got there."]], [" Is it going to be mainly come through OpEx where that margin can go up next year a bit and we should think about gross margins closer to how we have may be seen it here in the current quarter?", [" I know you don't guide on margin, but if there is some leverage to be had in the model, we have got business mix as an issue, ERP investments, restructuring."]], [" And from your perch at the Navy board, do you sense that there's any movement there to think again, about where tower sit in terms of the Navy benchmark hierarchy?", [" That'd be the first question be helpful. And second question will be, Sprint's been doing some kind of innovative things with LTs in terms of travel impact, their capital intensity with the strand mount network architecture. And it's conceivable that, could increase in terms of its use. It could go to Comcast, go to charter. Could you kind of talk about how you see that approach to network deployment impacting macro tower demand. And then the last question, I guess, is for you, Jim, in particular, is kind of one of the funniest things that's happened this year. In the sectors that big fun families have been changing their benchmarks to include towers."]], [" Just for clarity sake, is that 4% total, 3 points of incremental sales and about 1 point in price increase? Is that just 3%? And is it really balanced, quote, unquote, or is it really dependent on innovation, so we're seeing any wavering interest in your innovations at this point?", ["And then just my last one, on that balance, you say in your press release and you've talked before, from an innovation perspective in 2018, three points of incremental sales and about 1 point of price increases, those are the words in the release."]], [" So Katherine, I think you kind of alluded to at the beginning of the call, but can you maybe help us understand how you view enabling technologies in spine?", ["Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two Mako related ones for me."]], [" Is that what still baked into the new guidance?", ["So, I'll ask my question and related follow-up upfront here.

And how do you think about dividends versus buybacks in a time period where the CCAR isn't getting more difficult?", ["Got it. And the second question is for Beth. Clearly, with a CET1 of almost 10%, you have a lot of capital for your risk profile and your size, and you'll be continuing to build it over time."]], [" In terms of the enumerated assets subject to divestiture, the $20 billion, can you give us an update of what you think the cash conversion, the Industrial free cash flow conversion on those businesses are? And the spirit of the question is what are we playing for here?", ["All right, I will keep it quick."]], [" How quickly could we see some of those programs advancing and potentially coming to market? And maybe you could just tell us, which one or two you're most excited to see in the near term?", [" And if you could also comment on some of the administration's efforts around international pricing, again, a potential risk point for KEYTRUDA that would be helpful. And then, just as a follow-up on for Roger. Roger, how quickly the Company emphasized a lot of vaccines, opportunities for the business going forward. But most of them were Phase 1."]], [" So, can you talk a little about some of the feedbacks you are getting?", [" And then what sort of feedback have you gotten kind of early on from the channel as to what makes people kind of jump, but I know Andrew you talked about your primary goal here as you know kind of ease of use in the product and getting people to understand the implicit value of subscription."]], [" So -- and how long do you expect the market share to improve in emerging markets?", [" And for you to recover a share, I'm assuming the household cleaning brands or the softener brands."]], [" I mean have you contemplated at all the fact that this maybe more permanent than just a six month production cut?", [" And plus the potential that the U.S. export market is more permanently damaged, particularly with South America producing near record crops this year."]], [" Is there any \u2013 have you kind of adjusted your expectations about ratable versus getting license upfront in the back half as well? Meaning do you now have like an assumption for more ratable revenue coming from the Blue Coat side of the equation into the back half as well?", ["Got it. That's super helpful. And, Nick, just on the full year 2018 guidance, I want to make sure I fully understand the bridge from the guidance prior to the \u2013 or the guidance coming out of last quarter to guidance coming out of this quarter. So there's the puts and takes. You impacted for like $25 million in revenue that got put on to the balance sheet this quarter. The divestiture taken out of the guidance and you sort of added back some incremental benefit from FX."]], [" Is it fake math or good math to kind of compare that $300 million, $320 million to the $900 million of cost saves and think that the message you\u2019re sending is that maybe a third or so of that $900 million is on the comp line?", ["Okay. Then just changing to follow up to one of the other questions that has arisen a couple times on the comp accrual. Just trying to do a little math around it - if I take that one percentage point and I apply it to the $8 billion of revenue run rate that, as you point out, has kind of been a stable number for the last four quarters, I get a little over $300 million."]], [" I just wanted to ask a bit, how these high take rates for some of these advanced features influence both revenue growth and drop-through margins, I mean could it actually add a couple of 100 basis points of growth into next year?

And then just any thoughts on this $12 billion farmer subsidy, how it would work and any sense of how much of that would potentially be going towards equipment?", ["Yes, good morning guys."]], [" So, can you kind of help us understand the magnitude maybe of those headwinds and what's driving it?", ["I see. Thanks. And then on the currency headwinds you're seeing in South America, depending upon the performance of what was previously called consolidated IO, the headwinds there seem quite large given that International was softer while China was a record."]], [" My second question is do you expect more disposition to be announced next year, John in you introductory remark you said you were still identifying non-strategic underperforming businesses for disposition, but any initial idea on what the impact could be next year on top of the 3% in the first half, are we talking an extra 2, an extra 4? And then the last one is the impact on margin from disposition to the business sold are lower in line or higher margin than the group?", ["Yes, good morning.

Can you sort of talk about how you sort of think the virtual MVPD contribution as part of that would broadly be in 2019 given your position.

Thank you. Back to slide 11 on the end market outlook. And I know you feel very confidently about the categories that are in the strong demand area, which is all well and good. But, if you could maybe bless these numbers, I\u2019m just curious.

Thank you and congratulations, Brian, on the new role. I wanted to ask two, if I may. One is about the quarter that just passed, and then sort of going forward. So, in terms of the quarter that just passed, I guess I was surprised at what appears to be a fairly quick impact you might have be having, a couple of things that we've seen are maybe new creative around marketing and then a waste management initiative that looks like it has some pretty big opportunities in terms of \u2013 in restaurant waste management."]], ["6%, so I'm just wondering what's keeping that throttle back for FY\u201919?", ["My question is for Ron and it has to do with your outlook for the free cash flow of the business in FY\u201919, you talked about free cash flow as a percent of revenue in the range of 19% to 21%.

Can you talk about expectations on potato costs as you look later into calendar 2017 and into 2018 and if that outlook has gotten more or less constructive in year-end? And maybe a corollary to that is how should we think about the flow through of what has been fairly healthy price realizations on the processing end back upstream to the farm level and how you can get commodity cost deflation on potatoes in an environment where you are actually realizing very healthy net pricing?", ["Maybe a question on potato costs.

George, I just want to go back to your comments around the branded side and that primarily everything today is driven more on the generic side and pricing competition, but you brought the branded expectation down from roughly 10% down to the expectation of 7% to 9%, can you talk, is that what you are seeing right now, is that kind of your future look, we have heard from a number of manufacturers that they are lowering their expectation into what their price inflation will be in calendar \u201917, so I want to understand that, number one."]], [" Would you enter enough acquisitions to satisfy that amount, or you almost feel a little overwhelmed with Esterline integration?

And then just asking you a little bit more color on ATEN backlog in the sense, this was the first quarter it was down a little sequentially, obviously still up year-over-year and still good result.

What makes you unique at integrating the business?", ["Hey, Hock, and thanks a lot for taking my question. So, I\u2019ll ask you about Computer Associates as well.

In that 4% to 5%, obviously, that's a relatively consistent growth rate with prior years. And at the same time, there are probably some dynamics in the underlying end markets that are evolving. And what I was most interested in was the nature of just where surgical volumes are taking place in the healthcare system. And the reason I ask is, if you look at what's going on with hospitals seeing slightly lower in-patient days, but yet the device companies are seeing pretty good growth. Help us think through where you're trying to find marginal growth."]], ["65, right?", ["And the second one I guess for Mark Belgya, I know that we\u2019ve gone back and forth on the guidance, in a very specific term -- terms if I take your $7.96 EPS for fiscal year \u201818, that\u2019s 28% tax rate.

That's really what I'm trying to get at is that it's going to cost you over $500 million to finish it, to go to the full 60, OK. At the same time you're saying you're going to spend more CapEx . But looking at your kind of metrics and your cash flows, are you able to do the incremental $500 million of stock buyback and you've got this $150 million, so an incremental $850 million of CapEx .

So, you have always been a cash-rich company and I am starting with this quarter I see a pretty big permanent maybe 10 percentage point decline in your effective tax rate. Last year, your pre-tax income was over $500 million, this year it\u2019s probably going to be closer to $600 million. So that 10 percentage point drop is basically increasing your already sufficient financial flexibility.

I'd be curious, I may have missed this in your explanation, what happened there on the tax rate, and I think we've got an explanation on Andrew Page and T2.

Are you going to be more in line with, say, with an industry average? And is this part of the investments you're making in 2018?", ["Thank you. Just had a couple questions for you. Last night you touted some of your Big Bets and we heard that today as well and some success there.

And so where is the opportunity for Phillips since you've invested in projects that are or through the value chain I have figured you might have a view into sort of where the best sort of incremental opportunities are; how things play off against each other?", ["My first sort of startles [ph] midstream and refining a bit. I'm thinking about storage capacity and needs, particularly in the Gulf Coast and through logistics needs and opportunities over the next couple of years. I sort of see at least two windows here; one being IMO. I'm thinking about a longer hydrocarbon chains here, in particular, medium to longer hydrocarbon chains. One is IMO, we were expecting storage needs for fuel oil, storage needs for different sorts of distillate, changes in crude trade wins and dynamics."]], [" I just want to know, are you implying that you would expect the corporate loss to be lower on a go-forward basis? Or is there \u2013 is a little over $300 million still a decent quarterly loss expectation?", ["Good morning. Ken, just going through the slide that discusses the corporate loss, if I take the $475 million for the 4Q guide and then I strip out the $150 million sort of the midpoint of higher seasonal 4Q expenses and the $95 million of onetime restructuring expenses, that gets me to a corporate loss of about $230 million.

But then also how do we think about your margins in that environment as well?", ["Thanks, good morning. I wanted to just touch base on your international outlook.

It\u2019s a 144 to 147 range in fourth quarter on an FFO basis. I realize that you are not providing same-store NOI guidance at this point. But just as we think about some of the moving parts there, maybe if you can kind of walk us through what you expect through the guide sort of the 70 basis point drag that you talked about presumably that\u2019s reversing into next year from the re-tenanting. You have got the CocoWalk and Sunset drag from starting those projects. On the other hand, you have got Assembly and Pike & Rose, the retails coming online, but then you have got the apartment leasing drag.

Just two questions."]], [" So can you help us understand why the incremental EBITDA margins will be worse in the fourth quarter than the third quarter?", ["Neff stand-alone comes in at higher EBITDA margins than 47%. And maybe most importantly, if we\u2019re thinking about 2018, it seems like the fourth quarter maybe the first time in, I don\u2019t know, two years, three years where your rate growth year-over-year could be as much or more than your fleet utilization growth, which historically is a positive mix for profitability."]], [" How much of revenue guide staying the same is really from the mix shift which we\u2019ve seen through the first half of the year and how much from the change and how fuel surcharge is being pushed through the geography of the financial statement?", ["That was a good one. I appreciate it. The shorter question follow-up for Mike and Mike, we\u2019ve seen volumes come down from 3% to 4% to flat to possibly down, but the revenue guidance stayed the same. I can understand the mixed shift and some of that accelerating in the back half of the year, but as I look at the change in IEPS and more revenue, fuel surcharge revenue going from the top line, it looks might -- that might be 2 percentage points. I don\u2019t know if you could help put some context around there."]], [" Are we starting to experience a significant amount of competition for certain types of customers and how should we \u2013 if that is a reason why (25:56) we factor that in?", ["Okay. I actually do have one more question, sorry, on Retail since you have your retail guru on the call with you. There's obviously been a significant move by your competitors to enhance their retail sales channel capabilities. We're also in an environment with very low volatility and very low pricing. Your customer count was up in the quarter, but your EBITDA results were lower."]], [" Could you help us to kind of frame the size of that either as a percentage of total Oil and Gas segment or sort of the annual revenue run rate that gas distribution is on right now?", ["Two quick questions.

Or is there something else moving around in the margins in 2020?", ["That\u2019s helpful and thanks also for the color in the slides. My second question would be on the segment margin guidance. So I think it\u2019s guided to be flat ex Sensia in 2020 for the year as a whole on the segment margin line. That\u2019s despite flattish sales not down, lower restructuring costs and net restructuring savings of $15 million coming in. So maybe just beyond incentive comp, talk about any other moving parts in that margin bridge. For example, it looks as if you\u2019re dialing in a mix headwind perhaps because discrete is losing as a share of the total pie."]], [" First, just wanted to go back to the windows business for a moment and obviously a huge turnaround there throughout the year, but in the fourth quarter maybe a slight step back due to some of the challenges that you mentioned, you are still expecting margin improvement in 2018, but maybe fallen short of the 10 to 13, which I think most people would not have expected that to be reached in \u201818, but I was hoping to get a little bit better understanding of how you are thinking about the improvement of that business throughout the year, do you expect some of the challenges that you saw in 4Q to persist in the first couple of quarters and for following that for it to be a ramp or any thoughts around the cadence there just given the pullback in margin in 4Q?", ["Thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks also for fitting me in."]], [" What the hit might have been to that region if you have any sense, excluding that event?", ["Okay. No, I appreciate that response, it's helpful, obviously. I guess, secondly, perhaps you gave a little bit more color just now on Northern California and Seattle. I was hoping to get similar maybe a little bit more granularity in terms of what you're seeing in Texas, I believe you characterized it as generally strong. I don't know if there -- maybe you could across the top 3 or 4 markets, maybe give a little more color there. And when you talked about the Southeast region being a little more challenged from the hurricane, I was curious if you had a sense of what that might have impacted from -- in terms of an order growth standpoint."]], [" So, should we expect that volumes will be much better in the first half, and tobacco 21 impacts in the second half and that\u2019s how volumes progress through the year?", ["Hi, thank you. And apologies for the drop. I had a couple of questions. Number one was just on the cadence of volume through the year. So, Q4 2019 industry volumes were minus 4.5% when Q4 2018 comp was minus 5%.

So, I have a couple things. One is, from a top line perspective. At least to our math, based on your disclosures last quarter of sales and growth rates on your acquisitions, all of your acquisitions together this year, including the growth of those acquisitions, should be adding close to 3 points to your top-line growth.

What is different about this cycle versus the older peers that have struggled to maintain that kind of growth?", ["Hi. Congratulations on a spectacular finish. It's been, what, 13 years, 14 years since you went public. Question for Marc. As you look at other large technology companies in software, without naming names, they have had a hard time getting to $20 billion in revenue and maintaining very solid growth rate. How do you think, how should we think about salesforce."]], [" So any reason why maybe you're below that? And is there the potential to maybe accelerate buybacks, drawing down some of the holding company cash, which is at the high-end of your $3 billion to $5 billion range?", ["Yeah, thanks.

Thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to ask three if I may, one on court decisions on from PCSK9 antibody patents that we thought last year, do you think they have any read across to the upcoming Enbrel district court litigation.

When looking at the current status of the 2020 plan on Slide 14, one of the underlying assumptions there is to achieve the $2.54 dividend per share goal is a higher margin assumption. The implied margin for 2020 is now 36.8%. Previously, it was 35.6%."]], [" How you think about allocating capital to build to suite at which seems like to be a very low spread versus spec?", ["And my question is on development. So you guys have about $1 billion development pipeline of which, 55% fleet which is pretty amazing. But if you look at profit margin at the midpoint it's about 17%, you're earning about 40 basis points spread. Some of your peers because they're growing more spec, we seen might be much higher rate to fit the 300 basis points spread. So my question is, when you start thinking about development philosophically about your pipeline."]], [" Can you help us maybe understand what's happening with the actual policy count?", ["Okay. I appreciate the commentary. And then if I could switch gears just to sort of long-term care and the premium rate increases. So in the first half of this year, in the Closed Block, LTC premium growth was about 1% year-over-year maybe slightly less."]], [" Is the deal going to be really the substantive catalyst to get to this range, and what happened to those 2019 enhanced North Star targets?", ["Hi, good morning. I also wanted to get some clarity in terms of your guidance relative to the deal when I compare the slides from the deal presentation and the updated slides today. When I look back at the MBFI deal presentation, you noted 4Q19 North Star targets of 16% ROTCE and ROA of 125 to 135, and you mentioned that you thought that the deal would be 200 basis points enhancing to ROTCE and 12 basis points enhancing to ROA. I\u2019m a little bit confused on a couple of fronts. One, you\u2019re telling us that North Star will be substantially complete by this year and that implies consensus with an ROTCE of 13.8 to an ROA of 1.25. But you did retain your ROTCE target for the combined company and you even increased the ROA range, so I guess I\u2019m wondering what the moving pieces are there."]], [" And then secondly I was wondering if you could unpack more specifically what happened with the margin improvement in the quarter, it looks like you have already captured over 50% of your core or cash or EBITDA goal for the year, so how should we think about opportunities to improve EBITDA even further?", ["Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Hi, two if I could, first you were talking about the porting ratios, if they were a little lower than they were historically, but the gross adds on phones look like they were up and so I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about where the incremental gross adds may be coming from between those at port and the end result what you achieved in the quarter."]], [" The first is, how much does your cash tax rate go up in 2018? And what happens to the cash tax rate in 2019?", ["Thanks very much. Just have a two-part question."]], [" Again, these aren't officially guidance items, but just for our modeling purposes, as we sit here today, are they still reasonable projections, roughly?", ["Okay. Thank you. And then my quick follow-up is you had also, of course, not given guidance on 2019, but you had said previously, you expect: sales for 2019 at the low end of the 2% to 4% range; the gross margin up year-on-year; corporate expenses, I think, down as much as $100 million."]], [" What is the cadence of that? Should we be using the 661 this quarter as the base of losses going forward?", [" And then Randall, in your remarks, you said things would improve in the second half. And John, during your remarks you said that you'd still expect to see challenges."]], [" Is it more expensive to essentially grow this business?", ["Wanted to ask you about your recent performance and the expected one in the context of your, sort of like longer term framework, the way it was communicated that you\u2019re in the best of day a little while ago. So, in particular I think the framework on the revenue side you used call for, 4 to 6 points over market through 2020, 5 to 7 points over the market beyond that. It seems like in 2018 maybe you did 10% over market, are you still planning for 8% in 2019. Are we still within the framework or is there sort of like some upside there, and then similar type of question on the margin front but the other way around. I think that we had been looking 20 bps of expansion in the year initially, may be 30 to 50 beyond that. I think that even excluding some of the macro headwinds, is it fair to say that either we haven\u2019t seen as much expansion as you expected."]], [" When I look at your Q4 results in the context of the full year, it\u2019s basically almost impossible to argue that Oracle is not at the reaccelerating revenue growth inflection point in its transition to cloud, Mark would talk about apps, obviously has been growing mid to high single-digits, which is acceleration from last year, you talked about accelerating the 10% this coming fiscal year, so my question to both you or Safra is when you think about the platform side of the business here at Oracle, that\u2019s been growing at low single-digits, where does that business fit in terms of the lifecycle transition to the cloud in terms of just the trajectory of net revenue growth?", ["Hi, thanks and congrats on really a fabulous fiscal Q4 and thank you for the increased disclosure in terms of on-premise breakdown of outsource platform."]], [" I'm just trying to understand why your numbers are so conservative? Is there something with Fidelis that is not performing or some changes from the conversion that you had not considered before that makes that deal less attractive?", ["Good morning. Looking back to the annual guidance again and sort of where the different numbers are, I'm just trying to understand a couple of different aspects of it. First, you said if you had filled that else for the whole year your earnings would be $0.35 to $0.40 higher. Yet, you adjusted for the delay of potentially a quarter your earnings by $0.25. You took out more for the quarter. Then your share price is about 20% higher than when you announced the deal. So in theory, the Fidelis Care is actually more accretive than it was before. And then you mentioned the out-performance that you had in the quarter being $0.05, but you didn't raised the guidance for the full year by anything more than what it was in the Q1 performance despite some of the cost in flu being overcome."]], ["3 billion of CapEx, I didn\u2019t see kind of an explicit rehalf of that just want to make sure that we were counting for any kind of tweaks there and is it based on conversion or absolute free cash flow?", ["So I just wanted to clear, what is the target for your incentive for this year in cash, I think the guide is 80% plus and then $1.3 billion of or up to $1."]], [" So how should we think about the installed base business trajectory relative to your WFE outlook?", ["Great, appreciate the insights there. And given the view on WFE being down kind of mid to high-teens this year, at the same time, the team had a strong shipment growth the last couple of years. You were driving \u2013 I was looking at it first half of last year, you guys were driving like 25% year-over-year shipment growth. Many of these tools are coming off warranty and on to service contracts this year. So this should be a tailwind for the team."]], [" Is there something going into the fourth quarter as it relates to some of the marketing initiatives that maybe would re-inflect that higher where you can maybe achieve something in the high single-digits or is mid single-digit volume growth sort of the right way to think about at least near-term where the volumes might be growing?", ["Okay. And then for my other question, looking at the US volume growth, it continues to be strong. But when you look at it on a two-year stack trend which we all do to try to get a sense of adjusting for prior year comps, it looks like it flatlined a little bit and implies maybe into the fourth quarter, you're starting to run more in the mid single-digits versus the high single-digits for US volume all-in."]], [" Does that start to help elevate the overall growth rate at some point versus the historical 6% to 7%?", ["Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, just first on the deconversion fees, you\u2019re sort of calling them out to be flat next year. To the extent that deconversion fees are sort of seemed to be on a decline to flat trend, I\u2019m assuming that means lower attrition in the business."]], [" If there are some of those going on, can you highlight priorities of investments back in the business?", [" And then I know sometimes you set priorities for investments across the business. Obviously that's a big portion of your cash flow to reinvest in the business. And sometimes, I know you guys have highlighted that certain areas of Optum or whatever are getting above-average investments."]], [" Is this laybacks at some of the mines and is it \u2013 when these are completed, will the unit costs come back down in North America? And then also, is there an opportunity to reopen the Miami mine?", ["Hi, everybody. Thanks. Just a quick question. In the North America operations, you're saying that the costs there were a little bit higher in the quarter because of higher mining rates. And, Richard, you kind of referenced this in your opening comments that you're mining more now relative to what you were doing when you were trying to cut costs."]], [" So can you talk through that organic top line deceleration a bit? And what's your expectation on comp store versus distribution growth?", ["Hey, guys. So I have an admittedly two-part question about your guidance. So first on top line, the back half of the year implies organic sales growth decelerating from, call it, 9% roughly now to below the 6% to 7% organic sales growth number."]], [" How are you thinking about the extended seasonal business here in the third quarter and how that might play out from a weather perspective?", [" And my follow-up question is, as you think about last year, July you saw nice inflection, you had an extended seasonal period partly driven by favorable weather. So, the quarter seemed sort of bookended by July and September with the hurricanes there."]], [" As you accelerate marketing spend, would you expect to see that in any operational metrics, like room nights or bookings or how would we see that flow into the model?", [" And then on the second question, on the EBITDA guidance, looks like you're keeping a 10% to 15%, but obviously, EBITDA is growing much faster in the first half, which is somewhat unusual."]], [" Can you help us think about where we should be resetting for standalone Invesco given current AUM levels?", ["Good morning. This is actually Ryan Bailey on behalf of Alex. I guess a question for Loren on the standalone Invesco expense base for 2019. So if we look at expenses for 2018 ex distribution looks like it's about $2.4 billion."]], [" So, how did you factor that one in when you think about 2020 in your comments around operating income growth in 2020?", [" And then the follow-up question to that is, when we think about all the changes that are coming up in U.S. healthcare, the proposed rebate rule on Part D, is a pretty significant one."]], [" But I guess, why not get more aggressive from a share repurchase perspective? Just how should we think about capital allocation going forward?", ["Okay. Perfect. Just want to clarify that. And then just a big-picture, I guess, question, just portfolio and capital allocation. I know you had mentioned just in terms of models need to take into consideration with the share count, no further share repurchase activity. You guys are in a pretty good position, obviously, from a share -- sorry, cash flow perspective, generating $20 billion this year. It sounds like your expectation is to pay out the opioid settlement."]], [" I\u2019m wondering if you could sort of just take what you told us a step further and maybe talk about the impact on efficiency as the revenue opportunities or that you mentioned that Chris was listing out, actually become more mature in '19? And also, what that means for the expense trajectory beyond this year?", ["I really appreciate some of the specifics that you laid out in terms of your investments spend. And you have kept your efficiency ratio stable at 57% and your guidance for 2018 is pretty clear. As we look to 2019 the street has a 58% efficiency ratio which is ahead of where you have posted over the past two quarters."]], [" I'm assuming that includes your joint venture with GGP in Seattle, but I was wondering if there were any other retail developments as part of this figure, and how many joint ventures you may have on densification effort?", ["Good morning. On your development rights, slide 11 of your presentation, you have a bar of $400 million, which includes asset densification in the West Coast."]], [" But given what we\u2019ve seen in the industry with Irma and the development with Irma, I mean can you give us a sense what kind of price increases would you need to see for this to be a successful renewal versus prices? If we get closer to 6/1 and prices fall short of expectations, is there a certain bar where Everest is going to walk away if they\u2019re not able to recoup price increases after 2 successive years of losses?", ["Hi good morning. My first question, I was hoping to spend a little bit more time on the forward pricing environment. I recognize we\u2019re still on discussions for the midyear renewals."]], [" How the board looks at your asset gathering capability relative to the other growth goals?", ["Okay, all right. Could be it, I'm calculating 45% off of this but I get it. So I guess the next question, the follow-up question would be for Karl. And I guess, since you are -- I guess, could you give us some insight into the board."]], [" How do you think about the cost of building this streaming business in terms of content spend or licensing loss relative to the opportunity down the road? Are you convinced that this sort of the upside is worth whatever dilution you expect to come?", [" And then on NBC, maybe for Steve or -- and/or Jeremy. I'm just curious, we saw the move of The Office from Netflix to NBC. We've seen shows like Chernobyl do really well."]], [" Is that related primarily or solely to sort of the price increases that come, what if they don\u2019t take the test part of the M2S subscription or are there kind of mix shifts going on there that perhaps higher priced guys tend to stay on maintenance as other guys are attriting? And is that trend line of increasing ARPS and maintenance, is that something that we should be looking to continue in our model?", ["Thank you, guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. Two questions. One relating to maintenance ARPS sort of taking the other side of the equation, you guys actually saw a nice increase there."]], [" But how has the pickup been among the SMBs, especially among the local advertisers? Do you think you can target that market without a sales force?", ["Okay. Sundar, just picking up on the AI for everyone theme, you\u2019ve been highlighting at I/O as well as other venues. Are conversations with advertisers suggest that products like smart bidding are becoming a pretty -- increasingly popular tool to add to their bidding strategies."]], [" Can you give us a sense though how those divested businesses had been tracking let\u2019s say over the full course of the year, have they been a significant weight on prior quarters as well or was this really an issue where performance really fell off quite abruptly in this quarter and then we didn\u2019t see a similar impact leading up to this?", ["Okay, great. And then quickly moving on to the commentary around dispositions in the 40 bps of organic growth impact. We understand the distraction issue as you go into negotiations and divestiture."]], ["\" I would argue that cost cuts are permanent than -- and these back-wardated [ph] power prices are hopefully temporary, but can you give us some confidence that there's positive operating leverage here as we move through time and that these lower commodity prices and capacity prices are not structural?", ["Great. Thanks. And one follow-up on Exgen and then one more if you let me, looking at the cost cuts, it's really quite an impressive, incremental change, you've got the costs declining from $4.65 billion to $4.175 billion in 2020 and a little bit more in 2021, $450 million savings, but that gross margins declined by $700 million. And so, skeptical investors look at this and say, \"Well, you guys are doing Yeoman's job here, right-sizing the cost structure, but earnings aren't getting better."]], [" And then maybe just as a follow-up, can you maybe talk about relative to the revenue synergies you expect to see over the five years post transaction close, which are the one or two items that you think you could see soonest in terms of either the cross-sell opportunities or the network side or the card processing side or just the pure cross-sell of acquiring services?", ["That's helpful. Thanks very much."]], [" I'm just trying to understand is that still the number that you expect the Midstream component of the business to give it back to you in terms of cash returns?", ["And a quick follow-up, guys. On the Analyst Day, one of the slides kind of highlighted that in 2019 and '20, you expect close to $1.9 billion in cash to be kicked back from the Midstream to the parent. Given the deal announcement today morning, I did my quick math, I was still coming very close to $1.9 billion."]], [" But is that right? And then big picture, can you reiterate the 17% margin guidance for this multi-year transition out of DSD for the Snacks segment?", ["Final question from me on DSD is your comments about second quarter \u2013 I apologize if I'm just getting this wrong, but Snacks sales were flat. I think you said there was 5 points of benefits from inventory sale to the customers but that promotions were down and that took volume down about the same amount. However, our Nielsen data says that revenue's down like 7%. So I'm just not clear on what we're expecting in the third quarter. I'm going to guess that third quarter will show a sizable negative because of the trends that we're seeing in Nielsen relative to flat second quarter sales."]], [" And then can you give me \u2013 give us, on the acquisition \u2013 excuse me, when you're saying the data center is expected to provide $200 million of revenue, $100 million of normalized EBITDA in 2018, what are you normalizing for?", ["Okay, and I'll work with that."]], [" More fully implementing the TCJA stuff over the balance of the year, can you give us a little guidance on what those figures will look like over the balance of this year? I mean, will they scale down considerably from the 50 plus million that we had in Q1?", ["Final one here, just kind of glancing over the cash flow statement, we still had a fairly nice cash flow benefit from deferred income tax in fiscal Q1, looks like 53 million versus 67 million last year."]], [" Just kind of remind us or as we look to the second half, are there a different set of puts and takes that we should keep in mind versus the first half on the EBIT front?", ["Thank you. Good morning. Just circling back on -- as you mentioned numerous times, 2018 is a year of investments for you guys, as you pull forward actions on labor and price and store remodels."]], [" Can you provide an update and maybe some greater context around those expectations?", ["Just following up on some of your comments around project deliveries. You've talked about an incremental $20 million of NOI from development and redevelopment projects in 2019."]], [" You had decent ratings for Battlefield V and maybe you could talk about what needs to change with marketing or is it just date selection, how are things going to evolve there?", ["Thank you very much and just a follow-up to Justin, he brought up some good points, how big of an issue do you see with marketing and significant changes need to be made here as you think about particularly marketing in the holiday quarter we saw you had issues several years back with Titanfall 2, despite the fact that was a good game from a ratings perspective."]], [" So some of that momentum sustainable for the business going forward?", [" If you think about this particular quarter, your gross margin was up 8 basis points to 36 basis points, 46 basis points, excluding the impact of that divestiture."]], [" And so, you kind of touched on it a little bit with the meal deals, but what do you attribute to a narrowing of outperformance versus quick service peers as Q2 did offer compelling value between $1 $2 $3 and the two for $4 breakfast sandwiches?", ["Great, thanks. You called out 90 basis points outperformance versus quick service peers versus a roughly, call it, 200 to 400 basis points level you had been running over the last five quarters."]], [" But what I really want to come back to is, this is about Aon, right?", ["And the final piece, I think to throw into this, Meyer, is the following. Listen, these conversations around pricing in this marketplace are obviously important and relevant, et cetera. We try to put them in context.

Thank you very much. Good morning."]], [" What the sensitivities are there?", [" And then may be specific comment on 4Q. The guidance range is wide there. Can you just maybe want to talk about what went to get to the lower end or the higher end of that guidance."]], [" So as we look into 4Q, I guess should we expect a potential acceleration into that $538 million and $542 million with some potential upside given those trends or is the Pillar headwinds enough of a sort of a headwind to keep you in the bottom of that range? And then also, just any audits of collection data feeds in the exchange data bucket this quarter?", ["Great. Thanks very much. Maybe just to finish up the look at market data into the fourth quarter. The $538 million to $542 million. Thanks for the comments on the connectivity desktop side. Maybe if you can also talk about the contribution of the stronger futures data to the exchange data line within data as we move into 4Q. Clearly, the pricing analytics is also growing or accelerating, as you said, Scott."]], [" So for first of all, am I kind of thinking about your guidance in the context of flash gross margin correctly and underneath that what assumptions are you making in terms of pricing and kind of cost down discussion as we go into the June quarter?", ["Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I can real quick. So, first of all -- just kind of thinking about how you rolled up to the guidance number that you've given, particularly around gross margin. Can you help us understand assuming that the Kuala Lumpur facility closure kind of keeps a positive trend on gross margin and also coupled with the commentary of the demand for the high capacity drives. If we were to assume hard disk drive gross margin kind of stays flattish here, it would appear like your flash gross margin looks to be maybe in that 17%, 18%, 19% range."]], [" So, I guess in light of those things, why did we not see more sequential improvement in operating margins in Hybrid IT?", ["Yes. Thank you. It sounded like you felt you had a lot of profit tailwinds in Hybrid IT segment this quarter, excellent execution on HPE Next, DRAM pricing environment, better structural price improvements and volume sequentially was up a couple hundred million on and also, your mix of tier 1 was down which should have helped."]], [" But is there a rule of thumb that you've seen from Delta over the years where if you say take out X number of points of ASMs, that loosely translates to X percentage points of headwind in the CASM-Ex side or is it really different every time?", [" And I realize that it depends on the type of capacity that's removed, that's gauged, and whatnot and maybe I'm just asking about sort of like variable and fixed costs at the end of the day."]], [" But I'm curious as to your view of the pace of the decay in the satellite business given that you need these cash flows to service debt and pay for phase one over the next couple of years?", ["Thanks. Two questions for Charlie and then probably one for Steve. I guess, Charlie, we all see the stock price. We sort of know what the market is pricing in in terms of your core business."]], [" And number 2, if those commission rates in your corporate services business stay higher than your rack, does that provide like an incentive for you to retain some more customers, have them transfer over, become E*TRADE customers, increase that 15% because there's almost like a natural incentive for them to switch over for the better commission pricing?", ["Sure. Sure. I get that, and that makes a lot of sense. And thanks for all that additional color. I really appreciate it. For my follow-up, it's my understanding that -- number 1, it's my understanding that in the corporate services business that the commission rates paid is sort of a dynamic that there's an interplay in between the platform fees and the commission rate paid and there's a sort of menu pricing that's available. And so that can result in commission per trade but skews away from your guys overall commission rates. And so since that's a menu pricing, the trading and the commission rates on your corporate services business wouldn't necessarily move with the rack rate. Number 1, I just want to confirm that, that's true."]], [" So is there anything that has changed, that made -- I mean, obviously, you had $80 million more than you originally anticipated, but how we should be thinking about the range that you gave us at the in terms of for investment?", ["I wanted to just cycle back to the synergies and the reinvestment; you had an amazing quarter in terms of flow-through, and it was above what you had initially indicated at the Analyst Day. I was just hoping to see how we should be seeing the cadence for 2018 and if this margin was just a catch-up because, obviously, the first 9 months you had a more challenging environment and you had to defend it. So for the full year, you used to had it like within that guidance."]], [" But in the first $500 million, just curious, is that driven the liquidity as you're seeing it? Is it driven by the way you see the price which you think is being undervalued?", ["I see. Second question, and as you laid out right now on the buyback front excluding the first $500 million. And if I heard you right, the second $500 million gets firmed up once the asset sale process starts to close as well."]], [" Are your yield assumptions for the next couple of years kind of still inside that normal what you guys would call a normal 2% to 4% yield range?", ["Okay got you. And then Richard or Jason, you gave a lot of good details about your new 20>25 program, but can you help us think a little bit about -- think about what some of your underlying assumptions are that go into that, and I guess what I mean is that you're basically assuming around kind of 14%ish earnings growth per year which is obviously very, very strong."]], [" First on TA, would you quantify the impact of timing dynamics on Q4 core growth for TA?", ["Good morning and thank you for taking my questions.

The insurance, so if you look at amounts that you can under recover versus your policies and that's how that impacts potential incremental equity needs and what you guys are assuming and your growth plan, you guys have around $800 million in liability insurance, $300 on for property. Your total expenses at roughly 1.1, part of those expenses may not be applicable to the property insurance. So there is a potential that you could under recover a little bit versus what you guys have access to. And then there are the arguments that the insurance companies can make from a defense standpoint."]], [" I wanted to see if you could give us the sense of just to understand is there a base operating income level that we should be considering for TNT, and you\u2019re adding 750 million on top of that or is 750 really kind of the bucket that you end up with at the end of fiscal 2020 in terms of operating income contribution? And then also I guess are you \u2013 the goodwill amortization, is that going to come in at some point or we should just consider that number I think you said like 115 a year, that\u2019s just kind of excluded from the way you look at TNT going forward?", ["Great. Thanks for all the color on the call and Alan in particular all the financial information around TNT is very helpful."]], [" And so just curious, as we think a bit out if there is upside to the $475 million or if you're going to continue to kind of reinvest in growth in other areas as you achieve these synergies if there is additional things that are found?", ["Thanks, good morning. I guess my first question is on just the synergies, the $475 million. Obviously, you've expressed a lot of confidence and have some good kind of runway to start here. So, Loren you mentioned also just kind of reinvestment back into the business."]], [" Where do you see that eventually bottoming out? When does the runoff from the deal that you've done?", [" You indicated it was down, I think, the runoff that is, down about 9%. You expect it to be less this year. It looks like your resi mortgages at the end of the year are just over $16 billion or 18% of total loans."]], [" Marty, just given what you've seen from Oasis thus far, what's been the reaction from clients with respect to the addition of that to your product portfolio? And I guess, more broadly speaking, heading into fiscal '20, do you feel kind of incrementally better or worse about the growth and that kind of the core payroll franchise revenue growth heading into next year?", ["Good morning, thanks for taking my question.

I'll ask both questions at the same time. First for you, Aart and then for, Trac. Aart, following up on the conversation we had when you were here in New York a couple of months ago, regarding the next big thing in EDA, you answered that prototyping, broadly speaking and new requirement and extraction would be the next growth driver for EDA.

Gross leverage, maybe 0.9 times EBITDA."]], [" How high do you think that could get?", [" I guess maybe a simple way of capturing it is, I think you've noted loyalty is 50% of the business now."]], [" So is that something that you're comfortable with or any sort of \u2013 just any additional color that you could share?", ["Good morning, Steve and Tim. Maybe taking the comments on fiscal 2018 and approaching it a little bit differently. So I realize that last year could have been an exception. But last year, at this point, you had offered 4% to 6% adjusted EPS growth for the following fiscal year with various headwinds at that time. And I \u2013 we appreciate the headwinds and tailwinds now, but some of those headwinds from last year seems to have abated. So this year, the Street is expecting about 8% earnings growth for next year ahead of your release this morning."]], [" And then just going off the STACK/SCOOP, several weeks prior to the announcement of the expansion on Canadian Valley you guys announced that you would be offloading 200 million cubic feet a day processing from that region to a third-party plants, could you explain why these volumes aren\u2019t being directed to the Canadian Valley plant, is it more of a timing thing, a geographical thing or anb economic decision?", ["Okay, great."]], [" How should we view that $50 million reduction? Is that just, you had pipeline fill at the end of the year in 2017 carried through into Q1 and you expect to normalize? Or how should we look at that?", ["Okay. Thanks. And then on the inventory and accounts receivable outlook for Ag & Turf, you had a big build in the quarter, you explained that. Now, you're also looking for $50 million reduction for the year despite the strengthening markets."]], [" Could you just talk about the progression of how you're seeing free cash flow conversion over the next maybe - towards the end of the decade?", [" That's the clarification. And then thinking about cash conversion, free cash flow conversion over the next couple of years, you've obviously got pension cash moving down. But then as we look out towards the end of the decade, you have - your FAS expense is going to come down."]], [" But should we start to expect with this kind of growth focus that the software and solutions category, roughly $500 million of revs would start to accelerate as a reflection of those investments?", ["Yes. Good morning. Just, Anders, could you maybe speak to, as we've kind of pivoted towards growth with the debt reduction here and our leverage ratio coming down, we kind of pivot towards growth.

And then, also, maybe if you can give us a little color on the underlying pieces, whether it's the digital growth rate expected to be BPS and Industry IP or the legacy would be great?", ["Thanks, Mike. Just when considering guidance, we're calculating around, I think, it's negative 1% constant currency organic for what's embedded in your outlook for the year revenues. I mean, it's clearly better than negative 3% or so constant currency last year, but just in the backdrop of what seems to be pretty good visibility you're seeing now and digital expertise and strong in your book-to-bill 1.1x."]], [" And my follow-up question is, as you look towards next year and you think about the algorithm that you laid out, will more of the margin expansion inherent your expectation of mid-single-digit operating income growth come from gross margins, like you've experienced in recent quarters due in part to the mix shift to both better categories and fulfillment options, or will it come from more SG&A leverage? And how should we think about the drivers between those two factors in the next couple of quarters?", ["That\u2019s helpful."]], [" So is it right to assume that this implies a lot of reinvestment in productivity? If so, kind of what shape, what form, and where?", ["First, I wanted to understand guidance and the implicit reinvestment into next year. I think you said around 5% to 7% bottom line, 2 points is share repo, getting us to a sort of 3% to 5% pre-tax on 3% growth. That doesn't imply much margin especially in context of I think you said, commodities post-tax only $200 million. That's kind of benign for a company your size."]], [" How does that kind of attract today?", ["Steve, just, now you've partially addressed this in a previous answer by one of the drill down a bit.

First, I noticed on the page 5 of the press release, you guys took out the $0.10 impact from the changing annual effective tax rate of 36 million there. But it looks like year-to-date, it was not taken out, it was left along so you got the 194 versus 184 if you just add up each quarter individually. Is that fair and then does that imply about $0.60 for 4Q for the full year guidance."]], [" Did that cost you on the operating expense front or is there something else going on there and what is the status of the pipeline expansion there?

If we have a challenging revenue environment, could you separate out an incentive comp of $10 million to $12 million? And also just on the incentive comp, maybe you could give us some color, what was the incentive comp for 2019? And how is that impacted by the outlook for revenue growth moving forward?", ["I wanted to dig a little bit on the 2020 expense outlook. The 4% to 5% core expense growth, I'm assuming the main factors there are the continued data buildout, the sales buildout."]], [" For Devinder, I think it\u2019s impressive that the cash that you generated 10 years ago, you were $4 billion in net debt and now you are net cash positive, I didn\u2019t think back then we would expect you to be here, but how should we think about capital structure going forward and for the $440 million in cash flow from operations could \u2013 I had a challenge reconciling it? Can you share the biggest two or three sources of cash? And then for Lisa, the last time AMD had a product cycle in servers, I think you were gaining \u2013 once you hit 5% share, you started to gain share at 2% or 3% or 4%, 400 basis point clip per quarter, how should \u2013 what is the right kind of cadence or pace of share gains in servers this cycle and maybe you could just talk about structurally what gives your ability to \u2013 or the pace of your ability to gain share?

Scot Ciccarelli. I guess I have a bigger picture question for you guys. So historically, this industry kind of viewed a sweet spot for cars entering their initial repair stage at maybe 6 to 8 years old for the pro side of the business.

Patricia, two quick follow-ups for you just to clean up a couple of items. On the tax reform, so you're saying that some of the tax reform benefit was reinvested back into brand building.

And what do you think the first-mover advantages are in these technology-related investments? Like how much can you keep do you think relative to your competition?", ["Okay, got it. And so I guess by implication and that means that you\u2019re probably going to be at the lower end of your margin expected range for the year, excluding the hurricanes, I guess would be the implication from that.

Speaking of patterns, turning the clock back even further, when you compare what we just went through in 2007, 2008, to the 1990 banking debacle, that debacle, as we all recall, was pretty severe and we had a great recovery coming out of 1990.

Why would not that be the case?", ["Okay. Thanks for getting me in here.

So going back for the $700 million to $900 million that you are selling with a cap rate of 7.5% to 8%. If we go beyond that and just think about how the balance of the portfolio is, is there another sizable chunk of assets that you would say, the cap rate is 6.5% to 7%, and we should think of it as ratably getting better or is there -- once this chunk of the portfolio is gone, a notable step-up in terms of the quality and a drop in the cap rate."]], [" There we're hearing about some initial signs of a pickup from a number of CPG companies and the macro indicators generally seem favorable, so are you seeing category growth recover in emerging markets in general and are you comfortable that that builds as we look out to Q4 and 2018?", ["So I was hoping to get more of a review of category growth around the world besides some of the commentary that John made. First, in the U.S., you did mention a slight pickup sequentially in category growth, but we're still seeing pretty weak year-over-year trends in terms of category growth. And that doesn't seem to fit with macro indicators that theoretically should be favorable for the consumer. So I'd love to get your view on what's driving the U.S. category weakness, and if you think it's more temporary or longer term and if this slight pickup you've seen continues going forward.

Good morning, fellows. So you talked about $225 million of synergies originally with this deal, and $175 million of it was on the revenue side. So to look at this commentary about CASMex flat to down in 2019 and 2020. And you said you're going to get a couple hundred million dollars in revenue - in synergies, I think you said this year. And given that 1 point of RASM is only about $70 million, I guess, that implies that we could be sort of leaving 2018 given the deceleration in capacity, on a pretty strong trajectory on RASM if you are, in fact, capturing majority of those synergies on the revenue side, as you laid out in the presentation."]], [" And just given the quarter and DCB within that 5% to 6% range, should we be thinking toward the lower half of that range?", ["Just two for me, one on revenue and one on currency. Just if you could just -- starting with revenue for a second, our sense is the DCB update probably reflects a 50% reduction in that business in the back half.

And also, did you see any escalation in your CapEx costs and your expected manufacturing cost here?", ["Thank you. And then, as a follow-up. I'm just trying to understand the magnitude of CapEx in 2018. If I look at overall Albemarle CapEx, it's rising about $500 million in 2018.

Incrementally, is it getting to find?", ["Thanks. Good morning. My question is on the operating profit outlook. So it\u2019s mentioned in the release, you have the $60 million headwind from profit share, and then there\u2019s just natural cost creep. I played with some numbers.

But, kind of in the market that we expect, not necessarily red hot from an activity standpoint but still tight and pricing still accommodating your utilization, you said that there is runway for improvement."]], [" I was just curious if you could just bridge the outperformance in what you think the primary reasons were?

Brad, the Consumer business you started 7% to 9% guidance. You are ending the loan to that almost doubled."]], [" How are your views changing on where Pulte's mix should be going forward from a segmentation standpoint?", ["Got it, okay. The second question is really a bit more high level. I think the Pulte, in the recent past has been maybe more balanced than peers in terms of thinking about kind of the broader customer segmentation in terms of entry level versus move up. There's a popular belief out there today that entry level or first time is still the relatively strong part of the market and where people want to shift to. Your own trend suggest a little bit different. I know you pointed out a couple of reasons why you may be different than some of your peers there, but I'm curious more on a high level. If we think about affordability as becoming more challenging. And that buyer -- almost by definition, the marginal buyer being most impacted by affordability."]], [" So my question is when adjusting for market factors and whatever else you may deem appropriate, are you still comfortable with the 11% return on capital employed and $25 billion annual earnings figures for 2020? And if so, what factors will help bridge the gap from the first half 2019 actuals to the full year 2020 projections? Or do you think we'll get there solely from normalization of the market factors that Neil mentioned on page 9 in his opening comments?", ["Hi, everybody. Neil financial results in the first half of 2019 seem to be tracking below the plan highlighted at Analyst Day for 2020.

So just a broader question on the biologics market structure and maybe as it relates to your biosimilar business. So we were reading a white paper that I think you guys put out recently on the biosimilar market. I think you guys highlight a real problem. Even under a hypothetical scenario, I think your paper talked about how where a biosimilar is priced at, say, a 25% discount to the innovator, you still have a patient copay that's still higher than the innovative drug. I think in your paper it said almost 40% higher under Medicare Part D. So just curious, you guys seem as close as anyone to policy makers and directions to where this may go, and I know you devoted a great deal of time and energy towards your biosimilar business. I assume that there's an expectation here that some of these disincentives will go away."]], [" So, how you do all that, the modernization to build out the expansion, and then also keep expenses flat for two years?", ["Hi.

And then on free cash flow, so you\u2019re up about $100 million through the first half of the year versus last year.

The first one is bigger picture on the cost-savings programs, the various programs, and just your sense today of the delivery of those savings to the EBIT line versus the need to reinvest in the market. As you said in your script, the number one point is getting that sales growth.

I believe there is $250 million remaining in your program."]], [" How should we think about the breakout between the two for the end of the year?", ["Well, thanks. If we look at your first half performance, I think the organic growth was around about 4% and I think you're saying -- you said early this year expect something like 3% organic for full-year. There is quite a disparity between the U.S kind of 0 to 1 and the rest of the world very high single digits. I heard your comments have hopefully U.S in those specific areas improving by Q4, and I think you said Europe remains quite strong.

I understand why you might not want to provide a formal update to top line guidance given we're only two weeks into the second quarter and only around three months into the year. And that's said, I haven't heard anything coming off of a strong Q1 that would suggest there's any change in positive trend or that there were any transitory issues that made Q1 uniquely strong.

I just want to make sure I understand sort of what the moving parts with the fuel tax credit this week and kind of get that out of the way. So in the second quarter I think you guys have been expecting an 80 basis point headwind that ended up coming in a bit bigger than that.

Just looking at the guidance, this quarter you bought back just under $370 million of stock and in the back half of the year that should be a pretty nice help to you just given the lower share count from that.

You beat consensus this quarter, I know that\u2019s not necessarily your internal target, but let\u2019s just say you beat by at least a couple of cents there, and then obviously you mentioned the higher interest, so maybe $0.02 from that as an offset, but basically a $0."]], [" But, as you sort of start through that prioritization process, how often are you going in and creating a new application that didn't exist before, versus replacing legacy off the shelf software versus custom app development or replacing legacy custom applications?

But the average market performance impact was not that significant and we are to be getting that on more of a lagged basis as we work through the rest of the year.

So it's about an $18 million and $20 million decline. So, the question is very simple. I'm just trying to understand whether there is any one-offs or factors that would explain why there was an EBITDA growth in the quarter when you are supposed to have these cost savings coming through. I mean, obviously your shipments were down 4%, so that explains part of the fact, the issue. Your pricing apparently was not enough to cover the higher costs, right.

Would that change if most of the sand is regionally sourced?", ["Thank you. And Dave congratulation again and you'll be certainly missed and your comments would be missed greatly on the calls. My question relates to the Permian sand that's been recently got FERC's, a new capacity additions have been announced and there is good chance that prices are going to fall quietly sharply in the Permian for EMP companies there."]], [" Can you just share what you're seeing in that business? Am I correct that that would be a little bit of a year-over-year revenue decline for CSRA?", ["So the CSRA contribution of about $3.6 billion, it looks like that would be down a bit versus what CSRA did in the comparable period, the three-quarter period in the prior year. And they've been guiding to organic growth, plus they have a couple small deals in there."]], [" And if you intend to change your pace of investment activity in the breakout opportunities this year ahead versus earlier years?", ["Hi, thanks. Good morning. Your pace of M&A activity has picked up in recent quarters, particularly with the acquisition of Genscape. When you had a similar level of M&A activity in 2018, EBITDA margins did contract by about 100 bps. So diving deeper into margins in the year ahead, can you discuss how the margin profile Genscape compares to your earlier acquisitions particularly ones being integrated in 2018."]], [" Can you tell us whether you do think that's going to be a significant growth driver for 2019?

Secondly, can you talk about Dupixent outlook? Do you believe the asthma indication will start to be a more important growth driver versus atopic dermatitis for 2019?", ["Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. First question on EYLEA, obviously you're waiting for FDA approval in diabetic retinopathy."]], [" Just to clarify, is that just a pull forward from the total run rate of synergies or is that an additional increase in synergies for what you think you\u2019re getting out of Heartland, and maybe what is causing the pull forward?", ["Okay, terrific. And just a quick follow-up, on the synergies from Heartland, I think you guys increased those $10 million for this fiscal year."]], [" So I guess I'm just trying to parse through, are you more bullish because of maybe some risk to EUV or are you bullish about the wafer capacity addition that you see on the NAND side next year?", ["Thanks a lot. Gary, I wanted to follow up on the WFE share comment. By my math, you sort of peaked at close to 22% in 2016. It was pretty flat in 2017. And you lost about 200 basis points last year. In that same time ASML gained about 400 basis points worth of share and it sounded in the prepared remarks like you're a little more optimistic about gaining WFE share next year and I guess, that's in a year where it seems like the industry has to come up with at least a couple of billion dollars year-over-year for EUV."]], [" And what strikes me, I think a lot of people from the slides and again going back to Slide #8, which is very, very helpful?", ["Thanks.

And can you tell us exactly what the gain was, the amount of the gains in the fourth quarter?", ["So just going back to the materials and other line item, forgetting for now -- I just want to be clear, forgetting for now the fourth quarter 2018 impact.

I believe Rich mentioned in his prepared remarks an ability to invest $2 billion to $3 billion a year on an ongoing basis."]], [" So when does that IRP going to come out and how do we think about what that means in terms of sort of post -- sort of early to mid to late 2020 capital spending?", ["Got you. Okay, as regard -- with regard to the IRP, you talked about how you're going to give us a little bit more of a sense how you get to your 80% carbon reduction by 2050.

Okay, fair enough, the second question on the overall health of the consumer, you talked about moving up your loss ratios from 470 million to 500 million and the longer-term changing, we are seeing increases in losses in an environment where you do have a very strong labor market, unemployment coming down.

You'd still expect $200 million to $300 million in 2020.

We can go into detail offline. And lastly, the comment you had about second half operating margins being similar to the first quarter. To hit your EPS number, it seems to be implying the back half of the year, the sales growth is roughly 13%.

Steve, just a quick question for you on Gulf Coast Express; when we put all the pieces of the puzzle together, of the 1.7 that's being marketed, inclusive of the reside gas that DCP could commit, and we can all see what that is, and the options both upstream and downstream at the pipe that you talked about."]], [" Beyond the $300 million here, how active is the pipeline beyond that?

You got it from lower NII growth this year. Investors don't necessarily like that. So I guess, I'm asking you this environment with lower interest rates.

And I know there's an analogy, hey, we're going to be going to dermatologists the same way we go to veterinarians and to dentists. But at the same time, I mean, a lot of us has been to Topeka. We've been to New Jersey. We've seen your huge R&D facilities.

So Joe, the 2019 adjusted operational growth of 2% to 3% was a little below what we expected based on your public comments in Q4. So I want to understand the component. It sounds like you expect Consumer to accelerate or at least stay consistent with 2018 in 2019, and you expect Med Tech to accelerate versus 2018. So the implication is that Pharma is going to be about 2% at the midpoint in 2019, which is slightly below the market growth of, I think, 3% to 4% you said you could achieve in 2019 during your public comments in Q4."]], [" Was that line specifically to suggest that what we've seen these last few quarters relative to your guidance is less of an indicator of how we should think about Q3?", [" And then, David, you mentioned that your approach to guidance hasn't changed.

I guess let me push back a little bit and say that I think that pretty much everyone that bought the stock from early December, when Neel was at a conference talking about a comfort level in the low 70s payout ratio range bought the stock because of the dividend. And now that you've cut the dividend, you're going to create an incremental billion dollars of cash flow per year, over a three-year timeframe that's $6 billion of cash flow but you only have $3.6 billion of debt over that timeframe maturing all of which trades above par, all of which has a yield that's several 100 basis points below where the new equity yield is going to be."]], [" Just curios for the back half of the year how much climbing inflation could move EPS, was really what the question is?", ["So another question from me and coming back to the commodity spot pricing and timing etc. it sounds like you're really not raising the guidance today for that metric.

But you know - as coming back to our discussion around this last quarter as you guys mentioned it's hard to calculate the overall inflation, but you do have the example in the 10-K that again the hypothetical 10% increase in key commodity inputs will be about $0.10 hit to overall EPS. So now some of these trends are softening in your favor, you mentioned the data points and everything else. I guess I'm just curios within the current guidance range, could less commodity inflation risk still be EPS driver into the magnitude of $0.10 plus within the guidance range."]], [" I guess I want to sort of follow on with that line of thinking, Mark, and this uptick in fiscal 2020 and you talked a lot about your Cloud Apps and we get a lot of information on that but can you talk a little bit about what extent the data base options might be a driver to some of that revenue acceleration and how big is the Middleware business at this point?", ["Thank you.

First, if you pull the data from ENGAGE and EMERGE, would the pooled results still be positive on the primary endpoint and kind of related to that, could you give us some sense of what the differences between ENGAGE and EMERGE were in exposures at those high doses.

That obviously drove the upside of the quarter, this quarter, sort of the $0.08 that you sort of called out, meaning the deconversion fees, I'm pretty sure, and I think you acknowledged, came in higher than you would have thought in the quarter, and then you got the benefit from the tax rate in the quarter."]], [" So when should we expect the logic segment of your business to pick up meaningfully from a shipment and revenue perspective?", ["Okay. Great. And then I had a follow up on the logic business. I was a little bit surprised how low system shipments were in Q1 or the March quarter.

And then on -- two more questions, one on the regulated side, the ComEd sounds like it's operating very well but 30-year is a headwind and it'll continue to be a headwind into next year and until we see a steepening of the yield curve. So like -- as you're looking at the outcomes in the other areas of the utility business."]], [" Just at a high level, how did the organization come to that decision under new leadership?

And then when you announced this maybe win about a month ago sort of made one come to the realization that actually about $50 million piece of that $300 million, if the IDIQ conversion holds, now is itself tripling and so why, I guess, is that true of that maybe piece of that business?

Okay. And then just following up on the tariff impact question. So if I look at the slide where you talk about the gross margin impact from tariff to 0.3%, so that\u2019s about $3 million roughly in terms of the second quarter. It sounds like the $35 million to $40 million impact that you called out last quarter is still intact."]], [" So if you agree with the premise of everything I just set up, there does appear to be some difference in what you were guiding to in terms of what you are seeing right now, what would cause that?", ["Appreciate all the details. I want to come back to the question of performance relative to guidance, if we \u2013 and let's take it from a prior, pre-Diversey being discontinued operations basis, which will then get away from that accounting as you were talking about, Jerome. So I think prior guidance you were looking for about a $1.180 billion in EBITDA and if I talk the $825 million of continuing operations and I gross up the $215 million for full year, I'll wind up at around $1.150 billion. We also have currency which seems like it's been less negative, which is a good thing and volume trends have been at least as good it would appear as you would have been expecting."]], [" And so how do you think about that in the context of what you can control and what you can\u2019t control and how you expect some of the smaller peers, I guess, to sort of play out over the next couple of years?", ["So, two things, so, one, as we think about sort of in the rest of retail, a lot of the sort of fears that existed and what companies ultimately have done and I\u2019m thinking about Walmart and Home Depot and some of the more traditional guys, they have basically pursued one sort of omni-channel approach and I think you guys have talked a lot about technology and investment today. But two, there\u2019s just been in general a big downsizing of boxes in a lot of different areas and sort of a consolidation in the industry. That\u2019s the one thing that\u2019s sort of lacking here, obviously, you guys are closing more stores than what we saw in the past. But how do you think about sort of the state of pharmacy and the competitive landscape, because if we think about what\u2019s driving possibly some of the reimbursement pressure outside of lower brand, some of it is still the fact that we\u2019re over boxed across the U.S., maybe by a substantial amount."]], [" So I guess my question is, do you think Kraft Heinz with its sort of geographic portfolio and relative market share makeup, should be able to sustain a margin structure still well above the Group or not?", ["Thanks for that. And I know you're not ready to address, obviously, what you see is sort of a more sustainable margin structure for the business yet, going forward. But as you mentioned, EBITDA margins have sort of come in some 500 basis points or so in the past three years. Some of that's been reinvestment, whether in marketing or capabilities, and some has been related to other items, but margins are still well above the Group average."]], [" What's the strategy for the copper getting the speeds up to have a competitive broadband product there where you may not be planning to roll fiber right now?

And so if we take the 1% to 2% organic forecast for '18, I am trying to get a sense of whether this is just as you stated, not being certain about how sustainable that better category growth is or is it suggesting that you see continued market share or losses as we move through '18.

I guess as we look at the trends of your sales, recognizing that on a longer term basis the onsite stuff does start to even out a little bit, but the mix is still running negative, so you have in the past said you have to look to backfill something like 20 to 30 basis points to just keep your gross margin flat due to mix."]], [" Is that correct?", [" And just to follow up on that, I just want to confirm that when you do give full year guidance you don't plan on including any buybacks in the EPS."]], [" Is there anything else you can share on your learnings at this \u2013 of the initiatives at this very early stage?

Obviously, which is a good thing, the stock has gone up, you've been fairly aggressive in buying back stock. But to buyback the entire 60 million shares will cost you a little over $500 million more than you had budgeted, at least I think you budgeted.

Right now we're talking about $8 billion dividend, which gets me to something like an 88% payout ratio this year at the high end of guidance.

You delivered 80 basis points of underlying margin in Q4 and 20 basis points for the full fiscal year and you are guiding to 50 for 2019. So I was wondering if you could just talk about the 80 basis points of underlying improvement in Q4, which was a little shy of what you were hoping for at the 100 basis points you talked about.

I expect the total 100% spending for the smelter come through on your cash flow statement."]], [" Does that make you ultimately run faster on the treadmill because you had to put people at work? Is that part of that decision making process?", [" And one of the factors I was thinking about and as a fact that maybe have a deep personnel bench development team."]], [" Can you confirm that all cash costs associated with the Jarden synergies are included in that? Second question would be, is there any working capital benefit?", ["A few questions there."]], [" As I think about this the sub-2% CASM-Ex number next year and the 3% capacity guide, how sensitive is that CASM-Ex number to that 3%?", ["Okay, thanks. And then another one for you, Paul."]], [" So what opportunities have you found to drive down costs so far and what opportunities do you see going forward to further cut cost out of the system and improve returns there?", [" And then the second part of the question is stepping back, as you think about this transition to plug and perf and how it's gone relative to the expectations, it seems like the results have been beating at least the guidance that you laid out at the Investor Day last year, particularly on cost side."]], [" Could you maybe walk us through how you are able to offset some of the reactivation costs? And then to what extent will reactivation cost impact the third quarter? And do you intend to reactive any more equipment or is it more refers or new build at this point?", ["Thank you. Good morning. Great and first let me say it, Dave, congratulation on a great career, CEO of Halliburton. I enjoyed working with you last several years. Okay, thanks. First question, I wanted to just circle back on the impact of reactivation in 2Q and how to think about any impact on our third quarter. It was talked about in terms of impacting, negative impacting margins on your first quarter call. You still had incrementals in CMP close to 50%."]], [" So, I was hoping you could provide some color into how your customer conversations have evolved over the last year?", [" And then, if I could push you one more time on Optical, normalizing your 2019 Optical revenue outlook for the 3M acquisition and the $100 million impact from the single FTTH customer, organic growth appears to be decelerating to 8%. I know this is much higher than market, but this was a business that was organically growing well into the double digits."]], ["50% plus as a more normal margin range, once we get beyond this liquidity impact? And then second, are there any other levers, particularly on the funding side, you could have to drive this back closer to that historical range?", ["So I wanted to start off with a question on the net interest margin. So it had been running in the, call it, 15.75% to 16% range since you went public and deployed all your liquidity. Now just to think about the moving pieces, you're saying 15% for the first quarter, which means you need to be 15.5% plus for the rest of the year to reach the middle of the guide. So I know it's hard to forecast very far out given all the moving pieces, but should we think about 15."]], [" So, other than maybe contingent commissions or a couple of other minor \u2013 are there any major drivers there that, that would have resulted in this significant improvement quarter-to-quarter?", ["Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I guess this question is a multi-part question. So, first, just looking at the total reinsurance underlying attritional combined ratio of 87.4%, it just seems a little bit lower than the roughly 87% number that I think we had run rated last quarter."]], [" I\u2019m just trying to get an idea of kind of how you all thinking about the trade-off of when you want to build out your own infrastructure versus kind of bringing partners in for either a portion or all of the project, either for financial reasons or just to accelerate the buildout?", ["Obviously, the vertical integration and the big infrastructure footprint that you have guided and continue expanding has been definitely distinct advantage. And I know that right now, you are just sort of running that $300 million infrastructure spend, basically constant in the model in the next several years."]], [" So trying to understand exactly where the buybacks fit on a priority scale? Would you be willing to increase bid dispositions further to fund it, and kind of what it means for your long term goals of getting a rating upgrade?", ["Okay. And then, in terms of the buyback, you obviously have a pretty full pipeline of spend here, nearly $500 million of redevelopment, $100 million of maturities and amortization. I think you took care of some of that already so far this year. You have also talked about delevering further with proceeds."]], [" So, is that another reason maybe to feel good about, getting that GDP growth as it maybe you\u2019re seeking through some of that and some of your customers on the commercial side or point down their excess liquidity and then they\u2019ll turn to drawing back on their lines later in the year?", [" But maybe there is actually some use and then take down of those deposits before drawing a line."]], [" And so, I just want to get a sense of how much of this is just layering in NGINX versus how much of this is kind of -- is there a cost to kind of the change in go-to-market approach?", ["Great. This is Meta Marshall for James. Maybe first question, understanding that the 33% to 35% OpEx is kind of within the Horizon 1 that you had noted, but just also you kind of noted that change to the go-to-market."]], [" So, why then have you not \u2013 if you're taking at a more measured pace going forward, why are you actually not raising the EBIT margin degradation number or lowering it, I should say? Why is it not a narrower EBIT margin loss?", ["Thank you. It's Alan with BTIG. Tom, you had said that you will continue to optimize your inventory at a more measured pace. And I believe in the past, that was a significant contributing factor in your EBIT margin degradation of 200 basis points to 300 basis points for the year."]], [" So should I assume that repricing and the expenses just get another $50 million in pickup over the course of the next year? Or is there more than that? Do we get closer to the 7%?", ["Just kind of following up on the group. You had a pretax -- an after-tax margin of 4.8% versus the guided 5% to 7%. And if I took the midpoint of that 5% to 7%, that would imply close to $50 million of additional earnings pickup probably due to the repricing and the expense savings on the Liberty acquisition. So I think, Randy, you mentioned another $20-or-so million coming on the expense side. I think Dennis was talking a little bit about continued benefits from repricing."]], [" As we look out for the remainder of the year, is this something that is sustainable?", ["Yes. As I look at the strategic product growth area, you exited FY 2016, I think it was a 21% rate and you put up Q1 here at about a 26% rate. So that acceleration, obviously terrific execution."]], [" Can you give us a sense \u2013 in the nature of maybe $50 million, $60 million, can you give us a sense of how much more do you anticipate over the next two years?", ["Okay. And then just sticking to RIDEA, the revenue-enhancing CapEx that you budgeted for this year, it seems like that you've been \u2013 they've been investments now for probably four years if I'm not wrong."]], [" A little more detail there, if possible?", [" And then just lastly if I could sneak a clarifying question as well. Don, you mentioned the tax rate impacting 3Q, 4Q results."]], [" Can you talk about in areas where you are winning kind of where you are differentiating versus the competition? And then as part of that I know the company has talked about kind of leveraging the core connector technology with sensors, and what type of traction you're seeing that as a go-to-market with auto OEMs?", ["Thanks. Sorry, there was some line issues, so Terrence just the question on the sensor wins you called out, $800 million in fiscal 2018."]], [" Luca, could you talk a bit more about the capital allocation? The dividend increase of 16% was relatively low relative to what you could have done, so are you really thinking the stock price is attractive here?", ["Great. Thank you."]], ["1 million wafers products per month and relatively flattish for the past several years, the market has been getting nervous in the amount of announced DRAM CapEx spend announcement of new fiber expansion product or projects, but a lot of it I think is just to offset capacity declines and technology conversion and just to maintain a stable bit supply output, so wanted to get your views on how much you see total industry capacity going this year?", ["Well, good afternoon and great job on the quarter of the execution. As a follow-up to the prior questions on DRAM, maybe a different way of asking the question is to see if the team can help us quantify some of the reviews, overall DRAM industry capacity has been trending about 1."]], [" Can you just update us on how successful you are with that initiative? And also, can you just comment on backlogs occurring specific to North America? And how are you kind of managing production for next year just given the surge in demand?", ["Okay. That's really helpful. And then last quarter, Dan, I apologize if I -- if you talked about this, but you said that you would leverage Q4 to basically rebuild inventory levels in North America for 2020 just to give your operations a bit of breathing room."]], [" To what extent is that at play here in these numbers?", [" And kind of number two, you've referred to concessions generally, and I know they've been a factor in New York."]], [" So I was just hoping you could review if you are comfortable on the 2% pricing range going forward for your business and anything you\u2019re seeing from a competitive standpoint in the industry?", ["Okay, that's helpful. And then beer pricing was strong in the quarter at 3%, obviously part of that is balanced mix, but still strong on an underlying basis at a time when industry discounting looks like it\u2019s picked up."]], [" Are these new renewals, or are these the same renewals rolling through until they come, and is it safe to assume that the new base then grows and its new enterprise wins also ramp, so the GFS organic constant-currency growth rate should improve from here?", [" You had mentioned large renewals having an impact last quarter as well."]], [" And you talked a bit about the various tradeoffs in your opening remarks, but is there a specific commitment you're thinking about or a roll-off of infrastructure spending or anything that will be driving CapEx materially lower next year?", ["Good morning. First question coming back to capital spending, this year you're at $3.9 billion, which is towards the upper end of the range you had talked about previously of the $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. Obviously, there's accelerating production growth that comes with that. But I guess I'm kind of wondering as we look ahead, Vicki, you've talked about a commitment to have a meaningful step down in CapEx in 2019 on the back of hitting the breakeven. So just want to get your latest thoughts on that."]], [" Can you give us an indication of likely timing that you're looking at? And are you looking at mainly tied to financial bias?", [" I'm just interested particularly in extent to which of those cost reductions can continue into FY 2020. And then on News America Marketing, you've given us a brief update on the sale process."]], [" What are you thinking about further infusions from Industrial to Capital in 2020? And also, any framing you can give the commentary around lower Capital earnings this year?", ["Hi. And maybe a question on Capital for a change. So, Jamie, I heard your comments around the leverage level likely rising through this year. You had the $2.5 billion capital infusion in Q4."]], [" Did you say what operating profit was excluding Brakes?", ["Hi. Good morning. It's Ryan Gilligan on for Karen. And thanks for taking the question."]], [" But, can you give us kind of more detail on how you see SG&A and R&D evolving over time?", ["I have a question on spending infrastructure over the long-term. So, naturally, the big concern is HUMIRA biosimilars and how that impacts the P&L. And one of the levers you could potentially pull is cutting cost some point in the future. And I know you've given long-term operating margin guidance."]], ["2 billion, which is your current cash flow?", ["Great, great. And just to clarify your comments on CapEx, you mentioned that CapEx would likely trend higher. You'll update the Street in the middle part of the year. But you did mention that while it could be higher than $2.9 billion, did you mention that it could be less than $3."]], [" Is this any hidden cost in that that's why that Anadarko willing to sell at such a cheap price? I am trying to understand that is there any other thing that we need to consider when we are looking at those numbers?", ["Okay. A quick follow-up, actually, no follow-up but a question on Alaska, the bolt-on acquisition if I look at the price you pay it seems like you pay for about $29,000 for daily bill of production capacity or maybe about $9 per barrel of the recovered book barrel if we are using 200 million gross. Those seems very low number."]], [" So, I just wanted to see \u2013 is that the correct way to think about Tools segment incremental margins as we go into the fourth quarter and just what does that imply with where you are in price/cost at that point in time in the segment?", ["Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask you about the seasonality of earnings. It looks like to hit the fourth quarter implied guidance range, your Tools segment incremental margins \u2013 look like they would have to get back to or better than what you typically see in the mid 20% range."]], [" I appreciate the system make-up has changed a little bit with Aruba and the crude toppers, but if you saw an environment with wider heavy dips over the next couple years, could you run more incremental heavies through your Gulf Coast system?", ["Maybe to stick on this heavy sour theme, I think, Joe, in your opening comments, you talked about how you maximized heavy sour crude runs in the quarter. If I look at the data, your Gulf Coast system ran approximately 36% heavy plus resid in Q2. And then if we look way, way back to 2006, you ran approximately 51% heavy crude plus resid."]], [" Can you give us any sense of the opportunities from here over the course of the next year in terms of how much more you can do in driving margin upside as well as of WatchGuard and Avigilon in terms of how far how fast that revenue can grow?", ["I appreciate that. I might have two questions. One is a broad question, I apologize, visiting a number of questions earlier in the call. And then a specific question, the broad question is to the extent that video hardware analytics and monitoring along with margins have been the two or I think certainly are two of the key upside opportunities and focuses for the Company."]], [" So I'm just trying to understand maybe some of the moving pieces there, and if you have any color about where the EOR cost is given the higher oil price et cetera?", ["Okay. Got it. And then my second question is around the OpEx for the U.S. The guidance of $12.50 a barrel. It's a little bit higher than my model, not hugely so, but given that the incremental \u2013 the resources barrels are coming on I think at $2 to $3 per barrel that you've talked about in the past. And I think 4Q ended sub-$8 a barrel."]], [" What's the population density threshold that you're using to define what sites fall into that bucket? And I understand it's a small share of your business, have you actually observed any impact on new leasing due to small cells on those 1% of sites or rooftops you might manage in those areas?", ["Okay, that's helpful. And then Jim, in your prepared remarks, you noted that I think you said less than 1% of your U.S. sites are in locations with population density sufficient to support out to small cells. So that was a really interesting statistic, I know it's pretty specific."]], [" Based on your contracts, how exposed are you to market inflation risk relative to what you have in the slide? And can you also talk a little bit more about the drivers of the design and efficiency improvements and the risk there to the upside and the downside?", ["As we think about the path to achieving that $50 breakeven, I wanted to just focus a bit more on your expectation to reduce well costs in the Delaware, in particular, which I think you have on slide 53."]], [" Or do you think, you will sustain some of that improvement?", ["Good morning. Jim, just maybe starting on flows, you had highlighted that the U.S. is seemingly having better traction here, but still some headwinds in EMEA, and it does look like though for the last couple of quarters we've been selected to a better level on flows, do you think we're going to sustain some of the improvement here for a while or when you consider what's going on in Europe, is there more of a chance that will revert to kind of that $6 billion to $8 billion of outflow quarterly level that you had been running at going back a year."]], [" Was there much impact from the Netflix promotion?", [" So that's number one. And then number two, just some follow-up on ARPU."]], [" And I\u2019m wondering if you guys already seeing that in your marketplace that\u2019s helping the scatter number?", [" And then, [indiscernible] and scatter, I\u2019m fascinated by the 40% higher rate. And one of the things we\u2019re seeing in Priceline and Expedia which do $5 billion each year in search engine marketing is they are pulling money out of that Google Search Engine and they are putting it on TV."]], [" How are you guys thinking about integrating those programs to really help drive traffic? And is there a time this year that we should expect to see that maybe enhance or roll out?", ["And then a bigger picture question, you talked a lot about traffic. But I don't think we've test yet on the loyalty programs and the frequency you could drive from Red Card and Cart wheel. And it\u2019s been a lot of change in the market, whether it's Amazon Prime or Costco with their new Credit card or Walmart with free shipping thresholds lowering."]], [" And then if we sort of disaggregate the Merchant Solutions business, to the extent we can by Legacy Global and TSYS is the right way to think about it, that Legacy Global grew in the low double-digits and TSYS sort of in the mid-single-digits?", ["Hey, thanks for squeezing me in guys and appreciate all the color. Maybe just two points of clarification if we look at the fourth quarter 2019 performance, firstly on a year-over-year pro forma basis, was the growth rate roughly 7% and then you're talking about the 7% accelerating to 8% to 9% in 2020."]], [" But would we anticipate, John, that gross profit would also be growing specifically in North American distribution?", ["Just to go back and follow-up on the Distribution Solutions operating margin. If I look back in the guidance you guys provided, I mean, if I think back to October when you guys lowered guidance on competitive pressures and in the moderating inflation. And I think about that in the back half of '17. It seems like the negative impact from those changes would have certainly had your operating margins for fiscal '18 pointing to something down you, and yet here you are giving very encouraging operating margin guidance. So other than something like Claris 1 being an incremental positive year-over-year, did anything changed in your underlying assumptions as far as those two specific pressure points that you talked about last year, competitive pressure and moderating inflation. And I guess you -- one just kind of follow on to that, I know you don't guide to gross profit within Distribution Solutions."]], [" The 3% to 5% headwind for Q1 and Q2 of this fiscal year, is that a 100% due to the export ban? Or are they not taking product that you can actually ship as well? Meaning like, are the demand signals from that specific customer deteriorating over time?", ["Okay. Great. And then as my follow-up on Huawei specifically."]], [" And is that something that\u2019s helping you convert these nine-figure relationships?", ["Yes, thank you. And I will add my congrats. So, when we see this abnormal growth and scale, what crosses my mind is that your competitors are trying to sell software tools to the IT department. And in contrast, you\u2019re really selling transformations at the top levels of the org chart. I don\u2019t think any other software company has ever had this kind of vision of transformation selling. So, I\u2019m curious where are you in that journey of building that muscle across your sales teams."]], [" Is it primarily one customer or is it multiple customers?", [" And maybe just also address the breath of the foundry push-out."]], [" So is it reasonable to think that the revenue growth decelerates a bit as we move into the year, or is your optimism around volume is such that, this recent trend is sustainable on the top line?", [" I assume, as you start to lap the pricing, you\u2019re unlikely to get those types of gains again on top of what you\u2019ve got now."]], [" So for fiscal '20, how do you see the data center part of your semi franchise performing relative to 2019? Is this going to be another strong year?", ["One of the areas obviously which has been a strong growth driver for the team in 2019 as you mentioned, Hock, has been cloud and hyperscale data center networking and compute acceleration. You got Tomahawk, Trident, Jericho, your compute and security acceleration, ASICs and the new optical connectivity portfolio. There was a bit of pause in cloud spending in the first half of this year, but it looks like that, that is starting to reaccelerate and looking to be strong in 2020. You also have the start of the 400-gig upgrade cycle."]], [" How does the outlook appear? Are you close on anything? Are you looking mostly domestically or internationally, private, public and how are valuations shaping up right now?", [" Second question -- sorry $1 billion. Second question is a tuck-in, I think Murray, you said, you want to get back to it, made the company great i.e. tuck-ins."]], [" Are you seeing increased customer bias to go with hybrid and electric drive module solutions? I guess I was just hoping to get a feel for full module versus the component mix within the electrification backlog and maybe potential impact of that higher dollar content on the backlog growth?", ["Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick follow up on the 80% backlog tied to hybrid and EVs."]], [" Is that more a function of FDO does have pricing flexibility, right, where Dollar Tree doesn\u2019t? And if we did not get the 25%, let's assume we do, but if we did not get it, does that on the incremental 15, I assume your gut feel would be to reinvest that benefit into the business not keep it?", ["And then just secondly on the tariff topic, is the mitigation at Family Dollar the 50% versus 80% spread."]], [" So can you just give us the moving pieces are or what it is you see that could drive stabilization in your same-store revenue growth in the back half of the year?", ["Hi, good morning, everybody. Tom or Tim, maybe, or I'm sorry Tom or Al, you discussed that you expect continued acceleration in your markets, you highlighted July lease rates remain well above last year. Occupancy is up on a year-over-year basis, but the revised guidance assumes same-store revenue growth stabilizes at a consistent level with what you achieved in the second quarter."]], [" And the FY \u201818 organic sales guidance seems prudent given the year we are coming off of, I guess we have had some questions about whether in 2018 whether that\u2019s the year perhaps may be to promise less in the way of actual earnings growth given the need for more reinvestment what\u2019s expected to be somewhat of a back half loaded year from an earnings growth standpoint and still likely negative volume leverage on the P&L, so perhaps you can just talk us through a little bit more of your thinking along these lines and sort of what bridges to the EPS growth given and I think you also have if I am not mistaken like $40 million incentive comp headwind as well that you may have mentioned on the last quarter, so I am just trying to get sense if all that comes together and gives you the comfort that you can do you need to do to get back to top line growth even in the context of delivering some earnings growth?", ["Okay. Thanks for that."]], [" How should we think about the mix in CapEx between building demand and replacing with there?", [" And then a second, apologize, a slightly long question. CapEx spending in the quarter and the full year were both strong. We could argue the possibilities here, it\u2019s driven by all the capacity of the demand or you having to spend a lot of it on replacing equipment as they\u2019re ageing out."]], [" And so if you think about that where you're positioned after 1Q, again to try to put a finer point on things, do you expect operating income to improve in 2019 versus 2018 in dollar terms?", ["Well, that's my second question, Jeff. Because if you look at the 1Q guide, your operating income down about $60 million year-on-year. You've made those comments consistently through the call about this is still going to be a transition year. 2020 is the optimization year."]], [" So how do you \u2013 changing the company name, all of this happening at the same time, how do you prevent it from being a distraction?", ["Okay. If I could just ask you about beyond beer or a little bit more on beyond beer as part of the portfolio, the bulk of the business is still Miller Lite or Coors Light that there is still the two most important by far as you mentioned they're showing some improving trends and you're in at the beginning of a new revitalization plan. How do you prevent beyond beer from being a distraction because if you can get those other two working, the overall business will look much better and you'll be able to invest more in beyond beer at a faster pace. But ideally you'd need to get the core in better condition first."]], [" Could you just maybe describe your thought process relative to like how you think about approving certain projects relative to their the IRR, or the NPV of the project and what copper prices you use? And just generally speaking, how you evaluate it the decision to invest the capital in that project, and maybe how that might apply to, say, your next project like El Abra or something like that?", ["Okay, great. Thanks. And just a quick question about Lone Star. So you\u2019ve made the decision to proceed with the project $850 million and around $200 million pounds of copper a year."]], [" Can you explain some of the puts and takes on that, particularly in light of the accelerated global category growth, I know you mentioned Easter, but wanted to know if there were some other things playing into that as well?", ["Hi, there. Two questions if I could. First, the updated full-year organic sales guidance of 3.5%-plus, as you mentioned, suggests perhaps a sequential deceleration in 4Q."]], [" Steve, can you talk a little bit about this really strong upfront advertising market, especially in the face of lower ratings, but like an onslaught -- a coming onslaught of non-advertising supported streaming services? When do you begin to sell your own AVOD direct-to-consumer service?", ["I have questions for Steve and also Jeremy."]], [" So is that more timing-related and you're getting traction on some of the initiatives you put into place given your focus on this area? Or is it more you're discovering greater efficiencies with that focus and that means that the confidence around improving free cash flow conversion is actually moving up as you look beyond this year?", [" And as you think about the improved free cash flow outlook, you've now raised underlying free cash flow a couple of quarters in a row ex the structural items."]], [" So that implies this next level would be closer to 7% cap, is that fair?", [" Maybe a little color on the market. And then including the stuff you\u2019ve sold out through the quarter, you\u2019re at around $150 million of sale, this leaves you another $125 million, $130 million to go, to reach your guidance. You still assume a mid-7.5% cap rate, you\u2019ve sold at about an 8% here."]], [" Could you just make sure my math is right? And also could you \u2013 do you have a thought as to whether that $900 million to $1 billion is sort of a sustainable level of CapEx that reflects modest growth projects in addition to maintenance?", ["Yes. Good morning. And thanks for all the details. If I look at your CapEx guidance just a quick question on this for the fiscal year that starts in three months \u2013 I'm sorry a year from three months from now the fiscal 2021 and I assume your DD&A saves at $1.53 billion that would suggest you would generate $2.25 billion of free cash flow, if you earn zero which is 6% of your stock price which means your free cash flow yield at zero earnings would be higher than almost all the rigid flexible packaging stocks."]], [" So is that due to the new price instruction -- structure, sorry?", [" I asked in relation to your declining products in Mexico and Central America where volumes rebounded in Brazil and in June."]], [" Can you maybe talk about revenue outlook in a low to mid-$50 type environment, and how we could think about your international margins perhaps over the back half of the year and maybe on a longer-term basis?", [" It sounds like price pressure continues in certain areas."]], [" And I was just wondering can you give us a sense of the magnitude of that acceleration by gearing down? For example, are there any other operational efficiencies associated with adjusting to mid-teens besides the $100 million of sales facility savings that you mentioned in your prepared remarks?", ["So the release indicates that you're accelerating free cash flow generation by adjusting to a mid-teens longer term growth profile versus previously you're at that 20% CAGR."]], [" So why do you think that spread is expanding and was larger in the first quarter than it's been in some time?", ["Good morning. Thanks a lot of taking my question. So when we look at the spread between Family Dollar same-store sales and Dollar general same-store sales that were also reported this morning, that expanded to 320 basis points. And we have seen pretty steady expansion in that spread for the last couple of years now. And it's not a completely clean number, but it really is the only way that we have to benchmark the influence of the teams having over its own performance."]], [" Can you talk about your cost curve? What kind of learning you're seeing from a cost perspective?", [" And then last one, on your cost curve, obviously, the price per LRIP is coming down like 5%, 6%."]], [" So I guess, taking a step back and looking under the hood a little bit, what are you seeing that's slowing down that growth? And looking ahead, what products do you expect to perhaps contribute more to the growth from here?", ["I want to go back to data services for a second, and Scott, appreciate the more kind of holistic approach to the segment, but really wanted to zone in on pricing and analytics. I think, historically, this has been viewed as kind of the fastest growth engine within the segment, and it looks like the dynamics are slowing down a little bit. If you look at ASV, it's up 5% year-over-year. I think this time last year, it was going to be up 8%."]], [" What's the math there, that the $450 million is what you need to get to the targeted credit metrics to tip you to investment grade, and then therefore there was $800 million left over? Or is there some other rationale there?", ["So looking at Slide 28, it seems fairly straightforward, just the update from Q4. You've just sliced -- there was a bucket of $1.25 billion of unallocated discretionary cash in Q4, which you've now sort of sliced into $450 million, which is essentially targeted for potential debt paydown and $800 million, which is still unallocated versus the $1.25 billion that was unallocated on the Q4 call."]], [" But how has the pickup been among the SMBs, especially among the local advertisers? Do you think you can target that market without a sales force?", ["Okay. Sundar, just picking up on the AI for everyone theme, you\u2019ve been highlighting at I/O as well as other venues. Are conversations with advertisers suggest that products like smart bidding are becoming a pretty -- increasingly popular tool to add to their bidding strategies."]], [" So as you think about sort of sustainability, is sort of 6% to 7% range is sustainable over the intermediate term and how you think about Abbott\u2019s ability to deliver double-digits or low-teen earnings given the currency environment and all these various opportunities to grow?", ["Okay. Thank you. So Miles, two questions for you.

So I just wanted to see if you could give a little more detail around that statement. From our perspective when you think about the impact of the storms and I think you\u2019ve alluded to this in previous questions, it seems like it\u2019s more around fixing existing homes, getting insurance recoveries, power related, et cetera.

But you then need, for the fourth quarter, margins to grow over 100 basis points. And I do see the organic implied is a little faster in the fourth quarter, about 4%; third quarter, 3.5%. So maybe that explains it. But I was kind of hoping to hear on -- maybe making the guide seem easier, that the third quarter drag on price/cost was greater in the fourth quarter.

And then also the guidance, you nudged a little higher for the full-year."]], [" Help us just understand have there been meaningful offsets, or should we expect a spike perhaps in that investment pace in the second half?", ["Wanted to just inquire about the initial guidance given this year around the $1 billion investment; you mentioned some timing factors between SG&A in 1Q and 2Q. But even looking at the guidance provided for 2Q, the first half is certainly running at a run-rate below that of $1 billion in investments."]], [" And relative to that aspired 40% to 45% North American incremental, what do CPS incrementals have to be in order to land that 20% North America margin?", ["Thanks. Good morning. So on the guidance, it looks like the incremental for the second quarter for CPS is in the vicinity of like 25%. And I'm just curious as to when you conducted your call of a few weeks back on the operational update, Dave talked about aspirational North America margins over the course of the next several quarters and then a couple of years in the 20% arena. And in order to do that, we had to land kind of a sort of glide path of 40% to 45% sequential incrementals for several quarters. And I'm just curious, with regard to CPS, I think you guys had an 18% incremental Q1, a guided 25% incremental for Q2."]], [" Can you give us a sense? Is it a broader set of products you\u2019ve increased this time? Is it the same sort of magnitude of rate increase? Can you give us kind of compare and contrast on this December rate increase and the March rate increase?", ["And specifically, on the 4Q call. I think you talked about increasing rates on money market deposits 10 million and over by 20 basis points and rate on certain of the higher balance retail products by 15 basis points."]], [" Maybe could you just remind us a little bit, what participation you have that's driving that?", ["Hey. Good afternoon. I just want to go to the shared savings in the quarter."]], [" Could you just give us some color on what's going on there and changing the timing? And whether we should be reading into the trajectory of the turnaround plan based on that?", ["Okay. And maybe just lastly, you talked about that $7 billion of cash spending on restructuring, the number has been quite low. I think lower than you had originally anticipated in 2019, and it's only up a bit in 2020. Presumably some of the cost savings are kind of tied to the cash restructuring rather than the headline GAAP charges."]], [" Where do you see the notional dollar amount is going in 2017 and 2018 or the other underwriting expense?", ["Thanks for fitting me in. A year ago, you mentioned that you have not done hiring in the insurance division. And in the prepared remarks today, you mentioned due to market turmoil, you have accelerated those investments. At Heartland, I see other underwriting expenses up about $9 million quarter over quarter."]], [" Isn't there a case here to take some short-term pain to restructure your operation a little quicker, take the service hit, but then on a go-forward basis be generating that same growth rate at a much lower OR?", ["Yeah, thanks very much, operator. Good morning, everyone. Just coming back on the OR question. And Jim, I always thought that I understood that and it did make sense that you want to have a balanced approach to operating ratio improvement with growth. What we've seen however is that you can have both while there is initial kind of disruption as you realign your network to achieve a structurally lower OR, but that disruption effectively goes away. And we've seen evidence of it certainly with the Canadian peers and starting to see it with the U.S. \u2013 with the CSX. They're generating operating ratio of about 500 or more basis point difference than you, but still in the case of, for example, CNCP, they're guiding to 5% to 7% growth, which is probably as much growth as you'd want."]], [" Does that mean we're done? Or is there scope to increase that $1 billion target for 2019?", ["Yeah. That was really helpful actually. Thank you for the color. And I guess just the second one on capital allocation. You guys finished with the $1 billion repurchases that you expected for the full year."]], [" But I'm just curious if there's anything in the quarter you view as ongoing? Or if it was just a weaker quarter in terms of underwriting? And some of the other things you mentioned on capital markets and reserve true ups?", ["Hi, thanks. Good morning. In Asia, the earnings this quarter were about $50 million lower than the full year quarterly average ex-notable items. I think John you mentioned reserve item."]], [" Any further thoughts on Cassius [ph]?", ["So I really wanted to ask about uses of cash [indiscernible] by that performance in the first quarter. I believe [indiscernible] worth $2 billion less authorized and just wanted you to refresh if you could if that pace is sustainable and again we have a pretty high forecast for further free cash flow generation, even beyond this current authorization."]], [" How is that coloring how are you looking for the rest of the year?", ["One operational question and one more about the balance sheet. In light of having absorbed that much fleet from the acquisitions, you got hit with weather a little bit during the quarter. If you think about the way the rates played out for the quarter with that fleet utilization as challenged as it was."]], [" Could you sort of explain that a little bit, maybe if the investing in your -- like tax benefits?", ["Okay, that's great. My second question on full year guidance. The midpoint of it is about $500 million for the full year. In the first half, you already achieved like $230 million. So when you imply the second half, you probably need $270 million net operating earnings, and that's including the TWG contribution. My estimate each month is sort of around $9 million, so that will be sort of more than $50 million or $60 million, which imply the underlying business -- other business right now. Second half earnings will be less than the first half."]], [" So I guess the first question is, is there anything that really kind of changed in terms of biscuit growth trajectory into '19? And is that partially driven off of different GDP expectations?", ["Okay, fair. And then just housekeeping items, and that's all I have, is, from the Investor Day, I believe you had said the expectation was, essentially into next year, favorable trends in terms of GDP improvements, which would drive, let's call it, that 3% category growth. It seems like snacking may be -- all-in may be driven more by biscuits, and Q3 came in a bit. It sounds like the category growth is a bit below what the strat plan showed, as you said."]], [" Can you give us any timeframe of that $100 billion and how much debt do you think about in terms of net cash zero?", [" And you said you would execute the buyback at a fast pace."]], [" Should we assume this progression to be relatively linear? Just trying to understand how much is factored in the low-double-digit guide?", [" You noted that the expected cost savings to reach $300 million, $500 million run rate."]], [" Just making sure on the domestic side, how \u2013 is it volume domestically has price mix come in stronger, has unit costs in the first half of the year been better than the domestic kind of base business performance has exceeded the expectations to that extent there, just help me with that bridge?", ["A lot of ground has been covered. I just wanted to go back on the guidance. Make sure, I've got the pieces correct to understand how you've adjusted the outlook. So, you've taken the range of $10 million, that includes $10 million less contribution from the purchase of the JV share. So, the base business outlook is up at least $20 million probably a little higher above that given what would seem to be a weaker outlook in Europe given the cost side there."]], [" Hunt still view Intermodal as a secularly growing business? Or is it just becoming more cyclical in nature as you've gotten bigger, supply chains are getting shorter and the Class 1 railroads continue to work to extract value from their partners?", ["If you look back over the last six years, the Intermodal business has compounded profit growth of about 2% per year. If you look at the 6 years before that, it was closer to 11%, and that period actually includes the Great Recession right in the middle of it. From a real high-level and long-term view, is -- does management and the board of J.B."]], [" Just wondering how you feel about that monetization level given all the usage you're seeing there, and is there significant room to raise that when you compare it to other social networks?", ["Great. Thank you. I'd like to ask a couple of bigger picture things on the new disclosures. So, first on YouTube monetization, assuming you have about 2 billion users, it's about $7 or $8 per user."]], [" So they're already sort of higher value, that's question one? And then question two is when we think about additional services, I think you talked about 20% of the ARPU uplift this year came from things like fraud protection or audit insurance, is that an expanding part of the pie, is that going to continue to drive an incrementally higher amount of growth in consumer tax?", ["Just on the consumer tax outlook Brad, I just had a couple of questions. You outlined three things that made your buckets if you will that you think can drive the growth and I had two specific questions. One is on the acquisition of -- or condition of assisted, are we getting to a point now where SmartLook is actually driving sort of more users to TurboTax and if so do they tend to be higher value users in the sense that they're not 1040 filers that tend to come from assisted."]], [" Like, is there other lines of business, other revenue streams that people should be thinking about that create substantial opportunities, and specifically subscription, and then maybe if you could just touch on from a commerce standpoint now that Instagram's starting to be such a big driver of commerce, how do you think about diversifying revenues versus essentially being almost pure advertising?", ["Hi. Thanks for taking the question. When you think about the opportunities for the business broadly, you obviously are crushing it from an advertising standpoint when you look at any measure of growth. But wondering as you think about how you take this massive platform of users and engagement that you have across all your platforms, I'm thinking about if you look at like what Spotify has been able to achieve in music subscriptions, what Apple even has done in music subscriptions, what Netflix is doing in video, Amazon obviously now crossing 100 million subscribers."]], [" So how do you get away from the fact that you might be selling businesses that ultimately leave you with a company with just structurally lower industrial free cash flow by definition?", [" Because despite the fact that you said at the outset that there isn't an existential question here with respect to GE, the fact of the matter is any asset sales that you're going to garner or that are going to be accretive or give a good valuation are probably some of the better cash- and growth-led assets of the company."]], [" So does non-crypto fiat currency become an opportunity for you?", ["Thanks. I have two, one for Sheryl and Dave and one for Mark. So Sheryl and Dave, you noted the growth I guess in Europe this time in acceleration. And can you talk a bit about maybe the regional development of Stories and either the embracing the advertising community or the user community by region. And then, for Mark on the answer on currency arguably Crypto is going to take a long time to you to get approval or to build a product. Do you see building a fiat currency wallet for Facebook and Instagram. I know it\u2019s about WhatsApp but how does another title wallet non-crypto wallet develop if it takes a while for the other products to rollout meaning Crypto takes a while for approval."]], [" market already and you have got clinical data and things of that sort? Should we expect an accelerated adoption in some of these new markets internationally?", [" And then just with respect to the Mako in Japan, you got the full indications across the portfolio. So just how should we expect adoption to ramp there given you have had five years in the U.S."]], [" Like, does this restructuring savings of $90 million to $100 million, is that enough to sort of have you sort of hold core BorgWarner margins over that 2023 time period?", [" Because you have the high margin legacy business declining, the new electric business ramping."]], [" So just curious on how you are really kind of thinking about marketing going over the next 1 to 2, 3 years? And then just lastly, Mark, talked a lot about newness on this call, how do you think about managing SKU productivity to maximize your margin output and inventory turnover going forward?", ["Hey, thanks a lot. When you see the broad-based strength across all the categories, it tells me actually that the marketing has been super important and Reed\u2019s impact has been extremely important here. I guess my question is how do you think about evolving the marketing going forward and how do you kind of make it the different or the same in the U.S. versus Europe and Asia, because clearly, it\u2019s a signal that more marketing is better and Reed\u2019s, the way he is doing the marketing is totally unique and it\u2019s really bringing the brand and it\u2019s esthetic out into the marketplace again."]], [" And then as you kind of look at the growth in mass in October that 8% year-over-year growth that drove that $4 million of EBITDA per day, how much of that is share gain versus market dynamics and just relative growth rates in mass? And then my final question, skipping over to Las Vegas, can you remind us what some of the specific strategies going after some of the domestic gaming segments versus where the focus was heretofore?", ["Great. That's helpful."]], [" But just anecdotally, did you see any impact or - on that?", [" It certainly doesn't seem evident in MAU numbers."]], [" So how was it that the business is more aligned and less cyclical than what we\u2019ve seen [Technical Difficulty]?", ["I guess two part from me, and I mean you made the comment, Gary, in your prepared remarks that the business is seeing less fluctuations. But you three months ago said that July was going to be the bottom and October would grow and now you\u2019re guiding October revenues down about 10%."]], [" Do you guys have a current estimate of that kind of addressable market and loving update there as well?", [" I know it\u2019s going to move year-to-year, but that seems like a very large number. So I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s maybe a reasonable starting point for our models. And then the 27 billion opportunity to capture proceeds, what are you guys thinking about as a good target of retention there, especially as you\u2019re looking to do more with the RIA\u2019s to win more of their wallet. And then I guess just the last piece, I know it\u2019s a long question, the bigger picture with RIA, getting them into the corporate services customers and getting them in front of the participants."]], [" Is that the way to think about it like over a 10-year time horizon and that the average of all of that is somewhere in the middle? Is that what you're kind of saying when you're giving that math?", ["Right. And then last question, I said earlier that the -- I think it was Mark or somebody, over the next 12 to 24 months, you're looking at GAAP re-leasing spreads in the 20s, and that the mark-to-market for the full portfolio is 14% to 15%. I just want to make sure I have that logically correct. The stuff that's about to expire the next year or 2 is call it -- has had the benefit of 10 years of existence and so you kind of get the market rent growth from that. And then at the other end of the spectrum, stuff that just got re-let is effectively 0% GAAP re-leasing spread at this point from a mark-to-market perspective."]], [" Is that why the retail off take looks so much better than the sell-in numbers that you have?", ["The first and I want to come back and revisit a couple of points made already. First on North America and I don\u2019t want this to overshadow the momentum you have outside of North America, which obviously matters more. But the comments in terms of the service level, it's a bit hard to flow with the retail off take data that we see, which it looked rather strong. It's hard to understand how retail off take data would be so strong, if you\u2019re not able to fill the shelf's. So is this really an out of stock situation at retail or has the service level effectively result in you being destocked."]], ["1% LTM ROE that you're running, is there any regulatory lag in the system?", ["I got you. Okay. And then secondly, Nick, you talk about having your sort of blended portfolio ROE somewhere in the 10% range, which is obviously where you're tracking right now.

So given that the decline -- easing demand wasn't really expected. I have kind of a large question, which is that, our view is that inventory is not necessarily tight because there's been high existing sales in many markets. And now with Western markets, a variety of markets showing rising inventory levels and falling sales. What would potentially be the implications for your business if inventory is not as tight as we -- as the nominal number suggests."]], [" So should we \u2013 is my math right in suggesting that you get something in the neighborhood of a $75 million benefit per quarter for every 25 basis point cut in your trading book? Because obviously in the past sometimes we've kind of looked at your NII growth and expansion in the rising rate environment, and maybe it hasn't grown as much as we thought because of the headwinds in the trading portfolio, but as short-term rates move down should we see the opposite side of that also occur and some of those headwinds get mitigated by expended margins in your trading book?", ["Hey, good morning guys. Couple of questions. First, I wanted to key in on something you said, Paul, on the rate sensitivity. You mentioned, I know its crude approximation, but 25 basis point cut on the short end, it's about $175 million a quarter, but that's just the banking book and your liability sensitive in your trading book.

And then the second question, you folks have demonstrated, through cycles, going back, obviously, the past couple are even more, a nimbleness as market conditions adjust. And so I would expect, the weakness having started during a seasonally slow period of year, that nimbleness was probably an advantage.

I just want to go back to guidance for a second, maybe come at it just a little bit different way. In the first quarter, earnings were up $1.22. And I know, obviously, leap year that's part of that. But for the full year, your guidance is that earnings are only up $0.60. So it implies that the combined earnings over the next three quarters are actually down.

I was wondering if -- there shouldn't be any lingering impact from that. Let's say, if your stock price would remain flat into next year, should there -- the reason I'm asking is because 1Q guide on SG&A is for flat, even though your closings are up about 7%, just kind of like what you're thinking for the year."]], [" Are they completely all out the door now and into your retail distribution VAR channel?

Then, when we look at the $945 million column that you gave on one of the slides, I am really trying to understand savings that would be expected after fiscal \u201819 and I just want confirmation of the math, so it\u2019s $945 million, you did $455 million to-date and then you have got $120 million projected for fiscal \u201819 so I believe that would leave a sizable $370 million in projected savings after fiscal \u201819."]], [" So maybe diagnose -- was that more Morphe?", ["So first, on the -- the digitally-native brands; it's really impressive in terms of how it drove that traffic and retail comp acceleration."]], [" But my question really is, what did you see in the third quarter? Was it coming in?", ["Yeah. Thanks. And I actually may circle back after the call with maybe a couple of thoughts, but I guess, Andrew or Shane, I guess, another question here. I think the rule of thumb on RASM when it comes to new flying historically has been around sort of 80% of system RASM, and please correct me on that."]], [" So I was hoping you could comment broadly on your expectations for the company from a volume and price mix perspective, has that changed at all since you last updated your guidance?", ["Thanks. Good afternoon and I want to extend my congratulations also to Stephen and Kevin. So, best wishes to both of you. I wanted to point of clarification on the sales growth guidance. So you\u2019re mentioning the 1% to 3% year-over-year sales growth. That includes 1 point track from Aplicare, but the FX guidance and I apologize if I missed this, it was previously a 1 point headwind but the dollar has weakened now, so that should be seemly probably flat or maybe even a little bit of a help."]], [" Is there an expectation or a focus incrementally that, on that payments business, on having it become a bigger part of the pie? And would you look at acquisitions?", ["The one thing, Roger, that you sounded a little more incrementally excited about for Discover is the growth of the payments business. That did have very nice growth, and there's probably nothing that could help your valuation multiple more than if that became a bigger piece of the pie. And it seems like a significant opportunity to do that with the network that you have."]], [" I'm just wondering if there were any kind of follow-ups on that?", [" And then just as a follow-up. I wanted to ask around just sales execution in the EMEA region, there were -- we talked about some issues last quarter."]], ["75 is an attractive target on its own but the question I have is what's the key in your internal model to unlocking that wording of \"at least\" within that stated target?

I think the $3."]], [" Would that \u2013 if you do take that and that assumes if you divest it, would that reduce allocated equity to the Legacy segment or is that not going to be an adjustment there?", ["Good morning.

And I realize you've had a better top line lately, but one could argue, it took a $300 million spending infusion to get there. And I think, more importantly, you took a $15 billion write-down on 2 of your biggest brands, Kraft and Oscar Mayer. And to me, that literally means the brand equities there aren't what they used to be. So when investors are looking at the consistent financial disappointments at Kraft, maybe even bringing the eye into the discussion."]], [" Could you give us a sense as to transitional costs would be in '20 offsetting some of the benefits that we get from the projects?", [" And you did also mention that there would be some costs related, for instance the Florence, et cetera."]], [" How is ONEOK positioned if this materializes? Is it offset by the full scale system that you have in place?", ["Okay great. And then just a follow-up, ethane recovery versus rejection has been a topic for some time. There's kind of an interesting developing market dynamic where you look at natural gas capacity being scarce in the Permian. And at times you've seen some sizeable differentials with Waha and, and Henry Hub, it could create a scenario where the economics of recovering ethane becomes greater in the Permian than any other basin in the country. And there's the possibility that Permian ethane recovery crowds out other basins."]], [" So I know you're going to get into this in a couple weeks, can you just frame for us what a $55 world, what does Conoco think about by way of growth versus continued debt-adjusted per share growth?", ["I may give it a go so just one forward-looking and one about the quarter, if I may. $55 Brent all the way out in the strip from what we can tell now.

How those markets may differ structurally from both the United States and Europe and any incremental challenges in those markets that you may be facing?", ["Hey, good afternoon.

These markets primarily consisted of Latin American/Asian countries, just want to ask in light of Ticketmaster\u2019s recent expansion into Asia, in Taiwan and Singapore."]], [" But I guess what I am trying to get or hoping you can provide some color on is, how should we think about margin gating next year?", ["Great. That's helpful. And Steve, maybe as a follow-up, just on 2020 guidance, 6% to 9% EPS growth. It would imply, I am assuming anyway, a little bit of leverage in the model in addition to maybe some repo and other helpers below the revenue line as well."]], ["4], versus our IaaS/PaaS revenue rates, just wondering about how strong the new deals have been that you've signed in the last six months?

Thank you. Maybe just a first question around overall cadence of demand in recent months. Your organic sales growth was 8% in Q1, it\u2019s guided at the midpoint at 3% in Q3, so a pretty severe slowdown with comps that are not that different."]], [" Would you say what gives you confidence in the second half pickup in organic growth that you talked about? Is that you're seeing broad-based growth in heavy industries, whether it's oil and gas, semicon, mining? Maybe you could give us a little bit more color on different markets within heavy industries, and if any of those markets are actually picking up, as we speak?", ["Good morning. So heavy industries as you know a lot of different end markets within heavy industries."]], [" One, I understand that you are reinvesting in the tax benefits, but can you clarify whether that\u2019s more heavily geared to reinvesting in beverages or is it pretty much evenly across the business? And the second question which is related to that when you see a success that Coca-Cola has had with the Diet Coke new products and with Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, any thoughts in terms of how things would be done different on the Pepsi side of things?

Two quick questions."]], [" So, can you just talk about the messaging for shareholders here about repaying that debt, is simply a commitment to debt holders, what does it tell us about your interest in growth minded M&A or frankly larger would someone call more transformational M&A?", ["Good morning. Two strategic questions to start off and I\u2019ll jump back in queue. The first is on cap deployment, the second one on margins. And maybe Omar or Karen, on capital deployment, if we think about the last access to cash you have between Puerto Rico and in the Cardinal assets, it\u2019s $8 billion, 7 of that is going to go into debt repayment."]], [" This quarter was a good quarter, right?", ["Yes, hi. Good afternoon, guys and a solid quarter. My question around \u2013 my real question for you is, Rodney, if we take a step back and just assess the last year and the evolution of the state of the business \u2013 your business, your stock has gone from $30 to $20 back to $30."]], [" How should we think about, is it the potential for a little bit further of a step-down or what is the dynamic that might keep you from seeing mid-teens to an upper teens on a percent of revenue for CapEx?", ["Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I guess, I wanted to maybe get a sense of the CapEx profile. So elevated year in 2019 as you are bringing some new locomotive on to the network and that sort of step-down below 20%. As we are seeing PSR implemented for some of the other railroads, there\u2019s been a really meaningful draw down in capital spending as a lot of assets gets [hard] [ph]."]], [" Just give us some color, what\u2019s driving the higher run rate? Are you just seeing more client wins? And is that the run rate through 2018 as well or is that just some investment for the back half for this year?", ["Sounds good. Thank you, Jim. If I could just ask one final one.

So, two quick ones from us."]], [" So just given those factors, should we expect more reinvestment by the business as you look going forward? Could it be significant, or are you pretty comfortable with the level of investment that you're planning for leaving 2018?", ["Hey, good morning. Congrats, Tom and Mike. So I have two main questions. First, I guess this is just more of a forward-looking version of Jason's question, but I'd love to hear about any plans going forward in terms of reinvestment by the business in marketing or other areas under your leadership, Mike, it's typical that a new CEO often chooses to take the opportunity to reinvest in the business, there's been some market share pressure recently, theoretically, you need to support the business post pricing."]], [" And particularly, if I look at GBS, could you make some comments on the durability of that?", ["Jim, I also want to ask about services and the growth rates."]], [" So question number one, can you just give some concrete examples in terms of things that you can do to drive the growth higher? Is this going to be a largely a bolt-on strategy or there's things you can do with the core business? And then the second question is, are we going to get an RX announcement on May 9th, and is there a scenario where you guys step back and say, hey, the math or the demand for this asset isn't there, we're going to separate on the platform, but maybe we'll hold on to it for some period longer until things look different?", [" So there's been some, I think understandable investor pushback on the differentiation of the new strategy going forward moving the self-care and when we look at the current CHCA business that the new product sales continue to attract under that $50 million level obviously the pressure that you've called that on the core business."]], [" So how do you view that, then, going forward in your program?", [" And for reference, I know one of your peers here a few quarters ago noted about a 30% degradation in going to four wells per section per zone."]], [" So I mean which of those is kind of the right go-forward margin? Or can you just kind of help us think about the shape of that segment's margin going forward since you're layering in something much different than the legacy segment?", ["When you had first when you had your first full quarter the second quarter of 2019 of Aeryon and Endeavor and you the Government & Defense segment margin was 24 eight you stated that you saw that as the most diluted margin from the acquisitions. And then it was up over 20 sequentially but then it's back down sequentially in the fourth quarter somewhere in between second and third."]], [" So, on the recent acquisition you did of Younique, I want to understand a bit better why buying a direct selling business makes sense for a branded beauty company?

Okay. And then switching back to the commentary on this M&A focus, not new but the re-emphasis."]], [" So, do you anticipate inventories actually moving higher here in the May quarter, before it starts to down shift in the back half of the calendar year?", ["Great. Thank you for letting me ask the question here. So, back to a question on inventory. So, when you first started seeing your customer demand inventory related weakness, it always takes time for the actual supply growth output of your manufacturing infrastructure to kind of trend towards your target. So, initially, you augment that manufacturing ramp down with some inventory accumulation. It appears that you executed to that in fiscal Q2. But, now that you're moderating output lower again, again, that's going to appear that it's going to take some more time."]], [" How resilient is that improved growth and trajectory versus -- and what do you hear when you're talking to the regions about, perhaps, the jitters that get caused out of the volatility and how that might impact growth?", ["Mike, in your opening comments, you made a good blend of thought across better, synchronized global growth and yet the volatility. And I just wanted to ask you, this comes up a lot with the investor community but tends to be more resilient in the business model. We've seen better results out of Asia and Latin America, especially in Consumer."]], [" I just want to make sure those are sort of the numbers that we're talking about for the 3Q?", ["Hey, good morning. I appreciate the commentary about the PBM and given how focused the Street is on that metric. I just want to clarify that we're on the same page. So if you look at the second quarter of 2018, ESI reported $1.395 billion of core EBITDA if we grow that mid-single digit 5%, that's about $1.465 billion, which would represent about a $250 million sequential increase."]], [" Is there a risk that that pulled forward any revenue from 2020?", ["Yes, thank you for the question. You talked a lot about the very strong transactional performance in the quarter, I think better than your expectations."]], [" If you exclude those headwinds, could you help us with what 2019 margin would have looked like, I guess I'm just trying to understand that over the next couple years, should we expect pretty healthy margins snap back in 2020 absent those headwinds or is the gap closure to goal that 15% more weighted to 2021?", ["Thanks a lot. Good morning everybody. My question is really the pathway from where you seem to be guiding margins in 2019 somewhere in the low to mid 9% range to the goal to be at 15%, mid-cycle operating margins by 2022. The margins headwinds that you had through 2019 appear to be dissipating similar to the FX headwind called out for ag and turf."]], [" What is the degree of conviction in the second half moving to sort of a 3% 4% organic growth rate?", ["Thanks. Good morning. We've touched on a lot already, but I do want to pick up on the last question from Julian. The growth in Refrigeration & Food, we've got a slight down organic in the first half of the year. Backlog is pretty flat. We burned backlog in 2Q modestly."]], [" I'm just wondering how you're thinking about given this current retail environment, is there sort of a chance? Or how we should be thinking about maybe a slow down or a slow wing of stabilization on some of those new development assets?

But current consensus estimates for this year about 4% FFO growth and next year, it accelerates a little bit about 6.5%. I recognize you have some major developments opening, with also some capitalize costs coming into the mix."]], [" Can you provide any color on magnitude of operating margin expansion going forward, especially when the benchmark against those key players?", ["Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on the results. My question for Ken on at the conclusion of the last call, Ken, you mentioned that Mark was transitioning from a primary care to a specialty care business and that the three most important franchises would be certainly oncology, vaccines and Animal Health going forward. When we look at the revenue generated from those businesses. It's basically two-thirds of your revenue around the time of loss of exclusivity of JANUVIA in the U.S. And when we benchmark the incremental revenue that you're driving from those three businesses and benchmark oncology versus Roche vaccines versus GSK and Animal Health versus Zoetis, it certainly implies that operating margins expand quite substantially, especially beyond 2022."]], [" Can you may be dissect what's going on in there and why the deceleration year-over-year?", ["This is Damien on for Ramsey, so thanks for taking the questions. I just -- I'm hoping you guys can talk a little bit about your long-term growth expectations for the PEO and insurance revenue. Obviously, you've provided that preliminary framework for 2020 which I really appreciate at the low double-digits but I think -- we're thinking about that more like a mid-teens type of a rate."]], [" I'm just trying to think about is the expectation that you're going to get significant acceleration in pricing, much better mix, productivity on the cost side, layout of feed costs?", ["I mean, you talked in the Q of $30 million of freight, growout and outside meat purchase inflation, which matters, but it's not an enormous delta."]], [" This one has a nice so start off the ground with the analytic side where can you take it from here?", [" AWS has been fantastic."]], [" And as you're thinking about the priorities of how to reaccelerate growth in NAB, is there a greater cohesiveness with Frito that could be part of that strategy?", [" Is that an unfair assessment that the company has not done as well as it could possibly could in terms of cross-selling and utilizing the strength of both of these businesses."]], [" Can you may be comment on how you think we should or how we should think about kind of layering into seasonality given the commentary you\u2019ve had?", ["Okay, okay. And then as we think about your $20 million or so of spending in how things are going to layer in through the year as well as kind of growth. Normally, in terms of seasonality I might start to look at the Q2 being may be a little more challenging, but you have this acceleration and then you have a very strong back half now."]], [" So I just wanted to get your reaction to that thought process? Is there any reason why that cash conversion should really change materially in the next couple of years?", ["I just want to kick-off with the free cash question just Bill as you were going through those details; but look at -- your guidance right now, your EBITDA and free cash conversion looks like it's 35% to 40% at least for 2018 but looking further out is there any reason that you can't hold that level of conversion for the next several years because if EBITDA continues to grow you're presumably kicking off $1.5 billion for year on consensus numbers for the foreseeable future."]], [" So the key part of the message here that your margins are a heck of a lot more stable than people realize, can you comment on that and can you actually take margins higher from here?", ["Okay. Thanks very much, guys. And then I want to ask, just talk a little bit about margins. It\u2019s very clear a lot of investors still view your company as incredibly cyclical and the same company it was 10 to 15 years ago and value the stock that way. But if you look at the last five years for supposedly cyclical business, your rental gross margins have been 42% to 43% for five years in a row and that\u2019s through a pretty challenging industrial recessions, same holds true for EBITDA margins.

Congrats on the excellent quarter for sure, but I want to focus if I could first on the sales outlook. I appreciate it\u2019s early in the year, Karen, you certainly helped us understand that and then you want to stay conservative. But \u2013 and you have just got us to 5.5% to 6% for the second quarter. If I focus on the second quarter, help me understand to be as I think about the second quarter very similar to the fiscal first quarter in terms of comparisons, I mean, the tremendous pipeline performance, ongoing cost reductions etcetera. Maybe if you could give us a little more color on why the fiscal second quarter wouldn\u2019t be even better than that guidance 5.5%, especially given the relatively easy comps, the hurricane impacted year ago numbers.

Last quarter, you said Sterling was about 60% to 70% utilized. So, I think that leaves 130, 140,000 barrels a day open. I\u2019m guessing some of that is expected for the ethane extraction that you\u2019re expecting and some of that\u2019s for just general growth in Oklahoma production."]], [" And then question two, if you could just talk a little bit about what you meant by consumer meaningful innovation across the business in the context of what's always been a very simple, straightforward menu and the operations that go with that?", [" So that was question one."]], [" What\u2019s so different with the international operations?", ["Good morning, gentlemen and thank you Bill for the candor in this process, to be candid.

Is this just a temporary dip in the order rate do you expect with the strong demand reacceleration later on this year?", [" And if so, I heard a couple of different things about the replacements for those, that they will be coming on in 2Q which would imply that you could see some reacceleration in the absorption of order growth rate.

There's a lot of additional color, which I really appreciate, especially the comments about Image Manager, Bot Manager, and SOASTA reaching $100 million run rate. I wanted to dive in a little bit around CapEx. I know you guided to only spending about 10% to 12% of revenue in 1Q, but there's more coming in the second quarter around the network refresh cycle.

So, John, I understand the uncertainty around the phone sales."]], [" And then secondly, outside of basic shopping center leasing, where else do you have to grow? What other ways do you have to grow?", ["I'll keep in. I mean there is no doubt. By the way, if you were hired at any retailer\u2019s real estate department and you did not try to take advantage of an oversupply situation in the country, you probably wouldn't be there that long. So there is no question that every retailer has adopted the position of getting the best deal. That's not different than it's ever been. There is no question that in a more oversupplied environment that they play that card higher. Answer now your own question, when there are no other opportunities, you can play it all out but you don't win. On places where there is more opportunities, you do win. And that goes back to my volatility point from earlier on. I see a bigger spread between good deals and not so good deals from that perspective. I don't think there's a company out there that can say that the retail real estate industry is not in a position of change, does not have a overall over supplied phenomenon associated with it. So you have to look at two things; In your specific real estate what leverage do you have to a deal and at what terms."]], [" With the submissions in Canada, Australia, Brazil and Japan, can you give us an update on timing for those markets as well as kind of what you\u2019re feeling about in the EU?", [" And then my second question is on Simparica Trio."]], [" And I\u2019m curious, the $73 billion of new grants in purchases, is that a reasonable starting point?", ["Maybe a follow-up here just on corporate services. So I appreciate, I guess, the walk up and walk down of those assets."]], [" How much of this transition is actually impacting your guide for Q2 as well?", ["I just wait to dig a bit into your deferred product revenues this quarter that when increased I think by a bit more than a $1 billion year-on-year and actually $700 million or so, almost $700 million sequentially. So it\u2019s a very impressive performance and the question I have is, how do I take that into account when I look at your overall product performance. So you have product revenues slightly down in the quarter, but I would assume that a lot of that is related to the transition towards your subscription business model. So do you have any estimate of how much this transition has impacted your number this quarter and then of course I have the same question for next quarter, your guide is very conservative."]], [" So for those incremental barrels, where would you be selling those? Would they be on rail, et cetera?", ["John, appreciate your comments on the Bakken takeaway where I think you are better positioned than your peers given your 50,000 barrels per day or so on DAPL, et cetera, and I think you only sell about 20% in the local markets today. My question is as we think about the incremental barrel that you produce in the Bakken, in our model we have you going from the mid-70s in oil to the low 90s in oil."]], [" How are you thinking about the M&A criteria today given where valuations are?", ["Okay, that's helpful. On the capital deployment side, by our estimates, you still have more than $10 billion of M&A capacity over the next year, and that's factoring in Brammer and that's just with cash.

And then maybe on \u2013 back on the strategic review for the Public Relations and Digital Media. Obviously, you\u2019ll announce something when you have something.

Or are we doing the right thing by kind of just ignoring it?", ["Hey. Good morning, everybody. Doug, you have this plan to achieve pre-tax profits mid-cycle of $5 billion. Over the last year or so, it feels like you may have been retreating from that somewhat. Consensus estimates certainly don't embrace that outcome and now, of course, you're adding additional costs to your internal forecast."]], [" But, can you just sort of backfill for us, particularly given the $450 million of gross cost saves, why perhaps the op margin expansion will be greater and the free cash flow expansion will be greater?", ["Yes. Got it, understood. And then, Bill, just quickly on the 2020 op margin guidance and free cash flow guidance. I think, you\u2019ve put the part of this to the 13% margin, which is flat and the free cash flow, which is kind of relatively flat. It sounds like the -- at least part of that -- the reason for the flatness is that you\u2019re backing -- you\u2019re sort of saying as you take out the license impact from Fuji Xerox, it actually -- the margin would actually be up in 2020.

But the Coyote IP90s look a lot closer to that parent well type curve."]], [" To the extent that they were expecting resurgence in the back half of the year, is that something that we should expect from you as well?", ["So just to be clear, there are a number of product cycles around 400-gig around servers, around some other key components and most of the other companies in the \u2013 the broader macro arena that you're competing in have indicated that they expected weakness in the first half of the year from cloud. You were bucking that trend. Now, you seem to be more in line with the prior commentary from the other companies that are in the space."]], ["7% yield is better than it had been in the past, but just a view of tightening disposal capacity, and these cost pressures, could this be an area where maybe you can push price a little bit more and we can going to see it tick up passed the 2% range?", ["Thank you for taking the questions. Actually if I could just follow up on the previous question, so you got about $10 million, it looks like in price realization on the landfill and I'm just applying the yield growth to the landfill business.

Thanks for taking my questions. Just two questions from me."]], [" And I just wonder whether there\u2019s relief coming or is it just going to spread in terms of pricing, given some of the commentary from before has shifted to where we are today?", ["Okay. So then on the 1% to 3% sales, I want to zero in on the negative 3% in Household this quarter aligned with a zero volume as well.

I think that's what you mentioned, and just want to know how you are thinking about deals and Dollar Trees top line over the balance of the year, and I guess at the crux of the last part of the question is how does your outlook on the health or the spending power of your core customer changed at all?", ["Good morning.

But when it goes into service and you start collecting the actual cash revenues based on the current contract rate, given that the project is coming in at $7.5 billion when the initial service costs was estimated to be in the mid-5s, not that you're alone, there's lots of pipes that are having this issue, shouldn't the return on the pipe unless you're able to negotiate some pass-through of those cost overruns go, that the cash earnings will be lower than the AFUDC rate unless you were able to get contract relief."]], [" I think you said it was less going forward, but I just want to see if you could clarify pursuant to the top line guidance that you provided for 2018 what the benefit is?", ["Thank you very much, and, Keith, congratulations on the appointment.

I guess second question shifting towards from the top line part of the equation to the margin part of the equation. You know you mentioned in your guidance incorporating about a 50 bps margin expansion in '18, similar to the 50 bps you experienced in '17. You know when you kind of look at from the incremental margin, consolidated incremental margin standpoint, you're now a couple of years in a row, if you blend again on a consolidated basis.

I guess, first, Chris as I reflected back on your comments, you gave some pretty encouraging comments on pharma and how you think about pharma as a source of funds in 2018. I wonder if you could give us a sense for where you think pharma lands as a growth driver and the model relative to the long-term trend in the maybe 6%, 7% range.

Or do we get another CapEx increase as we move through the year?", ["Tim, I wonder if you could help, just if you could dig into the CapEx guide just a little bit more, if that's okay.

But even if you just going up call it $10 on that assumption that the 2 billion or so more of CFO and the amount is incremental, buyback here is about $500 million.

Or if there are maybe potential upside opportunities on the productivity side from implementation of the plan?", ["Wanted Rob to come back to the productivity question for a minute and I don't want to minimize the $500 million plus, because it is a big number. When I look over the last three years or so it's sort of been in the range, at least the projection at the beginning of the year has been in the range of anywhere from like $300 million to $400 million plus."]], [" Is that how we should think about 2018, or do you think that could better? Then there was a question asked earlier on Confirm Rx, maybe just setting expectations, could you do, say, $50 million in 2018 on that product? Is that realistic?", ["Good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I\u2019ll just ask two quick product-related questions and drop. CRM, I think you grew about 2% in the fourth quarter."]], [" Can you help bridge that?", ["And then another question on free cash flow. You guys mentioned that when you look at the trailing 12 months, you\u2019ve done $3.1 billion excluding restructuring charges to a reported really impressive number. The street is sitting at -- for this year, sitting at about $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion of free cash."]], [" Essentially, is that due to this being the first quarter where you're completely out of the open pit?", ["Hey. Good morning, everyone. I just want to say, as it's been through the years, it's been great to see the progress made at Grasberg. I appreciate the work gone into that. Couple questions for me, just in the near term. Expectations for the first quarter reflect a pretty big step back in production, step up in per pound costs."]], [" To what extent or potential benefits of some of these key initiatives think into guidance for 2018?", ["Hi, good morning. Thank you for all the color, thank you for taking questions. So I will ask one question two parts. But first off, and it's all financially related really; on a very short term, you are recognizing that fourth quarter sales seem to hit the guidance you weighed out in mid-January. What explains the -- what seems to be a comp slowdown in the month -- I guess since the holiday, so probably in the month of January. Then the second part of the question, longer term, you talk a lot about the initiatives here, we obviously now have guide to 2018."]], [" Now that one of the suppliers actually suggested that market will go 50% next year and it seems like you agree with that, does that make your forecast too conservative now? And if it does become 50% per year going forward and is at a 40%, how do you think about the NAND WFE? How will that change?", ["Well, thanks for taking my question. A couple months ago you guys suggest that the WFE opportunities for NAND would be in the $70 billion over the next five years, and that\u2019s assuming 40% net growth."]], [" My understanding is you acquired another Permian sand mine during the quarter?", ["Paal kind of a separate subject turning gears to the North America, I was wondering if you could just talk, expand a little bit more about your strategy regarding sand and proppant in the U.S. land market."]], [" What do you think is the longer-term trend line that we should be think about Red Hat's revenue growth as we go forward under IBM both maybe on the subscription and services side? And just to kind of level set this, the 14% pretax margin drop or 14 points drop in the cognitive segment, how much of that is just transaction related versus other factors?", ["I guess just on the Red Hat side, it's nice to see the robust 20% growth you guys had this quarter with Red Hat. I think the notable uptick then was Red Hat was in standalone at least."]], [" Given now Refund Advance is completed as of the end of February can you discuss what leverage you have to drive recovery in Assisted growing performance in the second half of the tax season?", ["Hi. Thanks. In the Assisted category H&R Block outperform the industry with more decline volumes for the end of February in large part to Refund Advance."]], [" First on the pension, do we consider that very much a one-off, or is that going to be a future payment?", ["Good afternoon. Given the upcoming Analyst Meeting, I'll ask you just a couple of modeling ones and more specific questions."]], [" But how would you think about the long-term growth rate and the moving parts on that?", [" Because arguably with your exposure to datacenter and cloud, this is probably the business that investors are willing to pay the highest multiple on. But, it\u2019s one that\u2019s over the last several quarters has actually been growing much slower than the other businesses. And I know, there\u2019s a lot of different businesses inside of wired."]], [" How does that affect or how does that change with a 0% tariff? How does that change your mapping if at all in terms of pricing or margin assumptions for 2019?", ["Thank you. My next question just following up on Plumbing from last quarter, I think you mentioned 25% tariffs in your margin mapping, or roughly 80 basis points headwind to the overall business implied in that $45 million headwind from a 25% tariff."]], [" Does that type of return require different strategy than what you are pursuing right now?", ["Yeah, thank you. So Scott, the 4Q guidance implies full year operating margin of about 9.5% if you adjust for the weather in 3Q. By my math, about 3.5 points to that is from selling miles to chase, so why shouldn't I be worried that at 3% GDP and $50, the core airline business is only earning at a 6% EBIT margin."]], [" At some point, do we need to think about the strategy, the structure? Whether it's within Brazil or Europe in terms of your containerboard and Box business there?", ["Hi, everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the details, as always. I had two questions, the first is really on the subject of your non-North American operations, we look at the paper business in, or let me rephrase it, on the one hand, North American paper, we look at the business and recognizing there is a firm amount of freight and maintenance outage burdened this quarter. Nonetheless, you know, generating a million or so of EBIT on the revenue that that segment does, does that suggest perhaps you need to take another look at this business strategically longer term, and then the related question, is getting ahead of myself, you know, when we look at the non-North American packaging businesses, again we see very modest EBIT on relatively large revenue gains."]], [" What\u2019s a reasonable run rate of growth?", [" And then the second question is Frutarom. So I get organic growth for 4Q down about 4%, if you back out the acquisition contribution and the piece of the business from the closing of prior year that you did known for the full quarter, so that gets a full year number down about 1%. So, I guess, the question there is you\u2019ve owned the asset now for a little over one year."]], [" I\u2019m just remembering from previous quarter that you talked about core accrual net interest revenue which would be I think based on the fourth quarter slides, a base of 44 billion?", ["Hi. Good morning. I just had one follow-up question.

I wanted to congratulate you on that unbilled backlog number of $13.3 billion. That's amazing. And maybe it's a two-parter, maybe for Keith."]], [" So one bucket was sort of the discussion of lift and shift continuing to support and build your biggest franchises and then Indra you also mentioned the idea of incubating niche brands or companies within market?", ["Good morning. Thanks. I was curious you had mentioned sort of two different types of comments around brands and innovations."]], [" So what's driving that 4Q weighting in terms of either are certain actions that you expect to kick in or better just productivity from a higher growth number or higher volume number or revenue number? What's driving that 4Q payoff, so to speak?", ["Great, thank you. I guess the second question to shift towards your 2018 margin walk, where you have reduced the net cost benefit for the full year from 125 bps to 75 bps. I think if you look at what you've been able to do so far this year in the first quarter you hit that 75 bps mark, the last couple of quarters it's been more like 25 bps, if I'm looking right on that line item. So it would imply a much stronger number for the fourth quarter, I believe well over \u2013 obviously just the math dictates well over 100 bps, 125 bps of a benefit."]], [" I think at the beginning of the year you've talked about having specific headwind and tailwinds in the 2019 that sort of implied $750 million of cash free cash in 2019?", ["Sorry to keep on this cash flow question but maybe just a little more specific."]], [" So I am curious, does the path even beyond $10 billion and may be to $15 billion or $20 billion in revenue seem any clearer to you as you have these consulting firms coalescing around Salesforce for their digital transformation strategies?", ["Thank you. I'll add my congrats. Question for Marc Benioff. In recent months, we have seen a lot of evidence of the major consulting firms, such as Accenture and Deloitte and PWC, moving pretty aggressively to build out their Salesforce practices. They've been doing it both organically and through acquisitions, and they seem to be centering their entire digital transformation strategy around Salesforce. And we've seen them converging their services with apps from multiple of your app exchange partners and they're kind of wrapping that around Salesforce. And it seems to be resulting, in part, in this growth trajectory that you've got."]], [" But, I\u2019m sort of thinking about the future, and is this less than 1% of revenue growth, sort of a new steady state, just given the supply versus demand technicals? And while it\u2019s not going to be nearly as bad as maybe some fear? Is it fair to say that we are not getting back up to the 2% plus revenue growth that we have seen in the past the like other markets?", ["One, I guess, macro question and then a little bit more micro. Talking about the New York -- the New York market for a moment. Obviously, it seems like, for lack of a better term, the worst case scenario has been taken off the table. And you are a lot more optimistic about New York City than you were previously."]], [" I just want to get a better understanding of why you expect organic sales to get better in Q4? First, is it coming more from developed or emerging markets?", ["Thanks."]], [" First of all, is that the way to look at that?", [" I know you didn\u2019t really change guidance, you said there could be some upside, but how should we think of the cadence of that as some of these price increases work through the system there. And then, maybe drilling down on the traditional sub losses. I guess, we get some -- we understand how NOW is going to continue to moderate given what\u2019s going on with Game of Thrones in HBO. But on the traditional side, we\u2019re using 661 for losses this quarter, given the $117,000 sub adjustment."]], [" What percent of AdWords advertisers are buying Search only versus buying Search and YouTube at this stage?", [" And then second question, on YouTube a lot of discussion here about direct response impact and the opportunity there."]], [" Does that mean that this $50 million to $100 million pretax number could be higher in 2021 and 2022?", ["Going back to the 2020 potential accretion and the earnings potential.

And I think you've reiterated the fact that beyond 2020, you expect this still to be even more accretive."]], [" And here I'm thinking of whether you're planning to reduce the number of doors that you sell through and any thoughts that you might have within doors of where share losses are going to is it other international brand? Is it private label players or any other thoughts around that? And then my second question is just a quick-one on the decision making process around the New York store, and how you'll come to a conclusion on that?", ["Good morning, and thanks so much for taking the questions here. My question is on North America guidance and specifically on North America wholesale. I wonder if you could share with us what level of decline you're embedding within the wholesale segment of North America specifically as you contemplate the down mid to high-single revenues in total, is there any color that you can share with us on the moving pieces within wholesale beyond the declines that you're expecting in off-price."]], [" So just how do you view the sustainability of those margins?", ["When we look at the EBITDA margins in the North American Industrial Packaging business, they have expanded quite significantly this year. I think you said almost 24% in the quarter. I mean how do you think about the sustainability of those margins on a go-forward basis because you did kind of get the added benefit of a price increase early in the year and then as we talked about before, the OCC price dropping."]], [" But if I look into next year, if we do get a margin in the September cut, I mean, how confident are you with those 40% betas on future cuts?", ["Yes, okay. Got it. Thank you. On \u2013 and I guess I want to go back to NII and specifically on deposit betas and deposit prices. It seems like you have good visibility in terms of the betas on the rate cuts for July, September, October."]], [" So anything else you can give us in terms of dynamics of why you maybe felt somewhat less positive? And what actually sort of is playing out in the quarter that turned out to be a really, really strong backlog?", ["Good morning. First some clarification on the backlog, if there's anything you can give in terms of incremental color. So, I guess last quarter, you were sort of like taking your expectations down for this year's backlog. In particular, you were making a fairly bold forecast or assumption of essentially no backlog in the third quarter. Obviously, extremely pleased with your performance this quarter $153 million, but it sort of feels like just incrementally higher volumes wouldn't sort of like explain going from like 0 to like $150 million."]], [" Should we be thinking -- I know you\u2019re not giving guidance, but thinking about kind of a frontend loaded and a stepped up marketing and advertising spend behind that, or is that fairly kind of normal within the kind of normal plans in terms of the launch?", ["Two hopefully quick ones. One on China. The destock seems pretty identical to what happened last year. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand, is this kind of the way you see it going forward with e-commerce growing that we\u2019re going to have kind of a one destock per year, that\u2019s going to affect a given quarter. And then, the second, on Total, on the relaunch."]], [" And then, on the expense synergy on that timing through 2020, can you just give us - just reaffirm sort of that trajectory? And then whether you can - whether you think you can actually accelerate those back office saves given the environment? And then, the walk down of the margin from over 45% to 40% post synergy is that all due to the lower AUM and market conditions?", ["Great. Thanks very much. Maybe just coming back to the one more in the cost saves of the $475 million. Just to get it clarified, I think I may have missed this, I think you think the deal is now closing closer to the later part of the second quarter."]], [" So I guess a few questions is 10% to 12% marketing still the right longer-term zone?", ["Hey guys, thanks for getting me in here. Thanks for all the detail today. I guess, Patrik, as you look past 2020, I have to ask about the comments that you're stepping up the costs on some of the long spending from the long-term drivers like digital and marketing this year and also the CapEx looks like it's rising a little bit."]], [" So first on Starwood, Marriott, obviously had this base of legacy Marriott loyalty members, Starwood loyalty members, and I'm curious kind of what inning you think we're in of increasing share of wallet within those bases of legacy members?

And then related to that, just given the worries around top line, what's your expectation for pulp inflation, raw material inflation over the next 12 months, just given the potential worry here around margins and the company's ability to offset this with FORCE savings and pricing would certainly seem less applicable in the current environment given the competitive activity?", ["Okay.

Can you -- so the first is kind of a housekeeping."]], [" I know that was reduced with the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, but I wonder if you could share with us the rough breakdown of that segment to end markets?", ["Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions here. First question is on the Work business. You\u2019re guiding to 4% to 6% growth in that segment.

So if I understood you correctly than what you're saying is that in memory what you saw three months ago and that led you to tell us you could reasonably expect sequential growth between Q3 and Q4 in semiconductor system, that outlook didn\u2019t change which meant that the low points in memory was Q3 and things should be improving from there based on your visibility today.

You mentioned that in the heavy oil resid market or in the HPC part of the business, whatever, you're looking for a little bit of a better mix in results in 2018 versus 2017.

My question is on North America guidance and specifically on North America wholesale. I wonder if you could share with us what level of decline you're embedding within the wholesale segment of North America specifically as you contemplate the down mid to high-single revenues in total, is there any color that you can share with us on the moving pieces within wholesale beyond the declines that you're expecting in off-price."]], [" But why wouldn't core margins be up, like why are they only flat?", ["Okay.

One is, you've got the $6 million valuation on the customer swap, which was interesting, that's an unusual situation and then you've got the $8 million sitting over there in the particular loan that went bad, which significantly increased provisioning for this particular quarter. Neither of those sound sustainable. And then you've got $3 million of security losses when interest rates are going down, which you shouldn't really have secured.

Nearer term, you're going to see us, of course, leverage the 120 million names that we already have. Looking to drive insights with our merchant teams, we are beginning to leverage some machine learning in terms of driving better allocation of product and better inventory managements overall. Those would be some of the key priorities in addition to what we could do in managing pricing much more dynamically across channels. So a lot of work going on. A lot of testing going on.

First off, with respect to the guidance and recognizing it\u2019s excluding the accretive effects of the Dutch auction, if I look at your individual line items it would seem as though you should be raising guidance, so it looks like your tax rate incrementally might be a $1 benefit, pricing might be an incremental $0.50 benefit, then this is offset by raw material inflation of $0.50 and offset by global volumes of $0.30, that comes to $0.70 all-in unless I am missing something material."]], [" And then just switching gears a little bit, a lot of your public competitors were taking pretty significant market downtime in 4Q, just wondering if you could talk generally about operating rates in the quarter, and if you took sort of similar moves or slowbacks?", ["Good morning.

It's about $1 billion a year at the current rate, and it looks like if I'm doing my numbers right that you are probably three quarters of the way there not that this is how we should look at it, but with the Michigan sale, the last tranche of the variable entity payment next year that gives us $302 million.

And my last question is a little bit of a follow-up on Greg Peters\u2019s question on the expense ratio. If I recall correctly, over the last couple of years a couple of years ago, you guys came out with kind of an improvement in certain expense ratio targets. And I don\u2019t believe you met the target and one of the reasons was because you had decided that it was a good decision not to meet the target because you want to spend more on advertising.

And then, maybe you could talk also about the pricing."]], [" I'm just wondering as you now come into your new role, how you have to think about things differently in that perspective?", [" Hence, I guess, which of these initiatives you're talking about will be the most impactful I guess is a different way to look at it. And then the second question was just on the fact that you came from Taco Bell, which obviously there's lots of laterals, but the one thing that's quite different is Taco Bell being close to 100% franchise model, now you're in a 100% company operated model. Just wondering qualitatively how do you \u2013 how does the approach differ, whether you look at it as just pros and cons to the franchising versus the company operated side."]], [" Can you give us some more color on the database in this quarter, especially for the options?", ["My question is a follow-up to Brad's and Larry, and I think it's more for Mark or may be Larry too. We understand your focus on moving your 50% relational database market share to the Oracle cloud, but that's going to take time for your customers to get there. And until then, they will likely consider to buy for on-premise deployments. This quarter platform and infrastructure grew 1% constant currency and we realized there is headwinds in there from like the middleware business and probably some other things, but more interested in the database. As you say Larry that that's one of the strategic products as that has to be successful here."]], ["65 billion bought, does that impact the full year expectation of $3 billion to $4 billion that you laid out last quarter?", ["Maybe I'll just ask broadly about capital deployment. You're bouncing around now around 40% debt-to-cap. This quarter, you're a little above. Last quarter, you were a little low. It seems like that's probably a good set point. I just want to confirm that for you. And then so if you go forward with your capital from there -- you stepped up the buyback in the quarter. Does -- that $1."]], [" So curious if you could elaborate on the visibility towards that, especially given that some of the back half comps are rather challenging in some of your markets?", ["Thank you. So first off given the Q2 guide, it looks like you're expecting about a 6% organic revenue growth rate in the back half of the year to hit the low end of the 40% range for the total year."]], [" And so on the working capital side, are you assuming the turns get a turn better? Or how should we be thinking about that working capital piece?", ["So just to clarify a couple of points on the cash flow Sue. So obviously nice step-up expected in 2019. You guys are expecting roughly 40% growth. Get the CapEx point, it seems like the delta is \u2013 half of it seems to be coming from working capital improvement half of it coming from earnings growth or EBIT growth, core EBIT growth."]], [" My second question is regarding you are considering the 4% margin in 2020, if we think back to the Indesit acquisition, how much is kind of \u2013 could you isolate some of that shortfall just to the UK in competitive situations there or is there something I heard you say the 8% long-term margin as well, but it seems like it\u2019s getting farther away, so is there something structural that changed within the different countries your \u2013 obviously you lost watch floor space, so your relationships, the retailers was weakened within country which I think is very important, but could you talk about why that seems \u2013 that 8% seems so far away now, so what\u2019s the structural change as it was UK or really IT transition that led to the market share that\u2019s not as quickly recoverable?", ["Thank you."]], [" How \u2013 do you think you\u2019ll reach the normalized level now?

And if you can update us on that metric as well?", ["Hi, good morning. Thank you. So I was just hoping that if you can elaborate more on the top line guidance being, as you said before, on the low end and then embed your comment about 12% growth in investment in A&P in 2019."]], [" What was the impact of this change in channel strategy? Did you see an increase in share? And given how big you are in \u2013 with the Pioneer brand in terms of going direct to growers, you must have a pretty good feel for what actual acres are?", ["Jim, a couple of questions on corn. This was the first year of your new, multichannel strategy in North America in corn."]], [" So just wondering if that comment is indicative of you guys expecting to take a little bit of market share here in 2019 or are you expecting the market growth rate to kind of meaningfully pick up from where it has been the last couple of years?", ["I just wanted to come back to the comments around the $2 billion can production growth in North America in 2019. Just wondering if you could give a sense of how much of that is just replenishing the inventories you drew down in the quarter due to the aluminum sheet issue.

Thank you very much. This question could be for Mark or Safra, I mean obviously the cloud bookings number was very strong and I was wondering if you could just share with us any color on the impact that NetSuite might have had on the growth rate for cloud bookings and also well, I know you are not guiding to fiscal \u201818 cloud or SaaS, PaaS growth, I am just wondering if can share with us, Mark, you commented about having \u2013 doing better and expectation to do better than $2 billion in new cloud ARR, I am just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your confidence level there."]], [" What went so well for you on working capital where there was a real nice swing? What was so negative in other free cash flow?", ["Okay. My last couple, and I'll turn it over quickly. One, on free cash flow, the performance was very strong, at least by your standards even."]], [" How do you feel about the timing of this? Do you really care if it's a June quarter event given that it appears that you've got a lot of large deals in there?", ["Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. It's Chris Donat here. I wanted to ask first on the Closed sales guidance because it implies that your June quarter would be a record quarter of something like $70 million to $110 million. I guess, Rich, what I'm curious about is you sound very confident about it."]], [" Did you know that you had the improvement in Star scores when you put in your bids?", ["Lets me try it a little bit different way. You guys got nice improvement in your Stars scores, moving up 37% of our membership. You put in bids in early June. Here we are in early August."]], [" So, is there something that you haven\u2019t yet disclosed to the street that\u2019s contemplated in that guidance?", ["Second, the other income guidance of $1.7 billion to $2 billion of gains, that seems to imply an asset sale beyond what you\u2019ve already disclosed to the street recognizing that the business that you comment on, that you haven\u2019t executed on yet, is the residual diabetes business."]], [" And given sort of the decline that we've seen since late 2018, can you talk about how that might flow through?", ["Two quick ones for you. One is, I guess pricing mechanisms are a little more opaque in the cellulose fibers business."]], [" So, apologies if I missed it but just if you could highlight some of the drivers there that would be great? My real question is on your biggest brands and what you expect from them in 2020, maybe just a little bit more of a health check, I guess from my perspective Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer, even Mac seemed broadly healthy on a global basis but I love a little bit more from you on how you're viewing them in any pockets of higher opportunity that you see? And then Clinique which sounded like a point of relative optimism at your Investor Day back in March, it just still seems a little bit softer so I'd love to get your views there as well and how you think the contribution of Clinique will compare in 2020 to the year just completed?", ["Hey, great, thanks, good morning. First let me just a bit of housekeeping and follow-up to I think Lauren's question. Leading Beauty Forward charges came in I think 65 million to 80 million higher for the year than what you had guided at the end of the third quarter."]], [" If it does fall short of that goal, can you help us understand what some of the factors might be? What perhaps part of that might be due to TRANZACT transaction costs, which were obviously not known when you provided that guidance initially?", ["Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then I guess it sounds like there's been some questions on that free cash flow that I caught towards the end here. I guess, the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion implies that year-over-year growth rate of maybe 8% to 18%. So it seems like you're possibly going to be below your 15% annual target."]], [" So Ruth, can you just talk about how much of that margin increase year-on-year was from the Hardware business dropping off versus improving elsewhere?", ["Hi. Yes, two questions. The Google segment margin looked really strong in the fourth quarter. I think this is the first time that mix shift actually helped you guys from a margin perspective."]], [" And is $60 million of savings still the right target for this year?", [" And then my second one is just on these savings will you be willing to share kind of the run rate that you are at after 1Q."]], [" In terms of the EPS guidance, can you talk about what the two or three biggest swing factors would be that would get you from the top end of the range to the bottom end of the range, just given that the 7% does seem like the range that\u2019s wider than you\u2019ve historically given? And then, just on the renewals, the $200 million pretax impact, is that just a true-up from renewing the contracts and then that goes back down or is there another step-up beyond 2018?", ["Hey. Good evening, Jeff. I just wanted to ask two quick questions. First, I wanted to bring to you some of the things that you talked about, Jeff."]], [" Is that solely based on price? Or does that actually reflect some level of a decline in overall demand and what might those patients actually be moving toward or moving into as opposed to those rapid-acting agents?", ["Thanks, thanks very much.

And one last quick question. Your acquisition revenue on page five for the fourth quarter, the $116 million that's about $21 million higher than what you guys have provided at that September IR day."]], [" But is that, from a modeling standpoint, as an analyst, that was $22 million, maybe $25 million per quarter is how we'll see that liability going down over the next few years? Is that reasonable?", ["Okay. Second question, I noticed on the queue that regulatory excess deferred taxes, let's say, they were $740 million at the end of your '18 fiscal year. They are now at about $718 million, so a $22 million drop during the quarter. I realize Virginia is not in there yet and I realize every jurisdiction has little different amortization schedule."]], [" How much is the expected improvement is related to a full year of the savings that you've delivered so far versus how much is related to top line drivers like listing growth and favorable mix?", ["Yes, good morning.

Or is it more 3Q?", ["I think the [indiscernible] is the fleet productivity for '20. The credibility of the guide that it can be positive. Jess, can you least take us through a little bit the thoughts on cadence. You mentioned at the early part of the year, it's still a struggle of productivity and it seems that the key metric really is the fleet utilization within that productivity number."]], [" So, based on this curve, do you believe the subcu formulation can also be dosed at two 8-week regimen every two months?", [" And then secondly, I have a question for Martin on the subcu formulation of ALXN1210."]], [" Can you tell us what learnings you're getting from those markets that you could apply to the non-priority markets to get room night growth to accelerate there, or why is room night growth \u2013 what did you do to get room night growth accelerated in those markets? Was that just the lodging procurement? And then that HomeAway EBITDA margin you had in the quarter, that looked pretty positive, is there something that tells you that you want to sustain it at that level? I know you're bouncing as you just talked about growth and profitability there, but do you feel like you've reached, after a lot of investment, a new level there that you could work up from there?", ["Great, thanks. I think, Mark, you mentioned that room night growth accelerated in some of the priority markets."]], [" Could you give us a little bit more color on the Hammerhead appraisals? Obviously, they\u2019re kind of scant detailed in the release, but what does this mean for the potential of, I guess, an accelerated development?", ["Hi thanks. Good morning everybody.

So just to clarify. That's what I was talking about, not the original $150 million. I think in the last call you had mentioned that the PISA limits potentially could result in about $850 million of incremental CapEx excluding the $150 million that's a transfer."]], [" And so I was just trying to see if you could talk a little bit about the flow-through of cars and perhaps it\u2019s related to the shift to non-insurance that Will talked about on the run and drive cars or any explanation or helpful color behind that would be great?", ["Sure. Inventories update and volumes in the subsequent quarter are up 12 and typically maybe it would have been I know it\u2019s never the same every quarter, but they usually will line up over a number of quarters. We have been seeing trends of multiple quarters with the volumes exceeding the inventory, which could imply increased cycle times or I guess decreased cycle times on the lot."]], [" So, did the subcontractor eat the $10 million? And then if you have costs locked-in ahead of time for the developments, was this driven by increased labor costs or did the whole thing just had to be reworked?", ["Yeah. Hi, everyone. Just want to go back to those East Bay developments. I think you mentioned you had a $40 million cost overrun. But when I look at Avalon Public Market and Avalon Walnut Creek, it looks like the cost went up $30 million."]], [" And I know you mentioned the demand part, but that \u2013 a bit better sense for how you were kind of digging in and really getting a higher comfort level that you can hold it given maybe your prior experiences with soft demand?", [" And then secondly, I just want to come back to this pricing point that was just raised. A little more feeling for why you were $30 million to $40 million short, how that affects your timing and thinking of what will be really much more concern than I've got around 2019 versus 2018 as opposed to sort of the rest of this year."]], [" So it feels like there is a lot of work to do, with the $15 million to $20 million kind of one-off assets, and I mean -- is there a risk that some of this could kind of trickle into 2019 at this point? I am just trying to get a sense of, when you think about dispositions, is it -- what's under contract and should we think of it being more sort of first half weighted or how much of that could trickle into the second half of 2018 here?", [" I mean, many of your peers are sort of doing the same thing. It feels like, assets are flooding the market, and you are not getting a lot of -- there isn't much bid for anything sort of over $50 million."]], [" To follow-up on the NII outlook, Eric, I was wondering when you talk about the expected decline next year, can you just give us a little bit more color on just the dynamics of how much and how the lower rates from last year still roll through on the NIM? And also against your point about there being some excess deposits in the system, but you're still growing these deposits from your strategic initiatives, can the balance sheet also expand to continue to expand from here, so I guess just a split dynamic of what happens on the NIM side versus what happens on the balance sheet?", ["Thanks, good morning guys."]], [" I know you talked a lot about those, but is that the totality of the decline in the gross margin? And then, when do you think you can bring these co-packing products into your own manufacturing facility to reduce that cost?", ["Hi, just had a question for you in relation to the gross margin, a couple data points you gave throughout the presentation and discussion, but you had input costs were offset by productivity savings, if I heard correctly. You had obviously some higher inflation, but productivity offset that. You had the DSD and Multipro effect. And the end result was kind of the underlying gross margin being down 70 basis points. What I'm trying to get to is basically the mix effect on those co-packing costs."]], [" So is this something where it\u2019s consistent with spending or expecting, or have been doing and continue to do? Or is this a real step up in your fiber spending?", [" And we were certainly getting a lot of questions about your Corning deal, $1 billion is a big contract.

Finally just in terms of load growth, again in the EEI deck you had load growth of, I think for 2018, 0.7%, which is now down to 0.2% for 2018."]], [" Are there any other factors that we should be thinking about looking ahead to fiscal 2018 beyond the incremental corporate costs, that you would going back to your Q1 commentary characterizes maybe being non-recurring in terms of the benefits that they\u2019ve provided to EBITDA this year?", ["Okay, thanks Tom. And then just on the full year outlook, you see very strong start to the year 30% EBITDA growth and you're looking from \u201918 for the full year. As we think about, I guess one as we think about the sustainability of the progress you\u2019ve been this year and your ability to continue growing EBITDA high-single digits of higher based."]], [" And so curious, as you look at that part of the market, can you talk to your visibility to both greenfield and shrink plants as well as your thoughts around demand elasticity and how you're thinking about spend from that business over the next 5-plus years?", ["I guess, biggest question here is sustainability in memory. And it looks like you're guiding [indiscernible] around $43 billion plus or minus this year. And roughly 70% of that looks like it's coming from NAND."]], [" And then just a follow up here, you know almost exactly a year ago you announced Ayco\u2019s high-profile partnership with Google to provide financial wellness to kind of the entire employee base, I know some of the recent initiatives in the United Capital transaction are going to be synergistic there, is it like David mentioned in the prepared remarks, I'm just curious how you are going to market as you focus more broadly on kind of the full employment employee basis of firms and really whether you are aggressively marketing the platform to some of the larger organizations that I know Goldman has relationships with or if it makes sense to or is there any logic behind trying to connect more into kind of your consumer offering essentially waiting to really push hard so you have a broader platform before you really kind of go through kind of all those relationships that you have on the, at the firm level?

And then secondly, just a follow-up on the synergies."]], [" So I guess my question is, do you argue with that math on where the WFE run rate is for Q4? I'm just trying to see how shipments can't come down here even if the next year is good WFE year?", ["Okay. All right, thanks. And then I guess, Martin, I'm going to try to come at this wafer run rate question a little bit differently. This year if the WFE is going to be $34 billion, which is now what you're saying, you're going to be about 18.5% share, that\u2019s flat despite a very difficult year in DRAM, so that's great for you. But if I use the 18.5% number in your guidance in Q4, it implies that the industry is run rating WFE at roughly $40 billion in the fourth calendar quarter, which is a pretty heavy number."]], [" Just as we roll all that together in terms of the flow through to year-over-year incremental margins, how do you think about that on a normalized basis?", [" And I think early on the call you talked about kind of high level of the impact between fixed costs absorption versus services versus equipment mix."]], [" Can you discuss a little more specifically Applied Materials capital intensity for its class of segment that even with EUV you will continue to see increases for your business segments on a going forward basis for leading edge logic and foundry?", ["Gary, maybe just following up some of the commentary you\u2019ve made about EUV on this conference call, particularly for the leading edge foundry and the increasing litho intensity in the near term.

And do you ever see it weighing on pipeline conversion cycles?", ["Great. Thanks. Keith, one of the things that we commonly heard at Dreamforce is that partners are finding it harder to hire and build up Salesforce, certified resources to meet the demand, which is I guess, especially saying that demand is outstripping supply from a consulting and implementation standpoint."]], [" And just a follow-up on diabetes, another outstanding quarter here best in a decade as you say, again I assume this was as you mentioned 670G driven, but you launched the standalone sensor in mid-June, do we expect this growth to simply continue with these kind of levels given this kind of performance, but if I \u2013 when I reflect on it seems still early in the launch of the Guardian sensor, you highlighted the OUS rollout, why wouldn\u2019t growth actually accelerate from here in Diabetes and maybe just give us a little color on how widely available the Guardian sensor is at this point?", ["Great."]], [" So I wonder if you could comment on whether you have seen any impacts from that and just kind of how that\u2019s playing out in the market?", ["Yes, thanks for the question.

One is Dell/EMC significantly increased their channel program at the beginning of the year, especially focused on storage."]], [" Given the limitations of oral and quad [ph] therapy, is Medtronic in play and how big do you think that market gets?", ["A couple of quick questions for Mike and then one for Omar. So, Mike, your PCR and I was really struck by the net clinical benefit of left atrial appendage closure."]], [" As you think out over the next few years, what are the big cost buckets that you can attack in order to continue to scale your margins as you scale your customer base?", ["Braxton, you talk about the importance of balancing growth in the top line and growth in the bottom line. I was hoping you could talk a bit about where you see the primary levers of driving more operating leverage going forward. So, for example, you're going to spend a little bit more on cost of service this year as you build out 600 megahertz."]], [" Was that the driver of the margin improvement within RIS in the quarter? Or was there some margin improvement also coming from Marsh which did see 3% growth? And then, if we can also just get a little bit of an initial view for January 1 renewals next year?", ["Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on Guy Carpenter, pretty strong organic growth, 11% in the quarter, in your opening comments you guys pointed to kind of broad-based growth throughout.

Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the membership growth. I mean, I'm sure you guys realize this, but you're significantly differentiated from your peers here in the first quarter at least.

So, I guess, maybe trying to tie a number of things that are running through my head together. I guess, last quarter, we talked a lot about the sense of urgency that\u2019s been underpinning the recent initiatives. I think you did a good job at the time communicating that sense of urgency and distinguishing it from panic because that was the word you used. But at the same time, I think we\u2019re now at least eight quarters into what has seemingly been a pattern of organic growth and gross margin pressures. So, I guess, the question is, if we strip away the macro challenges, which I acknowledge are severe, but is the message underneath at all that from here, you think Colgate needs to be more urgent, or is there a risk that recent urgency whether it\u2019s the push into e-commerce, the catch-up on premiumization et cetera."]], [" Is it such that you think volumes are actually down year-on-year in the back half either company-wide or at least in the Fragrance? And if so, is it just \u2013 is it just comp or is there anything on win rates or customer order patterns that would make you think that?", ["Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a clarification on the guidance, a lot of ground covered today. There is a pretty sharp deceleration implied in second half currency neutral sales growth and understanding the comps get considerably tougher, especially in Fragrance, but you've got better pricing expected to flow through."]], [" So perhaps, outside of corporate, what's really changed since you've owned this asset?", ["I promise I'm yelling. So in terms of Esterline, you guys target 20% returns, which means 22% EBITDA margins. I mean just going back to it, and I apologize I'm parsing this apart, but you strip out the corporate from Q2 2018 EBITDA and margins are still up 700 basis points to 800 basis points year-over-year. I get it you've only owned it for 17 days."]], [" So how quickly and maybe what is the cadence look like for an improvement in sales as the sales force is now integrated and hopefully more stable to offset some of these dis-synergies?", [" I think you've suggested that the integration of the Oppenheimer and Invesco sales forces was particularly disruptive. We've got three months of Oppenheimer in 3Q rather than 1Q."]], [" First of all, in terms of the rate increases on the primary inside and it\u2019s not just for you, but others, to what extent are broadly discussed industry price increases going to get mitigated by higher outwards reinsurance costs, which you guys will benefit from? And two, in absence of property pricing being up, I\u2019m sure in your non-property lines, you had all seen price increases, but would it be business as usual or is there really something palpable going on outside of the property-driven pricing markets?", ["I want to talk a little bit about pricing, obviously, both sides of the markets."]], [" Can you maybe quantify those? Are you talking about auto production down 10% like what is smartphone assumptions, what TV unit assumptions, that would be helpful?", [" And a quick follow-up to your comment about China end market assumptions being conservative."]], [" Is this something that we should expect to happen for a year and then kind of normalize back to pretty steady pace of deleverage? Or is this -- are we over some critical threshold, and we should see this trend of moderating deleverage continue for several years into the future?", [" And then, Ruth, a question on sites TAC. So I know you said the pace of deleverage is going to start to improve next quarter."]], [" Any help on what those share cost mix is between the various products would be helpful? Any color on that? And then just very simply on Comcast has the best broadband offering in terms of speeds and capabilities, but if we price that product lower, would subscribers be higher, in the sense is there a real elasticity for subscriber growth if you price your product lower?", ["Thanks. I'm going to \u2013 I think it's for Dave. I think one of the key things that we're trying to figure out, obviously, we know that broadband margins on a contribution basis is higher, but there's a lot of shared cost below across multiple products, but when you start to look at truck rolls and what the main reasons for that are and the calls coming in, what the main reasons for that are. So we had to sort of disaggregate the product that's been bundled unfortunately that's what we're trying to do."]], [" But I'm wondering, even if let's say the initiative doesn't pass and Commissioner Tobin's Energy Plan goes through and there is a more measured pace of renewable expansion for the next decade, how much incremental capital do you think would be possible for you to absorb or you to win as part of the rate base growth profile for the next decade?", ["So, you indicated that if the initiative passes that it would require over $10 billion of incremental capital investment by 2030 and that that can lead to substantial increase in customer bills. It is why you are opposing this method of getting to those kinds of goals."]], [" I just wanted to kind of confirm, is the $15 billion debt target subject to being revisited or is that pretty much a hard number?", ["Thanks, good morning. Don, I was hoping to go back to Phil's question on uses of cash flow."]], [" So is that just kind of some level of conservatism? Is there \u2013 is it just the impact of the hurricane to the current quarter, or is there anything else in the underlying business that we should be thinking about that might take payroll to the lower-end of the 1% to 2% range versus the higher?", ["That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And maybe as a follow-up, on the guidance, I don\u2019t want to get too nitpicky here. But if I just take the midpoint of both your payroll and HRS ranges and add the impact from float, I get a revenue total number that\u2019s a little bit closer to 7% than it is to 6%."]], [" As we go through 2018 and 2019 is a preference to spend that cash on developing projects, or is there also thoughts towards giving some of that back to the shareholders?", ["Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just stepping back for a minute. Obviously, the balance sheet significantly better than it was. Stabilization in Indonesia, at least, seems to be heading in right direction. And it\u2019s like quite a bit of free cash flow generation potential. Way back when the management team, the Board did payout this free cash flow dividends, special dividends, pretty big one at points. And obviously, on this call, your opening remarks are really more focused on highlighting the project. So I have a high-class problem type of question."]], [" But should we be thinking more of what we've seen so far? Like a number of smaller growth year acquisitions to help you leverage your current capacity and supply chain? Or you're potentially open to whatever great value, big or small?", ["Okay, great. And then just a quick follow up on balance sheet, M&A, buy back. I know you virtually said $1 billion ASR for the year, I'm assuming that's on track or you're on track to complete that to Q4 would be the balance of what's left. That's one; and two, just leverage now was trailing 12 months is about four quarters is about 1.5x net debt. As we think forward into acquisitions, I know you want them to be value-added ROIC creative, etcetera."]], ["20, is part of that the increased earnings power from not having bonus depreciation in '18 and beyond and the resultant increase in earnings power at the utility?", ["So just a follow-up question and then a new question. On the - your earnings were up 9%, the $0.65 that Steve Fleishman articulated, with $0.45 from tax. If I'm just thinking about the components of the other $0."]], [" The drag from freight that you mentioned in the quarter, is that fairly consistent in the guidance in the balance of the year in terms of the year-over-year drag you are expecting in the balance of the year? And then on the beer pricing front, are you guys looking to perhaps be more aggressive with pricing given the rise you are seeing in transportation costs or do you look at it really more from a competitive standpoint in consumer demand elasticity than being tied to cost spikes?", ["Hi, guys. So, first just a couple of follow-ups."]], [" Patrick, could you just speak to the 4 points of inorganic growth that you forecast for 2020?", ["Yes. Good morning."]], ["10 increase in the full-year guidance?", ["Okay. So following up on that, and just trying to think through the changes in your EPS guidance, based on my math it looks like less worse FX is about $0.10. You're guiding to slightly lower tax rate, which is about maybe $0.15. And then you previously assumed that the tariffs would jump to 25% as of January 1, which obviously hasn't happened yet. So that's some extra earnings here in the first quarter versus what you might have been thinking three months ago, so just trying to put those pieces together and then get to the only $0."]], [" Where exactly is this supply coming from and why has it proven easier, if this is the case, for larger manufacturers to bring this online?", ["Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I would have two, please. The first is on the evolution of the lithium demand forecast that you set out at the start of your presentation. I think the guidance over the last two years has been that the lithium market is broadly imbalanced, which would imply that the upward revisions to demand have been matched by increases in supply."]], [" So, any sort of commentary you can give there?", ["Thanks. Hello everyone. So, I wanted to follow-up first on the free cash flow question. So, I guess, how should we think about free cash flow generation given obviously what happened in fiscal 2018 and I think roughly $340 million delta between accrued and paid costs through year-end fiscal 2018. So, should we expect another year of free cash flow approaching zero in fiscal 2019, should it improve even if not back to fiscal 2017 level."]], [" Can you highlight maybe any other moving pieces to think about as we move from cash flow in 2017 to 2018?", ["Thanks very much. Bruce, I guess, I'll maybe keep you on your toes a little bit. In terms of the cash guide for this year at that $6.2 billion and thinking about the pension headwind, but if the pension contribution is offset a little bit by higher CAS and then you think about it after tax, it seems like maybe it should be about $1 billion headwind all in. And then maybe there's still a few $100 million of Sikorsky working capital relief."]], [" So, it sounds like this time around, it had a greater impact on sales, why do you think that was?", [" Second, you did offer free delivery earlier in the year."]]]
