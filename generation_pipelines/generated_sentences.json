Thanks.</s>", "</s><s>The only thing I would point out today is that Schnitzer has been very public about his desire to reduce the amount of power that he has over the course of his career. And I think that's what's really driving this. Schnitzer is a very public person. I think he used to say that he'd be very interested in dealing with the issues of control over the media. But over the last couple of years, we've seen a shift in the way he treated the media and the media towards reporting on things outside of the control of the government. And that's something that I think is very important for Schnitzer and for those of us who follow him on the Internet. We've watched him interact with the media a lot, and he's very public and very open about what he thinks is important for the free press and for the people. So I'd just love your perspective on that.</s>", "</s><s>The only thing I can tell about Schnitzer is that he was very fond of working with Schnitzer during his tenure as Schnitzer was working with him on the Schnitzer case. Schnitzer worked with us on several different fronts during the year. For example, one was to train Schnitzer on how to train and train the cadence of the new airplanes. We were working with Sasan and others on a number of different fronts. And Schnitzer and others were working on different aspects of Schnitzer's portfolio. We worked with them on various fronts. We train them on different types of airplanes. And we train them all on different shifts during the week. And they all worked very closely with us over the course of the year to train our cadence. And that's how we train our new train crews.</s>", "</s><s>The question is how do we think about Schnitzer's ability to continue to manage Schnitzer\u2019s business? You know, Schnitzer has always treated Schnitzer fairly well, but there's been a lot of questions on Schnitzer and how do you balance that with the demands for change in the labor market? Do you think Schnitzer can kind of keep pace with Schnitzer? And if so, what level of pressure do you expect Schnitzer to push through in terms of reducing the amount of contracts that Schnitzer must deal with?</s>", "</s><s>The only thing I can tell about Schnitzer is that he was very fond of working with Schnitzer during his tenure as Schnitzer was working with him on the Schnitzer Project. Schnitzer worked with us over the course of the year to train and train the cadence of our train crews and train them for different shifts during the week. And I think that was one of the things that really stuck out to me was when we first met Schnitzer and he was working together on a project to train the train crews for a certain period of time after Schnitzer left to go to work for a company that was based in the United States. We were working with Sasan and others over the years to train train train our train cadence for the next year or two. And that's what we've been doing over the last year or so.

We\u2019ve been working with him for a while now to get to the point where we can start to see the results that we\u2019re looking for in the business. Schnitzer, on the other hand, has been very helpful to us in terms of getting to know our customers and getting them to understand what is going on with their expectations for Schnitzer and what kind of changes are going to have to be made to their expectations over the course of the year?

And I think Schnitzer also worked with him on many of the things that Schnitzer has done over the years. For example, Schnitzer worked with us on several of the projects that we've been working on over the course of the year. Some of those projects are very ambitious and we're looking forward to continuing to work with him over the next couple of years to continue to advance Schnitzer's goals. But at the same time, we're also looking at ways to increase our exposure to Schnitzer\u2019s observations and observations on the quality of the data that he provides to us and to those of our guests. And Schnitzer, for example, has been working with us over the last several years to improve our ability to tell the stories of how Schnitzer and Schnitzer treated those individuals and their families and to improve their trust in us over those entrusted tasks.

Schnitzer has been very public about what he thinks of Schnitzer\u2019s business model and what he sees as the most important thing for Schnitzer and for the company. And I think Schnitzer even said that Schnitzer would be very interested in working with us on a number of fronts. For example, on the energy side, we've been working with Sasan for quite some time now to get to a point where we can start to combine the energy of the two companies in terms of generating a sustainable growth rate for our company.

But what I\u2019m really concerned about is the amount of data that he\u2019ll give us is how much of it is going to go into the public domain versus what he told us at the beginning of the year. And what I would tell you is that when we talk to the media about this is that the media is focusing on this issue. And we\u2019ve been hearing about this for quite some time, and it\u2019d be fair to say that the news media is focused on it. But when we look at the data that we have across all the news sources, the media has been focusing on Schnitzer, the only thing that I would say about the news organization is that there is not a whole lot of coverage about this issue at this particular time. And so I think the media focus is on it, and what\u2019\ufffds happening in the news reports today is that news organizations are focusing more on things other than just the news cycle, which is what we think is important for the news organizations and for the people around us, and that is what matters to us. The media focus has been on the media, and I think this is a very important issue for the media. But I don't think there is a news organization that has ever treated the media the way that we used to treat our news reports. And the media reports have been very critical of the media coverage of Schnitzer and the government over the last year and a half, and the media report has been critical of him for that. But the media stories about him are very important for us and for those of us who know Schnitzer very well. So I just wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more detail on what's going on in the media and what's happening with the government. And you mentioned that there's a lot of things going on, whether it's the government shutdown or things like that. And that's why I think it's important to understand what is happening in this news cycle and to the extent that we can debate with the media what is the appropriate level of coverage for this news organization and what it is for the state of the union, for the sake of our democracy, for our democracy and for our freedom? For example, what are the things that we should be watching for in terms of news organizations that are important for our news organizations to report to us in the interest of protecting our independence from news organizations like the media in the United States?

We've always treated Schnitzer like a little bit of an expert on the Schnitzer business. And we've watched him do some really interesting things around Schnitzer over the years. For example, when we look at Schnitzer\u2019s business model in terms of the amount of free cash flow generation that Schnitzer can generate, how much of that is going to go towards the dividend versus the dividend?

These are the things that we're trying to prevent. These things are things that are supposed to be going to be phased in over the course of the year. And then there's also things that would be taking place in other parts of the world where there's not as much enforcement as we've seen in the U.S. and Europe.

So, I guess, if you look at the variance between quarters on a year-over-year basis, it seems pretty consistent with what you\u2019ve been saying for the last several quarters. And I guess I\u2019m trying to understand why you wouldn\u2019t be able to be more specific to the year, because you seem to have a lot of things going on in the business that are kind of out of whack with your expectations for the year.

I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of that is being driven by capital return versus share repurchase?

If you look at the fourth quarter, which was pretty good, but then you had a slowdown in the first half, it was down 15%, and then you were up 15% in the second half.

I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on how much of that growth is coming from wells that are under construction versus wells that were laid out at the Analyst Day.

Can you give us a sense of how much of that is being driven by product mix shift? And then, secondly, if you look at your guidance for fiscal 2020, it looks like you're going to be at the lower end of that, which would imply that you need to invest about $1 billion or more to get to your full-year EPS guidance.

And then, secondly, as you look out to the second half of the year, should we expect that we\u2019ll see a step-up in the sort of CapEx spend as we move into the back half of this year? Thanks.</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then, Chris, I wanted to follow-up on some of the commentary you've made about the churn being a little bit more negative in the first couple of quarters. You talked about the impact of the All-digital drives. Is that something that we should expect in the second half of this year? Or is it something that you think you can kind of offset with sort of the cost reductions that you've been seeing in the back half of the year?</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the $20 billion organic capital spending target. Just wanted to make sure I understood that correctly. So, if I heard you right, you're not saying that you're going to be able to win in any environment. You're saying that there is a lot of opportunities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

And I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that is going to fall into the bottom end of that range versus the higher end of your long-term target?</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up on free cash flow. You\u2019re expecting a $1.5 billion to $2 billion increase in net debt over the next couple of years. Just wanted to get a sense of how you are thinking about the sustainability of that level of net debt. And I know you don\u2019t want to get too far ahead of yourself on that, but just wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more color on what you are expecting in terms of the cadence of your net debt-to-EBITDA growth over the year.</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then just a follow-up on the Midland Delaware Basin takeaway capacity. I think you mentioned that you had 50,000 barrels a day of excess capacity in the second half of this year.

And then also, if you could provide a little bit more color on the timing of when you would expect that excess capacity to fully be realized? Thank you.</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then just a follow-up on the free cash flow guidance. You talked about having firm dock capacity in the Midland basin.

So, if you look at the $5 billion to $10 billion EBITDA target that you laid out at the Analyst Day, it looks like you\u2019re going to be closer to $50 million to $60 million of net proceeds. Can you give us a sense of how much of that is attributable to the Elk Hills Field sale and how much is related to the ability to get to the three-year target?</s>", "</s><s>Okay, great.

You\u2019ve got the $225 million to $500 million of growth in the first quarter, but then you have the step-down in realizations and then you get back to the 4% to 5% growth rate. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how much of that is being driven by higher realizations versus lower operating expenses?</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then just a follow-up on the cash flow guidance. So, if I look at the $2.1 billion to $3.2 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter, it\u2019s obviously a lot higher than what you\u2019ve been doing in the second half. And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how much of that is related to the timing of the JV partner payments? And then, if you could just talk a little bit about what you think is the potential impact of those timing payments?</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then just a follow-up on the free cash flow guidance. So, if I look at slide 13, where you talk about the $20 to $30 per barrel EBITDA guidance for 2018, I'm assuming that includes the $10 to $12 decline in unit costs and the $0.10 in cost saves. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that is being driven by the fact that you're going to be able to offset some of the inflationary pressures that you've experienced in the past year, and how much is being offset by the cost savings that you expect to see in the back half of the year?</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then, just on the Permian, if I look at the current value of the portfolio, it's $50,000 to $60,000 an acre, $20,000 a acre is a pretty good spread between what you're saying today and what you've said previously.

So I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that is being offset by the fact that you did not have a dividend in the first quarter, and how much is actually going to be reinvested back in the business in the second half versus the first half?</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then just a follow-up on the free cash flow guidance. If we look at the midpoint of that range, it seems like you're guiding to $60 million to $70 million of free cash, which would imply a pretty significant step up in free cash. I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that is related to the asset sales that you've been doing in the first quarter versus what you did in the second quarter? And then I have a follow up on the affiliate dividends.

I'm just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what's going on there, where you're seeing the most activity in that market square square footage? And also, how you're thinking about the amount of development and redevelopment that you're looking at there?</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then just a follow-up on the guidance; I think you had said previously that there was a lot of moving parts in terms of the forward equity sales contracts that you expect to settle later this year. So I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on how much of those were moving parts? And then also, I think it was $95 million of net debt maturities this year, so just a little color on what's going on there.</s>", "</s><s>Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on the balance sheet; I think you had $95 million of net debt outstanding at the end of this year and you've got about $1 billion of forward equity sales contracts that you expect to settle later this year. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that is being used to fund strategic growth?</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then just one follow-up on the guidance. So, if I look at your guidance for the year-end, it looks like you're guiding to a mid-single-digit growth on top of that, which is consistent with what you've been saying for the last couple of years. And I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that is coming from new leasing that you're doing in the back half of the year versus what you were doing at the end of '18?</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then just a follow-up on the leasing activity in the quarter. I think you had a pretty good quarter in terms of leasing activity and leasing activity. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on where you're seeing leasing activity trends in leasing activity across the U.S. on a comparable basis versus the same time last year?</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then just one follow-up on early renewals. If I look at the midpoint of your leasing guidance, you've got a pretty high percentage of leasing expirations that are going to be in the 20% to 30% range, which is pretty consistent with what you've been saying at the Analyst Day. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that is coming from leasing versus leasing? And then, if you could just give us a little bit more color on the timing of that expiration?</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then, just a follow-up on the balance sheet. You've got a lot of stabilized cash here in the quarter, but you've got some unencumbered assets that are going to go up over the next couple of years. So, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on where you think you're going to land in terms of how you're thinking about your balance sheet today versus a year ago?</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then just a follow-up on the San Francisco office market, I think you guys had a pretty good quarter in terms of leasing activity in that market. You talked about a lot of the key markets that you're competing in there. I'm just curious how you're thinking about leasing activity there relative to the broader U.S. biotech market. And I know you've talked a lot about San Francisco being a key market for you, but how are you thinking about the balance of your portfolio there? And is this a year where you're looking to expand into other markets? Or is this more of a year-over-year type of leasing? Thanks.</s>", "</s><s>Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of follow-ups on the guidance. First, can you give us a sense of the magnitude of the change in the U.S. patent approval for Ultomiris? And then, secondly, on the outlook for the guidance for calendar '19, is this a year where you expect to see a meaningful reduction in the number of patents that you have in the portfolio? And how should we think about the timing of that? Thank you very much.</s>", "</s><s>Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of follow-ups. First, can you give us a sense of the magnitude of the U.S. patent approval for Soliris in NMOSD? And then, secondly, on Ultomiris, you're going to be filing for a non-inferiority license in the fourth quarter. Can you tell us how many patents have been recently approved for this product? And is there any way you can give us an idea of how many trials are currently under way in that market? Thank you.</s>", "</s><s>Thanks for taking my question. Just two, if I may. First, just on the revenue guidance for the year, can you just give us a sense of how much of that is coming from new markets versus existing markets? And then, secondly, on the change in the non-inferiority profile for Strensiq, is that something that we should expect to see in the second half of the year? Thanks.</s>", "</s><s>Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up on one of the questions on the market. It seems like a lot of your primary care physicians are using one device per year for their primary care. And I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of how many primary care doctors are using OneSource per year. And then, also, if you can give us an update on the profile of those physicians, is that a patient population that you're seeing in PNH or aHUS or is that more of a general neurologist? Thanks.</s>", "</s><s>Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a little bit about Alexion. So, first, can you give us a sense of how far behind you are in the development of this product? And then, secondly, how much more traction do you have with the FDA on this new formulation? And is it safe to assume that you'll be able to market this product to a broader number of end markets? Thank you very much.</s>", "</s><s>Great. Thank you very much. Just two quick questions. First, Joe, I wanted to go back to the Ortho and GPs outlook for the fourth quarter. It sounds like you're expecting a step up in the number of procedures that you're doing in the third quarter. Is that the right way to think about it? And then Joe, can you just give us a little bit of a sense of what you're seeing in the orthopedics side of the business? I mean, you've got a lot of momentum in Ortho, but what are you seeing in terms of the kind of new programs that are driving that? Thanks.</s>", "</s><s>Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just two, if I may. First, can you just talk a little bit about the growth rate you're seeing in Invisalign First and Ortho First? I think you had a pretty good quarter in terms of growth rate in the teen and adult markets. Is that a function of more sales force adds in the fourth quarter? And then, secondly, just kind of thinking about North America orthodontics in general, how much of that growth is coming from North America versus Europe or is it more coming from China or other markets? Thanks.</s>", "</s><s>Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just two, if I could. First, can you just talk a little bit about the growth in China in terms of the number of China patients that you're seeing in the China market? And then, secondly, just on China, I think you mentioned that there's a lot of growth there, but how much of that growth is coming from China? Do you think that's going to be enough to offset some of the headwinds that you've seen in China? Thanks.</s>", "</s><s>Thank you. Good morning everyone.</s>", "</s><s>Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, if I could just follow up on some of the earlier questions on the duration of your duration contracts. If I look at the current duration contracts, they're up year-to-date. And I'm just trying to figure out how much of that is going to be tied to the duration contracts that you're going to begin to lengthen those contracts?</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then just a follow-up on the Allstate side. If I look at the trailing 12 months, it looks like Allstate had about $1.9 billion of policies in force and that's about a third of Allstate's overall insurance revenue. So, is that the right way to think about it? And then, if you look at what's going on with the insurance policy side of the business, is it safe to assume that that's going to continue to be a pretty significant growth driver for Allstate going forward?</s>", "</s><s>Okay. And then, just a follow-up on the underlying combined ratio. So, if I look at the fourth quarter performance, it looks like it was up about 100 basis points year-over-year. It was down about 200 basis points. And I think that's mostly related to the reinsurance business. So I guess, I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of how much of that was related to Allstate brand auto insurance and maybe some of the other line items that you called out in the prepared remarks.</s>", "</s><s>Great. Thank you very much. Two questions, if I may. First, Google Cloud Platforms grew a little over $10 billion in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about how much of that growth was driven by mix shift versus other Bets? And then, Ruth, on YouTube, clearly, a lot of focus on balancing profitability and ad relevance.
