"Do you want to share a little more on your thought process here, is it the (25:29) market, pricing, timing, the opportunities in jurisdiction. What were some of the real major thrusts to bring this all together and has this been on the plate for a while or did it happen recently, just a little more color towards the thought process here with Galore? ",Clarification,Product,Progress
"As we look towards your reserve profile next year, where are some of the opportunities you're seeing some better results and more exciting results to help us achieve those goals? ",Clarification,Product,Progress
"And finally, Gary, as you assess cost pressures as you highlighted, have they accelerated from first quarter or from what you had anticipated a year ago, are they abating and where are maybe one or two areas that are really – I'm sure it's more regional than not, but that is more difficult to offset from Full Potential? ",Presupposed,Product, progress
"I know it's early stage, but would you be sort of likely to be dribbling capital into that to shorten the development program and make it easier to make a decision when the copper price and the markets are receptive?",Presupposed,Management,Market
"Just going over to Ahafo, so you're now pushing the commercial startup, it looks like it would be delayed by as much as a quarter given unfortunately the circumstances early this year. But the CapEx is maintained for 2018. Can you see some sliding of the CapEx from 2018 into 2019?",Clarification,Management,Asset
And you're thinking we should be looking at commercial production more in Q4 of next year than in Q3 or Q2? ,Clarification,Product,Growth
"All right. To Kalgoorlie, so guidance this year down 70,000 ounces impact into next year as a consequence of that east wall slip. Can you just walk us through what the implications are for the mining with, I presume, a restricted footprint of access and remedial work, and what it means for the layback of Morrison and the timing of that? ",Clarification,ESG,Footprint
"The strip CapEx there was going to be about $125 million spread over a number of years, 2018 through to 2025 basically and getting production access to Morrison in 2019. Should we be pushing that out by a year or two do you think? ",Clarification,Product,Cost
"Thank you. And just a follow-up on David's question if I might, maybe is it reasonable to look at KCGM as for the next couple of years, anyway is maintaining sort of your share of production at the 280,000 to 300,000 ounce a year range that is looking at the stockpiles, lower grades and the other sources of work to basically sustain that at these levels. Is that a safe assumption when we look at our model for KCGM? ",Clarification,Product,Profit
"Thank you. And then just a separate question on CC&V. Tom, you made the reference to that you shipped about 17,000 tonnes (sic) [ounces] of con to the Carlin plant. I guess the question is on a quarterly run rate basis, what should we assume and is that concentrating – is that concentrate displacing roaster ore as it is a lower grade roaster ore and should we see an improvement in what comes out of the roasters in Carlin as you ship more material from CC&V?",Clarification,Product,Improvement
" Perfect. And then presumably extend that into 2019, 2020 as well? ",Clarification,Product,Progress
"Okay. Good morning, everybody. I guess David asked my questions on the Morrison layback, and just to make sure I understood, so by year-end, we will have some sort of an idea when you put out your guidance, I guess, in December. What the sort of smaller Morrison layback looks like just with the – getting back to the ramp access that you right now don't have, is that a clear – am I understanding it correctly?",Presupposed,ESG,Access
Okay. So is it safe to say that it's been a year that you've been working on this and you've looked at all of the studies out there and somewhere between looking at the studies and valuation on per ounce in the ground is how you came up with your purchase price for unstaged (43:01) payments?,Presupposed,Finance,Acquisition
"Okay. And then just coming back to Akyem, I noticed that you put a press release on your website with regards to some contention with farmers around the area and some compensation. Can you just give us an update of what's exactly happening there? ",Challenge,ESG,Access
And when is the mediation? Do you have a timeline for the mediation process? ,Clarification,ESG,Compensation
"So besides the peaceful demonstration that you had the other day, is that really the only sort of demonstration you've had on this site with respect to these farmers and their crops?",Challenge,ESG,Compensation
Okay. And we've seen nothing like this at Ahafo in that area? ,Challenge,ESG,Compensation
"Hi, Gary. Maybe a question for yourself; and Randy, just coming back to Galore again, I know there's been a few questions, but I still haven't quite heard from you because here's a project that Teck basically mothballed many years ago, never heard much about it and then now it's come back to life again. Just wondering where Teck – or sorry, Newmont, I guess Teck also, see the opportunity to improve the economics of the project that could lead to a positive feasibility studies or attractive returns, I guess, that's what I was wondering.",Clarification,Product,Profit
"Okay. Does this kind of signifies Newmont's acquisition strategy, focusing on more longer term development projects rather than assets in production? ",Presupposed,Finance,Acquisition
"Yes, thank you. Gary, are you getting a better sense around the Chaquicocha Oxides and how that fits in between now and Yanacocha Sulfides and how that fits in potentially with Quecher Main ?",Clarification,Produc,Progress
"Hey, good morning, everybody, and thank you for taking my question. Not to belabor Galore Creek too much, but obviously over the last few years there has been a tremendous amount of uncertainty caused by resource nationalism and obviously Galore Creek safe jurisdiction in British Columbia. To what extent did that play a role in evaluation of this asset and the strategic decision to invest there? ",Clarification,ESG,Access
"Got it. Thank you. And then on Galore Creek, do you think that the project is more valuable with Teck as a partner or do you think it could maybe make sense for you to go ahead by yourselves?",Presupposed,Management,Corporation
