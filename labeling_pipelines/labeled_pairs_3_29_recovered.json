I will also highlight our recent success leveraging the expertise of our PowerAdvocate business and to the extent of Wood Mackenzie energy and mining customer base. And lastly, we'll give you an update on the customer response to Lens, Wood Mackenzie's new data analytic platform. Regarding the macro environment. As you are aware, the oil and gas industry has been through a very challenging time over the last few years due to the falling oil prices. However, the industry in 2019 is in a much better shape than it was prior to the oil price crash in 2015. The oil and gas industry responded with amazing speed and focus to the drop in oil prices, aggressively cutting costs and rebuilding balance sheets, divesting noncore assets, which allowed them to concentrate upon low-cost, long life things. In turn, free cash flow has become the key financial metric. Indeed, in 2018, free cash flow surpassed the previous peak seen in 2012 when oil prices were above $100 a barrel. In summary, our oil and gas customers are in robust health with their focus now returning to new investments. We estimate future capital investment will exceed $200 billion in the next few years. As a result, we believe the majors will deliver stronger production growth in the coming 5 years, are poised to recover stronger growth for 5 years down the pre-oil price crash. Simultaneously, our downstream and finance platforms team continued strong demand, particularly in emerging markets leading to new investment in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Our core energy customers are also grappling with opportunities and challenges presented by climate change and the need for an energy transition to lower carbon energy sources. As you are aware, we have established 2 breakout businesses to specially support and advise our customers in these areas, namely chemicals and power and renewables. The chemicals business continues to deliver strong double-digit growth as customers recognize that the primary driver of oil demand is likely to become chemical demand over the medium and long term.

The single most important reflection of our vitality is our rate of organic revenue growth and normalizing for the effects of exceptional storm-related revenues and a significant contract signing in Financial Services in 2017. Our organic constant currency revenue growth was 7.2%, ahead of our long-term financial target of 7%. Moreover, our growth was broadly based across our Insurance vertical, along with Wood Mackenzie in the Energy space and our core consortium, data analytics in the Financial Services vertical. The heart of our position in the three verticals is sound and forms the basis for cross-selling new solutions in the future."

And relatedly on the incremental investments side of things these were described as accelerated programs in the release.

And then on the Argus -- or financial services organic outlook, I think there was a moment at the Investor Day where there's a question about should 2018 be an outsized growth year. And I think, Scott, you said it was your expectation, that Nana was nodding his head yes. And then there was a comment today about, I think, a grow-over effect from the onetime revenue in '17 as in -- a large new client comes online.

I see progress on all fronts. And over the last 90 days, I'm particularly struck by our growing effectiveness in overseas markets, particularly the U.K. As a result, our organic revenue growth in the quarter was 7.6%, consistent with our longer-term goals. Our rate of organic EBITDA growth in the quarter was about 5%, lower than revenue growth and a function, particularly, of the significant investment we made in Geomni as we continue to ramp up that operation. In 2018, I expect that relationship to be reversed, meaning enterprise organic EBITDA growth greater than organic revenue growth."

During your remarks you talked about a step-up investments in the business services segment to drive growth in the future.

During the year, we produced 64 shows for 12 different buyers from the world of broadcast, cable and streaming. This expanded slate of programming is being monetized across platforms and around the globe, resulting in growing content license fees. Just yesterday, we announced a multiyear deal with Amazon to license The Good Wife in Europe, Asia and Latin America, representing a whole new opportunity to take content we launched on All Access here in the U.S. and license it internationally. And the second positive development is that we\u2019re seeing extremely strong growth in scatter pricing across all day part, up nearly 40% in primetime, daytime and late night. Plus as more and more viewing happens on digital platforms, we\u2019re just beginning to benefit from better CPMs as a result of more targeted digital advertising. So, whether it\u2019s launching new direct-to-consumer services, negotiating with distributors, licensing our content around the world or selling into advertises across platforms, we are operating from a position of great strength, thanks to the size of our audience and the demand for our content."

When you look at the numbers that have been announced or pre-announced as it relates to losses during the third quarter and again you looked at the projected whole, the parts are not equaling the whole. Obviously, there could be a couple of different reasons for this. One is that it will turn out the projected whole turning out to be something less than expected; number two, alternative capital and other market participants that have not announced, it\u2019s going to prove that they have more exposure than perhaps some people had originally expected; or number three, many market participants are just proven to be more optimistic than will prove to be reality.

The contract adjustments reflect higher than expected cost on certain existing projects and were included in the cost-of-sales line. With these contract adjustments, we've completed the review of our project portfolio and believe our U.S. and this reflects the reality of the current status for these projects. If you exclude the contract adjustments, and restructuring expenses, operating income was $133 million or about 12.4% of sales.

Lower Cable results were driven by a decline at ESPN where higher affiliate revenue was more than offset by an increase in programming and production expenses and a decrease in advertising revenue. Growth in ESPN's programming costs was due to our new NBA agreement and contractual rate increases for NFL programming, partially offset by lower programming costs for College Football due to the timing of the College Football Playoff relative to our fiscal calendar. As you know, this year, ESPN aired only three of the New Year's Six bowl games during the first quarter, whereas it aired all Six games during the first quarter last year. ESPN's ad revenue was down 7% in the quarter. The majority of the decline was due to the shift of the three bowl games out of Q1.

I hope you agree that last evening's announcement of the closing of our innovative ProMedica joint venture, our solid Q2 results and the increase in 2018 FFO guidance all validate that statement. It's no secret that the operating environment for senior's housing remains challenging. Nevertheless, the benefit of owning a premier major urban market-focused portfolio is that we still managed to deliver some growth over last year. Mercedes will give you some perspective on the current state of the senior housing industry and some insights into why Welltower's operating platform continues to outperform.

And clearly, you're financing at least, additionally short-term, then you're going to go out. So that would have been a positive offset to warehousing some of these dilutive assets that you're bringing oat the balance sheet. It just seems like a pretty wide spread, that number should be closer to, call it, maybe $4.10 for the balance -- for the year versus the $4.025 midpoint. And maybe you can just be a little bit more specific in terms of the building blocks or each of the pieces of what's going on. And then wrapped around in that, I mean, as guys moved your earnings a week earlier, I don't know if that is indicative of being -- going out and being arguably in the market, either debt or equity -- and/or equity.

Across our domestic business, we're delivering more production with less cost to generate growth and value towards our breakeven plan. As Vicki mentioned, we attribute this success to our differentiated value-based development approach. Our Permian Resources New Mexico team delivered record-breaking well results across multiple benches in the Greater Sand Dunes area as shown on Slide 14. During the quarter, our team put on a total of 7 wells in the Greater Sand Dunes area with 30-day production rates that averaged approximately 3,750 BOE per day. 3 of these wells ranked in the top 15 all-time best wells in the Permian basin based on 30-day BOE per day."

So as we think about that relationship, could you kind of help us a little bit, maybe frame it up with the 3.5% to 4% annual price increases x fuel. Is this the kind of year where you can get sort of the high end of that because of what's going on in the truckload market?

On August 31, we completed the previously announced disposal of Sellbytel. In addition, during the third quarter, we disposed of 18 other companies, which were primarily in our CRM execution and support discipline and to a lesser extent in our CRM consumer experience discipline. These businesses were no longer aligned with our long-term strategy. The disposition activity resulted in a net gain to our P&L in the quarter which Phil will cover during his remarks."

Many of the world's largest marketers and best known brands continue to undergo major changes driven by advances in technology, new disruptive competitors and changing consumer behavior. The breath and rate of change has CEOs and CMOs focused on the ability of their marketing organizations to keep pace and that is presenting opportunities and challenges for our agencies."

            "And then on Q4, you say it was the hardest quarter to guide to, because you had $200 million to $250 million of kind of project-based revenue. Could we get a feel of the last kind of 10 years, what has been the worst year and the best year of those project-base? Does it go as low as 100 million and as high as 400, so we can gauge the volatility of Q4? Thank you.",

Each year, we've found this year-end project work is between $200 million and $250 million. Client spending on these projects is not easy to forecast, and typically it is based on individual client circumstances and general economic conditions."

            "That was very helpful. Really do appreciate that. Maybe as a follow-up question, kind of a two parter, if you don't mind. With your CapEx activity, I mean, despite the fact that you've announced these new projects, it is definitely lower than where it's been and you sort of see slowing producer activity. I was just wondering what are the opportunities for ONEOK to pivot and optimize on the cost side? Are there costs that you can now strip out now that you can sort of see where your business is running? And also, are you able to potentially pursue an asset-light strategy? When I sort of think about your Elk Creek expansion as well as the West Texas LPG brings a lot more volumes into -- on the NGL side, which would suggest you would need a frac. But given their excess frac capacity out there, are there ways for you to sublease others -- other fracs and sort of take advantage of that in pursuing asset-light strategy? Just sort of wondering if you can sort of talk about other ways to optimize for further earnings growth beyond 2021?",

                  "2019 was an outstanding year, a year of project execution and record-setting safety performance for ONEOK, positioning ourselves for exceptional growth in 2020 and 2021. Yesterday, we announced fourth quarter and full year 2019 results, announced our 2020 guidance and provided a 2021 outlook. We also announced 3 expansion projects that will further strengthen ONEOK's position in the Williston and Permian Basins, and increase the needed natural gas processing and NGL transportation capacity for our customers. It is important to point out that these high-return projects build off of our existing assets. These projects include the Demicks Lake III plant in the Williston Basin, the full expansion of the Elk Creek pipeline to 400,000 barrels per day and the fourth expansion of the West Texas LPG pipeline since October 2017."

            "Okay great. And then just a follow-up, ethane recovery versus rejection has been a topic for some time. There's kind of an interesting developing market dynamic where you look at natural gas capacity being scarce in the Permian. And at times you've seen some sizeable differentials with Waha and, and Henry Hub, it could create a scenario where the economics of recovering ethane becomes greater in the Permian than any other basin in the country. And there's the possibility that Permian ethane recovery crowds out other basins. How is ONEOK positioned if this materializes? Is it offset by the full scale system that you have in place? Or is there some risk to the $100 million plus of ethane recovery that you're looking for this year.",

As outlined in our 2018 guidance, this additional demand for ethane is expected to drive approximately $100 million of additional EBITDA in our NGL segment compared with 2017. After staying for a few years now that new petrochemical facilities and ethane crackers are being built, it is now evident in the marketplace that the incremental demand for ethane is here. Our focus remains on executing our cracker growth projects to meet the need of our customers at Williston, Powder River, DJ STACKS SCOOPS and Permian basins."

I am just thinking back to the \u2013 before the commodity price collapse of 2015, you had plans for the Knox plant 200 a day again for 365 to 470 million. So, from a cost per capacity standpoint, this is clearly better. My question is why not choose to expand Canadian Valley in the first place over Knox a few years ago?

Overall, we have increased adjusted EBITDA for our natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas pipelines segments and increased our G&P volume outlook. These increases were primarily driven by higher than projected volumes in the Williston Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas and our expectation that drilling and completion activity will remain strong through the second half of the year based on recent discussions with our producer customers. We narrowed our adjusted EBITDA guidance in the natural gas liquids segment reflecting adjustments for the timing of the expected volume increases from recently connected third-party plants. In mid-June, we announced NGL and natural gas related expansion projects totaling approximately $170 million to accommodate growth in the STACK area. Projects include a 60,000 barrel per day expansion of our Sterling III NGL pipeline, increasing its capacity to 250,000 barrels per day and additional NGL gathering system expansions in the area, which are all backed by a long-term contract and plant dedications."

This quarter platform and infrastructure grew 1% constant currency and we realized there is headwinds in there from like the middleware business and probably some other things, but more interested in the database. As you say Larry that that's one of the strategic products as that has to be successful here. Can you give us some more color on the database in this quarter, especially for the options? And to that stand out for me or multi-tenancy and in memory, but I know there is other that are associated with the autonomous database. I mean these are two, but others that are really specifically.

I guess two questions, one, in the quarter, and guess as you look at your -- the remainder of the year, are there any different assumptions around price costs or your ability to get price in a market? Can you just talk about how that's going? And then my second question, sorry, back to North America Industrial; Tom, I appreciate the comments you had made about CLARCOR in closing or plants and stuff like that, and that will impact margins or incrementals over the next two quarters. But as we shift to fiscal year 2019, with most of that done, can we start to think about North America achieving more normalized incremental margins, or given where we'd be in the cycle, could you get above average incremental margins, versus your longer term target?

Operating margin for the second quarter on an adjusted basis was 15.1% of sales versus 16.6% in the prior year. Current year includes 160 basis points of CLARCOR related incremental depreciation and amortization expense. Without this, margins improved 110 basis points."

Under our previous revenue categories, there is no change to payroll revenue guidance in the range of 2% to 3% and HRS revenue guidance in the range of 10% to 11%. Payroll services revenue was below the low end of the range in the first quarter as anticipated due to the composition of payroll processing days. Growth in payroll revenue will be at or above the high end of the range for Q2 and Q3 and Q4 is anticipated to be within the range. HRS revenue growth for the first quarter was significantly higher than the range due to the timing of the HROI acquisition. Growth for Q2 and Q3 is anticipated to be within the range. For Q4, growth is anticipated to be below the low end of the range due to a more challenging compare caused by the strong growth in the PEO in the latter part of fiscal 2018."

We also introduced substantial enhancements to our learning management platform with performance evidence and video content creator. We are kicking off 2020 with what I believe will be one of the most significant product developments of the last two years.

The core loan portfolio excludes the runoff of select United loan portfolios, which ended 2019 with an aggregate balance of $1.346 billion. This balance is less than the approximately $1.8 billion in runoff we referenced at the acquisition\u2019s announcement, due to a subsequent decision to sell $492 million of these loans. As such, these balances are included in the loans held for sale line on the balance sheet. We expect the runoff of the select United portfolios to be in the range of $300 million to $400 million for the full year. Core loans also excludes the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio, which is in runoff mode. Period-end balances for this portfolio finished 2019 at $737 million.

Our customers, employees and partners feel good knowing that there is a shared journey of sustainable transformation making our products more nutritious and more resource efficient, dialing up the taste while reducing our environmental footprint. Our investors can feel good knowing this makes us a stronger business over the long-term, that we can also do well by also doing good. 12 years ago, we embarked on a journey of PepsiCo, as we call, Performance with Purpose. Since then, much has changed at PepsiCo and around the world, but the underlying principles behind Performance with Purpose remain. Much of our early work on Performance with Purpose requires us to think differently about our business and make the kinds of long-term investments from researching and developing new more nutritious products to finding ways to reduce water and energy use across plants and farms that will help us deliver on the vision of making our growth, our operations and our impact more sustainable. Sustainability has been defined as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

With the launch less than three months to get -- away, you've talked at the Analyst Day about having 90%-plus awareness. Can you just -- I haven't seen marketing yet, so can you talk about the plan? Different topic but on all of the stuff that's going on in China as well as in Hong Kong, can you talk a little bit about -- or give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of impact on -- towards some of the parks and how it might be affecting pricing and future investment? And then one last kind of follow-up on the pricing. You did increase prices unusually, I think just -- I'm not sure if it's just Disneyland. Can you talk about how you're thinking about pricing going forward at the domestic parks?",

                  "Before I conclude, I'd like to highlight a few additional items, such should help frame our fiscal 2020 first quarter and full-year results. First, we expect our Direct to Consumer & International segment to generate about $800 million in operating losses for the quarter. We expect the continued investment in our DTC services, specifically Disney+, which will launch in just a few days and the consolidation of Hulu to drive an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in segment operating income of our direct-to-consumer businesses of approximately $850 million."
