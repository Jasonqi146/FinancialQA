And now that you've had a chance to review the network and maybe adoption rates to increase connectivity, are you still thinking that the regional fleet will be flattish after the year-end 2017 levels?

So Scott, based on the disclosures that United provides around the economics of MileagePlus, it appears that the program is considerably less valuable than American. So American disclosed $1.9 billion marketing revenue in 2016, United disclosed $1.2 billion, American is expecting an incremental $800 million in EBIT by 2018 from the new credit card deal. You're expecting only 8 -- only $300 million. So structurally, is there a reason why United's business of selling miles to third parties is less valuable than American's? Or your disclosures understate the value you received?",

Also during the quarter, we purchased 12 737NGs off lease. These are not incremental aircraft to the fleet, but rather aircraft we've operated since new. We expect to enter into many similar transactions when we can cost-effectively purchase leased aircraft that we expect to operate for many years instead of acquiring new aircraft to replace equipment at the end of the lease term."

Do you anticipate shift from small group to individual either near-term or long-term and how are you positioned for that given your footprint pullback in the individual market? And the second would just be public charge rule.

When I look at drug costs being well under control, down maybe under 1%, hospital base flat, just millions of point solutions popping out for every healthcare spend category you can think of. I struggle to connect all those dots to help trend -- cost trends still being 6%, which is as you know 3x CPI. So, in your mind -- and then, you guys doing dozen things in local markets to push risk downstream and that sort of thing. So, what will it take to get the step function trend down say a couple of hundred basis points beyond all the good work that you've already done? I am just struggling why so persistently high. And the Kaiser survey and the political landscape is pointing to this being kind of a bigger and bigger problem, especially with the rise and high co-pay plans.

We saw a big ramp in the ground pricing and maybe you could talk a bit about the surcharges coming up for peak season. Is that kind of automatic for every customer? Are there still contract customers you have to go renegotiate with? Maybe you can just talk about that given the ramp up we're seeing on the pricing as we head into the back half of the year.",

I'm curious where you think the industry is in kind of in the context of the broader cycle. We've had several years of excess capacity in that globally on the Air Freight side. It seems as though it's tightened up. Load factors have improved. There are some anecdotes of some forwarders putting charter capacity into the market as well. So where do you think we are cyclically as it relates to industry Air Freight supply/demand? Has that helped International parcel yields at all and what are your second half peak expectations from an Air Freight point of view? Thanks.",

When you set up the framework for 2018 and it\u2019s framework, it\u2019s early, is next year a year where the framework is rate growth should be higher than your utilization growth?

And some of the commentary we've heard from, I guess, peers and reinsurers and so forth, it's suggested that maybe RBC isn't the best measure of capital adequacy as it relates to LTC specifically. And we see similar situations and things like variable annuities where it's not a great reflection. And sometimes companies run with materially higher RBC to reflect that because their internal capital models show greater risk relative to like what RBC would suggest.

I don't think that has anything to do with a couple of pennies. I think investors are adopting, your reserve adequacy and so far, my sense is that you are not exhibiting that same level of confidence with the quality of your reserves that you did last quarter.

So where I guess it's long winded way of asking like where is pricing now and where do you see that going, I assume it's no longer hardening and the question is would you consider trading better growth for giving up some margin going forward because it does look like you have some room here from an ROE standpoint?",

Obviously, there are some near-term volatility in those rates, but I think the market is expecting shipping rates both on the crude and product side to be structurally higher than they were in kind of the first half of this year. Can you just talk from a totality perspective for Valero, how those higher rates impact the Company\u2019s earnings?

But when we look at the forward curves of Brent and 3% credit spread on Bloomberg, we assumed about a $8.50 or $9 widening in the next six months. Now since HSFO makes up 40% of the Maya pricing formula, mathematically, it translates to about $3 to $4 widening of Brent Maya. So, could the Brent Maya easily be $10, just following the pricing formula as it exists today or do you think Pemex, et cetera, try and step in and try and change the formula and get rid of high sulfur fuel oil pricing from the formula?",

Downward trends and product inventories and structural shortages in the primary export markets for the U.S. Gulf Coast provide an encouraging backdrop as we move into the second half of the year. On the crude supply side, we're seeing the impact of the OPEC cuts on the medium and heavy sour discounts, but increased U.S. drilling activity and crude production have supported attractive domestic sweet crude discounts relative to Brent in the second quarter. As a result, we switched our refining system to a maximum light crude slate in June. With current market conditions, operating a system with flexibility to process a broad range of feedstocks is very beneficial."

                  "In our Oncology business, orders grew 16% in the quarter, our highest growth rate in a decade, and 11% in the trailing 12 months. Our worldwide net installed base is now 8,198 units, an increase of 322 units or 4%. This continued growth in our installed base drives recurring revenue from software and services. On the hardware side, we made progress with our global rollout of Halcyon, and have now taken 202 orders since our May 2017 launch, including 20 orders in the first quarter, up eight units or 67%. Since launch, over 60% of orders worldwide have been incremental. Additionally, Halcyon was selected by R&D magazine as an R&D 100 winner as one of the most exceptional innovations in science and technology in 2018. We are pleased that Halcyon was recognized for empowering clinicians to care for more patients by making radiation therapy simpler and more efficient than ever."

I was just kind of wondering, when you look at prior product cycles, TrueBeam for instance, I think that product cycle, maybe back 7 years or so, peaked at maybe 350, 375 orders for the year. I mean, based on this run rate, we would sort of be getting close to 300, north of 300 for the year. So how long of a runway do you think Halcyon is from a product cycle? And where do you think it could peak on in terms of adding more orders? And then I have a follow-up on guidance.",

Based on public filings, the radiation therapy market grew 8% on an orders basis over the trailing 12 months, ending in June 2018. We maintained our market leadership and worldwide share during that period. In our Oncology business, orders grew 13% in the quarter to a record $1.1 billion, the first time we have broken $1 billion in orders for a quarter. For the full year, we grew orders 9% to a record $3.1 billion. Similarly, this was the first time we exceeded $3 billion in annual orders. Adding to these impressive milestones, growth in both the fourth quarter and full year were driven by growth in every region. This success has been driven by investments in field infrastructure and industry-leading innovation. This past year, big competitive wins included MacCallum, Karolinska and now Genesis Care."

So I'm just wondering if that's accurate.

So first of all, just in the quarter the way to think about what was a robust revenue growth rate of 13%, is in our oncology business from a hardware perspective, we mix the hardware. And then inside of that we have really saw an acceleration of units that we kind of booked in orders over the last six months, is a higher percentage of our overall book than we had seen in the prior year, even all of last year. And so we attribute that to some good execution in the field, but also just kind of how the order book mixed out into revenue here early in the year. So, can we keep that up, that level of consistency, it\u2019s choppy, it\u2019s choppy out there, that\u2019s part of while we went to annual guidance we are trying to smooth out some of that choppiness that we see in any given quarter. So overall we are happy with execution. We like the book of business that we took on from an orders perspective, it\u2019s 7% in oncology. We think that translates into 4% to 7% kind of revenue growth over the year. As it relates to backlog, that the backlog for oncology is something that it wasn\u2019t impacted by ASC 606 first and foremost, okay, so there is no impact from ASC 606 adoption the backlog at all. We made a change in methodology right that we had talked about on the call and there were no abnormal amounts of dormancy that we saw in the quarter from what we would see normally with regard to a percent of the overall backlog total. So, we are not seeing anything at all to reiterate from ASC 606 in backlog and the overall oncology business backlog increased 10%, sorry, the overall the Varian backlog increased 10% year-on-year and oncology grew 7% year-on-year to $2.7 billion of backlog. So, good backlog growth should translate into that 4% to 7% revenue growth hasn\u2019t moved through the year.",

In May, we introduced the Halcyon treatment platform, which is designed to extend the availability of high-quality cancer care globally. Since the introduction, we have received 50 orders across 15 countries. Installations are progressing well and the first patient was treated at the University of Pennsylvania on September 13. In August, HyperArc treated its first patients in Negrar, Italy after receiving the CE Mark that same month. FDA clearance followed in September. We finished the year with six new proton therapy orders, bringing the total number of proton customers to 21."

The fiscal fourth quarter guide is a little bit off from where we were expecting. And maybe, Dow, you can walk us through if there's any selling day impacts in there and what the read is for Oncology versus proton specifically in fourth quarter. And then, in terms of Halcyon, are you disclosing the specific order number in the quarters overall? And then maybe how is the funnel shaping up as you look out into the second half of the calendar year?",

I think that's how it flowed through last time with \u2013 I'm blanking on the other deal with the one in Baltimore. I just want to make sure I'm not double counting, because your tax rate came in a couple hundred basis points lower than we were expecting.

                  "First, looking at senior living trends nationally, we are very encouraged by the recently reported continued improvement in Senior Living starts, which have reached their most favorable points since the third quarter of 2012. As starts continued to moderate, demand for our product ramped to it's highest level ever in 2018. The 75-year to 81-year old contingent is growing 4% per year for the next five years, and the 82-year to 86-year old cohort begins to grow over 3% per year after 2019. Assuming these trends continue, we anticipate a bottoming in senior housing so that the supply-demand equation moves in our favor in the future creating a powerful cyclical upside. Potential increases in the penetration rate would incrementally improve this picture."

And you talked in your comments about how you are pleasantly surprised by the reduction in the growth rate, but at the same time you talked about and you see both Related and Atria launching $3 billion at the high end senior housing. I guess what gives you confidence that the supply is not going to stop anytime soon especially with that demographic range that will come out in the future?",

To my mind, sustainability starts with financial strength and resilient cash flows from a high quality diverse portfolio. At Ventas, we are focused on both. This quarter, we continued our proactive and successful efforts to build financial strength and reduce risk through debt refinancing and maturity expansions, and our portfolio produce growing same-store cash NOI per of 1.3% as a result of its quality and diversification and product type in operating model."

You have the investments that you're making which will start to earn income. There is a still lot of pieces to 2019 that we need to be taking into consideration.",

                  "Looking at macro senior housing trends, we are very encouraged with the recently reported continued improvement in senior living starts, which are at a five-year low. Importantly, in primary markets, net absorption in assisted living in the third quarter of 2018 was the strongest third quarter for net demand on record. However, it has been widely documented, we expect to experience another year of elevated deliveries in 2019, as the industry works its way through the opening of new communities that were started in anticipation of the demographic demand that will accelerate in the coming years. If current trends continue, the current supply demand equation will surely reverse in our favor and that's why our senior housing assets continue to be so highly valued."

Because we were looking back and we saw fees, you talked about some Kindred coming in.

I think at NARIET there was that expectation that things were \"feeling better\" but then we get the next 2Q data, we get result and the NIC data also kind of pointing to the fact that the site improved absorption that was through expecting decline in occupancy over the next 12 months. So kind of against that backdrop how do you think your portfolio ends up performing, how do you think about need to do additional restructuring et cetera, et cetera?",

So, I think if I\u2019m reading this right, you start off with at $8 million of rent concession this year and it trickles down into $5 million in 2025, and there is a profits that\u2019s get you there. So, from adding it up right its $48 million of rent cuts collectively over eight years. So, if the question -- is it appropriate to say that well you maybe aren\u2019t resolving the coverage issue all it once, but you\u2019re doing a gradually overtime and then once the as you call the silver wave hits in 2025, hopefully, you have achieved the goal of appropriate coverage or even better coverage by that time.

So, there is an objective, there are objective standards for a change in control hence the change of the control occurs than rents we\u2019ll received additional protection and enhancements including lease expansions out to 29 as well as commitments to CapEx and fees. In order to do that, we have provided basically three general objectives standards. One is financial result that fire. One is reputational.
