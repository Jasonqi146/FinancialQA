We also have others in the room available to assist with Q&A.',\n"," 'And now I would like to turn the call over to Oscar.',\n"," 'Oscar Munoz',\n"," 'Thank you, Julie. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before we '\n"," \"review United's performance for the previous quarter, I want to address the \"\n"," 'events on last week. The incident on Flight 3411 has been a humbling, '\n"," 'learning experience for all of us here at United and for me, in particular.',\n"," 'In addition to apologizing to Dr. Dao as well as all the passengers aboard, '\n"," 'I also want to apologize to our customers. You can and should expect more '\n"," 'from us and as CEO, I take full responsibility for making this right.',\n"," \"We've always sought to repay our customers' trust with the highest quality \"\n"," 'of service and deepest level of respect and dignity. We are and will make '\n"," 'the necessary policy changes to ensure this never happens again.',\n"," 'Those changes began with two key announcements last week. First, from now '\n"," \"on, we'll not call for law enforcement to remove passengers from our flight, \"\n"," 'except in cases of security or safety concerns. Second, crews traveling on '\n"," 'our aircraft must be booked at least 60 minutes prior to departure.',\n"," 'In addition, we continue to review a broader array of policies and systems '\n"," 'that factor into situations like this. And importantly, we are involving our '\n"," 'front-line employees and, to a degree, some of our customers to help us take '\n"," \"a more common-sense approach to how we do things. We'll communicate the \"\n"," 'results of our review and the additional actions we will take by April 30th.',\n"," 'Now if I could, turning to the topic of earnings and operational '\n"," 'performance. As the positive financial results we will discuss today make '\n"," 'clear, our people have done a great work to create a more reliable, '\n"," 'profitable, and financially sound airline for our customers, investors and '\n"," 'everyone we serve.',\n"," 'Our financial and operational performance in the first quarter of 2017 gives '\n"," \"us a lot of confidence about the foundation we're building, but it's clear \"\n"," 'we have further to go in terms of elevating the experience our customers '\n"," 'have with us. This is a true learning opportunity and will ultimately prove '\n"," 'to be a watershed moment for our company as we work harder than ever to put '\n"," 'our customers at the center of everything we do.',\n"," \"Now, I'll turn it over to Scott to give an update on operations and revenue.\",\n"," 'Scott Kirby',\n"," 'Thank you, Oscar, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I echo '\n"," \"Oscar's thoughts on last week's incident. Our entire leadership team and the \"\n"," 'entire airline is focused on learning from this terrible event and making '\n"," 'United truly customer-focused in everything that we do.',\n"," 'While we had a big failure last week, our 2017 operational and financial '\n"," \"performance is off to a strong start. Building on a record 2016, we're \"\n"," 'already setting new operational records in 2017 and our performance improved '\n"," 'as the quarter progressed. Demand is solid and we performed in line with our '\n"," 'unit revenue forecast during the quarter despite better completion factor, '\n"," 'which led to higher capacity.',\n"," 'The positive momentum and the revenue environment that we saw late last year '\n"," 'continued into the first quarter and our outlook for the second quarter unit '\n"," 'revenue growth is stronger today on higher capacity growth than it was just '\n"," 'a few months ago.',\n"," 'We expect to return to positive system unit revenue growth in the second '\n"," 'quarter, which will mark positive year-over-year growth in this key metric '\n"," 'for the first time since early 2015, assuming the quarter plays out as we '\n"," 'expect.',\n"," 'On slide five, we show operational improvements in the quarter. We remain '\n"," 'focused on continually improving our operational reliability. Our completion '\n"," 'factor performance in the quarter improved from last year, helped by 25 days '\n"," 'of 100% mainline completion, which surpassed our annual record set just last '\n"," 'year and is more perfect days than all of 2011 through 2015 combined.',\n"," 'Our mishandled baggage performance continues to improve. We achieved our '\n"," 'best-ever consolidated on-time departure rate for February and any March, '\n"," 'and year-to-date; each of our major competitors had canceled more than twice '\n"," 'as many flights as has United.',\n"," 'Slide six illustrates how changes to our yield management posture are also '\n"," 'allowing us to drive better revenue results. As you can see for the past two '\n"," 'years, United had a philosophy of never letting advance booked load factor '\n"," 'get behind.',\n"," 'For the past two years, our bookings 60 days in advance were never '\n"," '[indiscernible] 2% behind. And if your goal is to keep bookings high, the '\n"," \"easiest way to do that is to lower the prices, and that's exactly what \"\n"," 'United was doing.',\n"," \"In fact, if you look at slide seven in our deck, we're just industry PRASM \"\n"," 'in general due to the step function change in the fourth quarter, and I '\n"," 'think this was primarily driven by United reducing its reliance on '\n"," 'advance-purchase discounts.',\n"," 'The second problem with this strategy was that we sold out too soon and '\n"," 'spilled our natural market share of close-in business demand to our '\n"," 'competitors. As you can see back on slide six, we changed that posture and '\n"," 'are now willing to take much more risk that high-yield business customers '\n"," 'are going to choose United if we just keep seats available for them.',\n"," \"And it's working. In the first quarter, our close-in bookings were up around \"\n"," '12% year-over-year and our corporate revenue was up 11% year-over-year '\n"," 'compared with an average of down 1% for the last three quarters. The Easter '\n"," 'shift and the extra Friday in March did help, but we also think this is '\n"," 'evident that United is restoring its natural market share.',\n"," 'Despite starting well behind, you could see that we closed the load factor '\n"," 'gap in both the fourth and first quarters and we expect and hope to do so '\n"," 'again in the second quarter. This change leads to a better overall pricing '\n"," 'environment and better mix and allows United to simply restore our natural '\n"," 'close-in to business demand market share.',\n"," 'While all of our competitors are lowering their unit revenue outlook from '\n"," 'the first quarter, our forecast started just below our guided midpoint and '\n"," 'improved to flat despite a one point higher completion factor. This '\n"," \"phenomenon at our competitors wasn't about demand weakness.\",\n"," \"It was about United customers coming back to United, and we simply couldn't \"\n"," \"accommodate them in years past because we weren't leaving seats for the last \"\n"," 'minute bookings customers.',\n"," 'In the past, we forced many of our best customers to fly with our '\n"," 'competitors because we were sold out and our changes now mean that they can '\n"," 'and are returning to United Airlines. While the whole industry is seeing '\n"," 'strong close-in demand, United is better positioned to capitalize on it with '\n"," 'more seats to sell close-in on a year-over-year basis.',\n"," \"We expect the second quarter to be United's best PRASM performance in two \"\n"," 'years. Our consolidated PRASM was flat for the first quarter, right at the '\n"," 'midpoint of our guidance provided in January despite running one point '\n"," 'higher in completion factor.',\n"," 'We saw strong close-in demand in March, and throughout the quarter, we saw '\n"," 'improvement across the system, with Houston, Washington Dulles and Chicago '\n"," 'all showing positive year-over-year improvement.',\n"," 'Internationally, both the Atlantic and Pacific performance was better than '\n"," 'forecasted. The strength in the Atlantic was boosted by strong results in '\n"," 'Germany and a U.S. point-of-sale shift, while the Pacific was helped by '\n"," 'positive PRASM in Japan.',\n"," 'We anticipate second quarter consolidated PRASM to be up 1% to 2% -- 1% to '\n"," '3%, 200 basis points better than at the midpoint from the first quarter. If '\n"," 'the quarter plays out like we think, this will mark the fifth straight '\n"," 'quarter of sequential improvement and the first quarter of positive unit '\n"," 'revenue growth in two years.',\n"," 'Moving to slide eight for an overview by region. During the second quarter, '\n"," 'we expect sequential improvement in all geographies, except the Atlantic, '\n"," 'which we expect will be approximately flat after surprising with positive '\n"," 'growth in the first quarter. The Easter shift had a much more pronounced '\n"," 'positive impact on yield in the Atlantic during March than we anticipated '\n"," \"and we're now expecting an opposite impact in April.\",\n"," \"We're currently forecasting solid positive unit revenue growth in domestic \"\n"," 'and Latin markets. Latin remains a bright spot, and we look for the '\n"," 'year-over-year increase to be in the mid-single-digits in the second '\n"," 'quarter, driven by strength in Brazil and Argentina and a tailwind from the '\n"," 'Easter shift. In the Pacific, declines are expected to moderate again in the '\n"," 'second quarter.',\n"," 'Our capacity outlook for the second quarter is up 3% to 4%. We expect that '\n"," 'growth to be biased towards higher domestic growth with an increase of 4.5% '\n"," 'to 5.5%. Our domestic year-over-year growth will peak in June and July, '\n"," 'driven by improved utilization of our fleet this summer.',\n"," 'Our full year outlook for system capacity growth remains up 2.5% to 3.5% and '\n"," 'is consistent with our updated guidance from March 15. Our capacity growth '\n"," 'is comprised of nearly a 5% increase in gauge, partially offset by fewer '\n"," \"departures. We're delivering on our promises from Investor Day, which \"\n"," 'included restoring the domestic network to its natural share in our hubs.',\n"," 'Everyone knows that United never should have been flying regional jets in '\n"," \"markets like Chicago to Washington National or Newark to Atlanta. We're \"\n"," 'up-gauging where we should be flying larger planes, and that, by the way, is '\n"," 'mostly in places where we historically did fly larger planes.',\n"," \"And we're putting smaller planes in markets that will drive better \"\n"," 'connectivity to our hubs, places like Champaign, Illinois and Rochester, '\n"," 'Minnesota. These [indiscernible] markets have better pricing structure than '\n"," \"large markets and help to improve connectivity in our hubs. We'll continue \"\n"," 'to improve connectivity, and we will start re-banking later this fall, which '\n"," 'will be the next step in our network optimization.',\n"," \"We're even more excited about our opportunities today than we were at \"\n"," 'Investor Day five months ago, and we look forward to providing proof points '\n"," \"that we're executing over the coming quarters and years.\",\n"," \"To close, I want to, again, say that we're committed to learning from last \"\n"," \"week's failure by becoming the most customer-centric airline we can be in \"\n"," 'everything that we do.',\n"," \"Now, I'll turn it over to Andrew to review the financial results.\",\n"," 'Andrew Levy',\n"," 'Thanks Scott. Before I turn to the numbers, I want to make it clear I share '\n"," 'the sentiments expressed by Oscar and Scott about what occurred last week. '\n"," 'Our entire team is working together to identify ways we can become a more '\n"," 'customer-focused airline and are confident we will succeed in this goal.',\n"," 'Yesterday afternoon, we released our first quarter 2017 earnings as well as '\n"," 'our second quarter investor update. I will discuss both our results and '\n"," 'outlook at a high level, but please refer to those documents for additional '\n"," 'detail.',\n"," 'Slide 10 is a summary of our GAAP financials and slide 11 shows our non-GAAP '\n"," 'results. In the first quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of '\n"," '$0.41. We generated pretax income of $196 million, which represented a 2.3% '\n"," 'pretax margin excluding special items. First quarter 2017 results were lower '\n"," 'year-over-year mostly due to higher fuel expense and labor rate increases.',\n"," 'Turning to slide 12, our first quarter non-fuel unit costs, excluding '\n"," 'special items, profit-sharing and third-party expenses, increased 5% as '\n"," 'compared with the first quarter 2016. 4.2 percentage points of this increase '\n"," 'was due to new labor rates from the 2016 agreements.',\n"," 'For the second quarter, we expect non-fuel unit costs, excluding special '\n"," 'items, profit-sharing and third-party expenses, to increase between 4% and '\n"," '5%, with approximately four percentage points of this increase due to the '\n"," 'higher labor rates.',\n"," 'Last month, we reduced our guidance for full year 2017 non-fuel unit costs '\n"," 'to an increase of between 2.5% and 3.5%. We are affirming this guidance '\n"," 'today despite elevated unit cost growth in the first quarter and our '\n"," 'forecasted increase in the second quarter of 4.5% at the midpoint of the '\n"," 'guided range. We expect the increase in nonfuel unit costs to slow '\n"," 'appreciably during the last two quarters of the year.',\n"," 'Turning to slide 13, we ended the first quarter with $6.4 billion of '\n"," 'unrestricted liquidity, including our recently increased $2 billion '\n"," 'revolver, which is comfortably in excess of our stated minimum liquidity '\n"," 'target range. As of the end of the first quarter, our gross debt balance, '\n"," 'including capitalized operating leases was $17.6 billion.',\n"," 'During the quarter, we completed several financing transactions that '\n"," 'improved our liquidity by $1.35 billion. This included raising $300 million '\n"," 'of unsecured debt at a rate of 5%, increasing our term loan by $440 million '\n"," 'to $1.5 billion with more favorable terms and rate, and also upsizing our '\n"," 'revolver by $650 million to the $2 billion number I gave you a minute ago.',\n"," 'In the quarter, we spent $313 million repurchasing shares at an average '\n"," 'price of about $68 a share. We remain committed to returning excess cash to '\n"," 'our shareholders and will continue to be opportunistic to take advantage of '\n"," 'pullbacks in the stock. We currently have approximately $1.5 billion '\n"," 'remaining of repurchase authority.',\n"," 'Our 2017 guidance for CapEx remains between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion. '\n"," 'This is higher than 2016 due primarily to the delivery of 15 wide-body '\n"," 'aircraft. Also during the quarter, we purchased 12 737NGs off lease. These '\n"," \"are not incremental aircraft to the fleet, but rather aircraft we've \"\n"," 'operated since new. We expect to enter into many similar transactions when '\n"," 'we can cost-effectively purchase leased aircraft that we expect to operate '\n"," 'for many years instead of acquiring new aircraft to replace equipment at the '\n"," 'end of the lease term.',\n"," 'Additionally, we expect to grow the fleet by adding used aircraft. Growing '\n"," 'with used aircraft is much less capital-intensive, provides us with greater '\n"," 'balance sheet flexibility and therefore, de-risks our business at the '\n"," 'margin.',\n"," 'Lastly, regarding our fleet, we continue our comprehensive review of the '\n"," 'fleet and order book. We continue our work and we will update you when we '\n"," 'have new information to share.',\n"," 'On slide 14, we show summary of our guidance, including second quarter '\n"," 'projected fuel price range, which is using the April 12 curve. The ranges '\n"," 'for capacity, revenue and costs imply a second quarter pretax margin between '\n"," '10% and 12%.',\n"," \"In conclusion, we're off to a solid start in 2017 and remain focused on \"\n"," 'maintaining a strong balance sheet and finding incremental cost-savings '\n"," 'opportunities.',\n"," \"With that, I'd like to thank you all for joining the call today, and I'll \"\n"," 'now turn it back to Julie to open it up for Q&A.',\n"," 'Julie Yates Stewart',\n"," 'Thank you, Andrew.
