But we have strong partnerships across the Atlantic and '\n","  'Pacific. Adding Avianca, Copa and Azul to those relationships is going to '\n","  'give us the ability to give the American and LatAm a run for their money in '\n","  'Latin America.'],\n"," [\"So Scott, would you say that that's the region where you have the biggest \"\n","  'opportunity for improvement is in the Latin America region?',\n","  \"Well, we have opportunity for improvement everywhere, but it's the least \"\n","  \"developed region for us. So yes, it's the area with the most opportunity \"\n","  'for improvement.'],\n"," ['Yes, hey thanks. Two questions here. Hey, Scott, I just want to go back to '\n","  '-- you mentioned Houston, Dulles and Chicago seeing PRASM improvement. Just '\n","  \"specifically looking at Newark, if it weren't for the fact that \"\n","  'Newark-Florida fares were somewhat depressed, if we were to exclude that, '\n","  \"would have Newark's PRASM been up?\",\n","  'Newark what fares?'],\n"," ['If you were to exclude -- to Florida.',\n","  \"Excluding Florida. I mean, Newark was down 1%, and so I don't know. And \"\n","  \"actually, what's happened in Newark is there was a flood of low-cost \"\n","  'carrier capacity, and for a long time, United Airlines did not match the '\n","  'prices. We started matching the prices and I think our revenues, while down '\n","  'in those markets, is down less than it was before. So, we feel really good '\n","  'about that strategy.\\n'\n","  'At least our incremental change in strategy and competing more aggressively '\n","  'with the low-cost carriers in Newark, I think, is revenue positive. To be '\n","  'clear, with all the capacity in Florida, PRASM is certainly down, but it '\n","  'was down even more before we decided to start competing aggressively.'],\n"," ['Well. And then just my second question, Andrew, you talked about growing '\n","  \"the fleet with used aircraft. And I guess up until this point, you've -- \"\n","  \"predominantly, it's -- well, I shouldn't say predominantly, it's all been \"\n","  \"narrow-body. And I'm curious about your thoughts about used wide-bodies. I \"\n","  'think the view out in the marketplace is that reconfiguration costs are too '\n","  \"high. Hence, we don't see airlines really look at used wide-bodies. I mean, \"\n","  'what are your thoughts on that? Are there opportunities there for you, if '\n","  'you can elaborate?',\n","  'Yes. Hey, Mike.'],\n"," ['Hey.',\n","  \"The wide-body market is severely depressed across the board. There's \"\n","  \"tremendous opportunities in the used market. There's a lot of really good \"\n","  'high-quality aircraft available at very, very attractive low rates. So '\n","  \"you're right that the reconfiguration costs are certainly more significant, \"\n","  \"and it's, perhaps, a little bit tougher to make the economics work in a \"\n","  'normal situation.\\n'\n","  \"Certainly, with the -- today, I think we're in a different period in the \"\n","  'market, and so we are actively looking at wide-bodies and narrow-bodies and '\n","  \"we'll see. I think obviously, the weakness in demand for that sector has \"\n","  \"been well documented. It's nothing new. And I know the OEMs are feeling it \"\n","  \"as well. So, we'll see if we can take advantage of the dislocations that we \"\n","  'believe is there and will continue to be there for quite some time.'],\n"," ['Great. Thanks Andrew.', 'Thanks.'],\n"," ['Hey good morning. Scott, at the Analyst Day in November, you said that '\n","  'historically, inflections in RASM usually involve a couple months of '\n","  \"nail-biting, where you're behind on advance bookings, which is exactly \"\n","  \"what's happening, obviously, in slide six. So we're obviously more than a \"\n","  'couple months into it at this point.\\n'\n","  'So I guess the question is, are you deep enough into this point where you '\n","  \"can say that you're seeing that big turn, which is what you described it as \"\n","  'in November, in the revenue environment? Or do you need a couple more '\n","  'months to go before you can safely say that we have had that big turn, '\n","  'which are your words that you said in November?',\n","  \"Well, Hunter, you've followed me long enough to know that I'm an optimist \"\n","  \"by nature, so take what I'm going to say with a grain of salt. But yes, I \"\n","  'think we had a great turn in revenue in the fourth quarter. If you can just '\n","  'look at that graph, I think it was slide, what, six or seven for us and you '\n","  'can see going from RASM that is down 7.4%, down 6.6%, down 5.8%, all of a '\n","  \"sudden to down 1.6%. That's a big step function change and there really \"\n","  \"wasn't a big change in industry capacity at that point, not a flat, not up \"\n","  'to -- something changed in the fourth quarter.\\n'\n","  \"And my hypothesis is that what changed in the fourth quarter was United's \"\n","  'revenue management philosophy, which leads to a pricing philosophy change '\n","  'and that has changed and we expect things to continue to grow.\\n'\n","  \"What's not even in these numbers which will bear in the second half of the \"\n","  'year is Basic Economy, which we think is going to be really big, '\n","  'predictably by the time we get it at steady state. But I think there was '\n","  'inflection point in the fourth quarter and I feel pretty good that that has '\n","  'happened.'],\n"," ['Okay. And this is actually sort of a related question. You mentioned Basic '\n","  'Economy. I want to get back to a question asked a few months ago about '\n","  \"distribution as well. In an ideal world, if you're able to get the \"\n","  'distribution paradigm sort of adjusted to exactly how you want it to be.\\n'\n","  'Is there more of an opportunity to drive incremental revenues at the '\n","  'really, really low end like through things like Basic Economy or at the '\n","  \"really, really high end by turning airlines into -- dynamically, you're \"\n","  'competing on things like product and schedule, with price way at the bottom '\n","  'of the list. So, the question is, low-end or high-end opportunity as it '\n","  'relates to the distribution changes that you expect over the next couple of '\n","  'years.',\n","  \"Well, I think that there's opportunity on both. At United, and I said this \"\n","  'at my previous airline, roughly half of our revenue is coming from '\n","  'infrequent customers and half is coming from premium customers, customers '\n","  'that fly as often.\\n'\n","  \"And it's a little over simplistic to say that, that half of revenue coming \"\n","  'from infrequent customers just cares about price because a lot them care '\n","  \"about more than that. It's also -- the flip side is true that some of our \"\n","  'frequent customers are really shopping on price as well. But at a high '\n","  'level, you can think of it simplistically as half and half and we need to '\n","  'fuel both.\\n'\n","  \"And that's the wonderful thing about Basic Economy. It is giving our \"\n","  'customers choice. So, for those customers who do care about price -- and by '\n","  'the way, at launch this morning, we had a couple of flights go out and '\n","  \"smooth and we're encouraged with the initial launch from Minneapolis \"\n","  'today.\\n'\n","  \"But for our customers who want a lower price, it's fantastic that we can \"\n","  'give them that. And for customers who want a higher level of service and '\n","  'who are willing to pay for a higher level of service and a better product, '\n","  'we can give them that as well.\\n'\n","  \"This is all about giving our customers' choice, and I think it will happen \"\n","  'on both ends. It will make our product more attractive to customers. We are '\n","  'focused on getting the absolute lowest rock-bottom price, and it will also '\n","  'attract customers who would like to have a better level of service and a '\n","  'better product and are willing to pay for that.'],\n"," [\"Good morning. Just on the regional space, Scott, it sounds like you're \"\n","  'putting these aircraft in kind of mission-appropriate markets. And now that '\n","  \"you've had a chance to review the network and maybe adoption rates to \"\n","  'increase connectivity, are you still thinking that the regional fleet will '\n","  'be flattish after the year-end 2017 levels? And on that -- the Air '\n","  'Wisconsin deal, I was wondering how big that deal is and if that puts cost '\n","  \"pressure or if it's cost neutral.\",\n","  'So conceptually, if there were no constraints, meaning particularly no '\n","  'pilot constraints, we would probably be growing the regional fleet and '\n","  \"adding more of those regional markets. To be clear, we wouldn't be flying \"\n","  'them in places like Dulles to Chicago or Newark to Atlanta. We will be '\n","  \"flying them in places like Rochester, Minnesota, where they're more \"\n","  'appropriate.\\n'\n","  'So our regional fleet is less about -- our regional lift is going to be '\n","  'less about our optimal network strategy and much more about our regional '\n","  \"partners' ability to source aircraft and pilots, in particular.\\n\"\n","  'We -- as a general rule, most of those deals are trading down over time, '\n","  \"and we are losing aircraft. That's one of the great things about the Air \"\n","  'Wisconsin deal is we were able to go get aircraft that are going to come in '\n","  \"at a price that's kind of right in the middle of our prices on other deals, \"\n","  \"so it's attractive economics and to a large degree, will offset some of the \"\n","  'shrinking that we expect to occur at our other regional partners.\\n'\n","  \"And we're hoping that our other regional partners can actually keep flying \"\n","  'some of those aircraft longer. In fact, SkyWest, [Indiscernible], our '\n","  'numbers have gone up for aircraft at the end of the year because it turns '\n","  \"out they're going to be able to fly some of those aircraft a little longer \"\n","  \"than we thought. But at the end of the day, it's going to be driven -- our \"\n","  'regional count -- aircraft count is going to be driven much more by the '\n","  'pilot availability than it is by our optimal fleet plan.'],\n"," ['Got it. Thank you. And Andrew if I might ask a quick question. You might '\n","  \"have mentioned this in the opening remarks, but now that you've upped the \"\n","  'credit facility, is the cash target, is that unchanged? Or are you changing '\n","  'that as well?',\n","  \"Our cash target remains between $5 billion and $6 billion. That's a range \"\n","  \"we're comfortable with. And as you can tell, we're well above that at the \"\n","  \"current time. So, no, we don't expect to change that target range at all.\"],\n"," ['Hi, thanks for the time. Scott, when you were at American, you embarked on '\n","  'a hub rebanking effort, which I think, in general, leads to a slightly '\n","  'higher-cost operation exchanged -- in exchange for higher revenue. And I '\n","  'wondered if you could use some of the lessons that you learned there to '\n","  'tell us what you think the CASM hit might be over the next couple of years '\n","  'as you try to re-bank the United network.',\n","  'Look, it does cost more to run a banked operation than otherwise. I think '\n","  \"it's pretty small. It was a rounding error at American. It worked really \"\n","  'well. It will work really well here. I would point at American to Dulles, '\n","  'which had all the craziness going on with the Wright Amendment and the '\n","  'growth of Spirit, all that just huge headwinds, and yet Dulles was '\n","  'outperforming consistently on PRASM quarter after quarter because of the '\n","  \"higher levels of connectivity. So, I'm not sure what the CASM number will \"\n","  \"be, but I'm highly confident that the increase in revenue will more than \"\n","  'offset the PRASM hit.'],\n"," [\"Andrew, can you give some more color on what's in the other expense \"\n","  'category these days? If we look at that as a total -- as a percentage of '\n","  \"total operating expense or as a percentage of revenue, there's clearly some \"\n","  \"growth going on. It's a line item that now has overtaken consolidated fuel \"\n","  \"expense, for example. What's in there? And what's driving the growth?\",\n","  \"Well, there's a lot of items in there, as you noted, Jamie. What we're \"\n","  \"seeing that's driving the growth in this particular quarter is IT, \"\n","  'contracted labor, legal, timing of legal [Indiscernible], which is part of '\n","  'the increase year-over-year; maintenance services, which should be a '\n","  'variety of things, including software support. And also, food is in that '\n","  \"line item, and that's also elevated significantly year-over-year, partly \"\n","  'driven by the Polaris service launch that occurred at fourth quarter -- '\n","  'late fourth quarter of last year.'],\n"," [\"Okay, that's helpful. And second question for Scott. As we think about your \"\n","  'normal market share in your hubs, and I recognize every hub is going to be '\n","  'different, but how does the -- I mean, does your 2020 margin goals '\n","  \"specifically require a level of pricing power that's unattainable unless \"\n","  \"you increase share by, I don't know, more than 5%, 10%? I mean, basically, \"\n","  'can you achieve your margin goal with domestic hub share below 50%, with '\n","  'the exception of Houston?',\n","  \"Well, look, I don't think of it as market share driving pricing power. I \"\n","  'think of it more as 2 things: one, driving higher levels of connectivity. '\n","  \"When we don't have these higher levels, we have lower levels of \"\n","  \"connectivity that's high yield [Technical Difficulty] that's completely \"\n","  'missing from the network and just giving to your competitors.\\n'\n","  \"And second, places like -- let's just take Newark because I talk about it a \"\n","  'lot. We have a Newark-based global services or 1K customer, and we started '\n","  'flying the regional jet to Atlanta and regional jets to Dulles and regional '\n","  'jets to Detroit. We pushed that global services customer, who is a '\n","  'high-yield customer, who booked at the last minute to fly on Delta and '\n","  'American in those markets.\\n'\n","  'And beyond that, that customer used to just be a Newark-based customer that '\n","  \"was on American -- or United Airlines' frequent flyer program and flew \"\n","  'exclusively on United. But now, all of a sudden, anywhere they flew, they '\n","  'decided to go shop because we forced them to carry free frequent flyer '\n","  \"cards in their wallet, and because of that, they're no longer global \"\n","  \"services because they didn't fly on United all the time. We lost those \"\n","  'customers.\\n'\n","  \"So it's not about pricing power. It's about winning back the loyalty and \"\n","  'giving a better product to our best customers so that they choose and want '\n","  'to fly United Airlines. And so -- go ahead.'],\n"," ['No, go ahead, sorry. Sorry.',\n","  'I was just going to say restoring is not about gaining pricing power or '\n","  \"anything like that. It's about creating the best product for our customers \"\n","  \"in those markets so that they'd want to choose to fly United exclusively.\"],\n"," [\"All right. So, it's more about the quality of the ASMs that you add in your \"\n","  'hub than just attaining a share number, in other words.',\n","  'Absolutely.'],\n"," ['Okay. Because I think that point is lost in a lot of investors, so I '\n","  \"appreciate you clarifying it. I'm sorry. Did I cut you off, Oscar?\",\n","  'No. I just wanted to -- I will go back a little bit to your question to '\n","  \"Andrew with regards to the other expense category. I think it's important \"\n","  'to note that Andrew specifically is leading an initiative to bring down '\n","  'cost in the company across the board, and we had some success in that, and '\n","  \"that's what we'd committed.\\n\"\n","  'Additionally, with some of the components that we mentioned, I think we '\n","  \"have to recognize that they're investments for the customer, right, what do \"\n","  'you think of Polaris, what you think of the IT organization. Some of the '\n","  'tools that we rolled out already this year have had a significant level of '\n","  'improvement how we treat our customers.\\n'\n","  \"So, we'll continue to manage that and talk a little bit more of that \"\n","  'specifically because you will see that cost trend potentially continue. But '\n","  \"again, there's initiatives to offset it, plus it's getting a return with \"\n","  'regards to our revenue and passenger loads.'],\n"," [\"Just two questions on the loyalty program, which hasn't gotten a lot of \"\n","  'love today. So Scott, based on the disclosures that United provides around '\n","  'the economics of MileagePlus, it appears that the program is considerably '\n","  'less valuable than American. So American disclosed $1.9 billion marketing '\n","  'revenue in 2016, United disclosed $1.2 billion, American is expecting an '\n","  'incremental $800 million in EBIT by 2018 from the new credit card deal. '\n","  \"You're expecting only 8 -- only $300 million. So structurally, is there a \"\n","  \"reason why United's business of selling miles to third parties is less \"\n","  \"valuable than American's? Or your disclosures understate the value you \"\n","  'received?',\n","  'I do think that we have different disclosure policies, and this is '\n","  'something we are going to work on. Andrew Levy is nodding his head at me. '\n","  \"It's a big initiative for Andrew to figure out how we disclose this better. \"\n","  \"It's something that we are going to do -- or at least intent to. I think \"\n","  'your simplistic analysis -- it would be hard for you to know because we put '\n","  \"it in other lines, but isn't right.\\n\"\n","  \"One thing it is right is that at the moment, Americas' growth rate is much \"\n","  \"higher. Delta's growth rate also is much higher from today's date. That's \"\n","  'the bad news. The good news is, I believe that our partner -- partners at '\n","  'JPMorgan Chase understand that and understand how important it is to get us '\n","  \"on the same growth trajectory. We've kind of had a reset of the \"\n","  \"relationship here in the past few months, and they've committed to getting \"\n","  'us to have the same kind of growth rates.\\n'\n","  \"And look, we are actually to be growing faster. We're growing faster as an \"\n","  \"airline. We're growing our capacity faster and so we frankly, ought to be \"\n","  \"growing faster than those guys. That's not at all on JPMorgan Chase, a lot \"\n","  \"of that is at United, things like we weren't allowing them to offer the \"\n","  \"credit card to customers onboard. That's the best acquisition channel that \"\n","  \"American Airlines had. It was -- I've been told best acquisition channel \"\n","  \"with Delta and United wasn't doing.\\n\"\n","  \"So, there are things that we can do to get our growth rates up. We're going \"\n","  'need to do it in combination with Chase, but we look forward to getting '\n","  'that accelerated in the months and years to come.'],\n"," ['So Scott, does that add some upside to what you laid out that Investor Day '\n","  'then?',\n","  \"There's nothing about that in the Investor -- assuming we're successful in \"\n","  'that regard it would be upside.'],\n"," ['Okay. And then Andrew, I guess, what we have done is really just value the '\n","  'business you guys have of -- and other airlines of selling miles to third '\n","  \"parties. But I'm just wondering if just bigger picture you can address the \"\n","  'opportunity you see for the company just being able to better monetize the '\n","  '90 million members you have in MileagePlus beyond just selling them air '\n","  'travel? I mean, this is a marketing company essentially. How much is each '\n","  'of those customers worth to you longer term beyond just selling them '\n","  'tickets?',\n","  'Hey, Joe, let me go back to the first answer by the way. I think Scott hit '\n","  \"the nail right on the head. We don't disclose the same way. If we did, the \"\n","  'difference in valuation would be much -- or the difference in the numbers '\n","  \"that you cited would be much smaller. And so as we mentioned, we're going \"\n","  'to work to find a way to disclose this really valuable business in a way '\n","  'that people can understand better because it is unique and very '\n","  'attractive.\\n'\n","  \"I think the question you asked about driving incremental revenue, I don't \"\n","  \"think that's limited to simply MileagePlus members. We communicate with a \"\n","  'lot of customers, we carry a lot of customers, we have a lot of this on the '\n","  \"website. And we've talked a lot about different ways we can monetize or do \"\n","  'a better job of monetizing the eyeballs that reach our website and the '\n","  'members of our mileage program and how to enhance our mileage program.\\n'\n","  \"So, I think that, that hasn't been the first priority. We're focused on the \"\n","  'things we talked about at Investor Day, which were kind of foundational. '\n","  \"But it is the focus of ours, and we've had a number of discussions and at \"\n","  'some point, we will really put a lot more time and effort into backsliding '\n","  'the opportunity there, which we do agree with you it exist and is quite '\n","  'substantial but really hard to quantify it.'],\n"," ['Hey good morning and thanks for taking my questions and Oscar, appreciate '\n","  'the comments. Accidents happen and I think your hard-working frontline in '\n","  'place probably deserve a little bit more credit than all the negative media '\n","  'attention. So hopefully, we can put this behind us. But from an investor '\n","  'perspective, I think, Scott, what folks are worried about here is that we '\n","  'saw the capacity increase domestically in the past month, one and a half.\\n'\n","  \"The concern here is that maybe we're a little bit more focused on market \"\n","  \"share than margins. You've benchmarked to Delta publicly. Their guidance \"\n","  'for 2Q is a good bit ahead of you here although you are showing a lot of '\n","  'sequential improvement in 2Q as well.\\n'\n","  'So, how can you re-ensure your investor base here that this capacity '\n","  'addition indeed is restructuring the network to help you capture that '\n","  'margin Delta and that we should be thinking this is going to be quite '\n","  'accretive as we move into 2018?',\n","  'Well, look, we used the term -- I try to avoid actually market share and '\n","  'try to say natural share more often than market share because this is not a '\n","  'play to go get market share. This is really about restoring United to its '\n","  'natural share. And United get a lot -- took a lot of accidents in the past '\n","  'three to four years, which caused it to lose its natural share and which '\n","  'hurt its financials.\\n'\n","  'And you guys used to get on this earnings call and beat them up about why '\n","  \"aren't your financials good. And you gave them a cure for that, which was \"\n","  'cut capacity, cut capacity, cut capacity and it just made the problem '\n","  'worse.\\n'\n","  'And despite taking the same medicine quarter-after-quarter as the numbers '\n","  'got worse and worse and worse that was part of the problem when the airline '\n","  'was cutting capacity and taking regional jets out of places that set the '\n","  'network like Rochester, Minnesota and redeploying them in places like '\n","  'Newark to Atlanta, in order to keep capacity low. That was driving margins '\n","  'lower.\\n'\n","  \"And so I'm trying to be careful to say what we're doing is restoring United \"\n","  \"to its natural market share, to a position it was in the past, and it's \"\n","  \"working so far. I mean, it's actually working faster even than I would have \"\n","  'thought, the fact that our guidance with this cutting capacity is for RASM '\n","  'up 1% to 3%.\\n'\n","  \"And by the way, we've got number of issues that are driving about -- our \"\n","  \"flown PRASM is actually higher than that. We've got some accounting issues \"\n","  'that are going to be 50 to 70 basis points headwind in this quarter. Those '\n","  'are just the things that happened, but our core performance is even '\n","  'stronger.\\n'\n","  'I mean, we just -- early on, we feel really good about how well this is '\n","  \"working.
